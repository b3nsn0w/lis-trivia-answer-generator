Here is a section of the wiki page for Joyce Price:

## Episode Four - "[Episode 4: Dark Room](dark_room.md)" 
In the [Alternative Timeline (Life is Strange)](alternative_timeline.md), Joyce is very caring for the paralyzed Chloe. She says she enjoys every moment she has with her family, and she doesn't want to think about Chloe's condition getting worse.

When Max returns to the [Timeline](original_timeline.md), she can observe the state of the relationship between David and Joyce.

Side with Chloe# Side with ChloeIn the normal timeline, she is really upset about David if Max sided with Chloe in the previous morning and divulged David's surveillance system on the entire Price household. She leaves a message for him, saying that she doesn't want him to be at home when she gets from work. Also, she has crumpled up her photo of her marrying David.
|-|Side with DavidSide with DavidIn the normal timeline, she is only annoyed at Chloe for just hurling wild accusations and picking a fight with her stepfather if Max sided with David in the previous morning by mentioning there was no real proof David was ever involved in Rachel's disappearance. David gave Joyce a treat at a fine restaurant and Joyce left a message suggesting that both David and Joyce bring Chloe along next time for a family outing together.

## Episode Five - "[Episode 5: Polarized](polarized.md)" 
Joyce is trapped inside the diner during the [storm](storm.md) with [Warren Graham](warren_graham.md), the [Old Guy](old_guy.md) and [Frank Bowers](frank_bowers.md) (if he was not killed by Chloe in [Episode 4: Dark Room](episode_4.md)). She is trying to aid Frank and the old man, who are hurt from the storm, and Warren has gathered first aid supplies to help out. Joyce is very glad to see Max. Max can encourage Joyce to stay with David.

She messaged Max asking if she has seen Chloe, while Max is trapped inside the [Dark Room (Location)](dark_room.md), which can be read later.

In the Sacrifice Chloe ending, she is among the people who attend Chloe's funeral. In the Sacrifice Arcadia Bay ending, sheÂ dies in the storm.

## Alternative Timeline 
In the [Alternative Timeline (Life is Strange)](alternative_timeline.md), Joyce works part-time at the [Pan Estates](pan_estates.md) owned by the [Prescott Family](prescott_family.md). It is implied that she still works at the Two Whales Diner but has to work both jobs in order to pay for the huge medical expenses due to Chloe's paralysis from the car accident.

Max may ask Joyce about David Madsen, and although she finds it strange, describes him as a cute and quiet person who stops by to eat at the diner sometimes. Beyond that, it is clear she has no romantic interest in him because she and her husband are obviously still in a loving relationship.

## Relationships 
'''Some of Max's actions can have consequences when it comes to the determinant relationships in Joyce's life.'''

#

## Romantic 
* [William Price](william_price.md) - Joyce and William were married, and it's clear from her frequent comments about him and her shrine to his memory that she deeply misses her departed husband. He died five years ago in 2008.
* [David Madsen](david_madsen.md) (**Determinant**) - In 2008, the two met in the Two Whales Diner and married sometime after. It is clear that Joyce loves David. However, there is the potential for Max to break the family apart if she blames David and reveals his surveillance addiction to Joyce. In this case, Joyce asks him to leave the house.

#

## Other 
* [Chloe Price](chloe_price.md) - Joyce's daughter, Chloe is a challenge for her. However, Joyce is clearly a loving mother and wishes nothing but the best for her only daughter.
* [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) - Joyce treats Max like a second daughter, no doubt due to her growing up as Chloe's best friend and spending much time with her and her family during the girls' childhood years. The two remark fondly about William, and they agree that they want the best for Chloe.

## Symbolism 

#

## Symbolism 
Joyce's hair clip is the same color blue we should associate with hope for the future and vulnerability. Joyce has much hope for the future and her family; eternally hoping that everything will work out okay for her daughter and husband. This changes in the alternative timeline, which is curiously symbolic of her loss of hope, due to knowing that her daughter is going to die.

#

## Spirit Animal 
There is a possibility that Joyce's spirit animal is the Whale.See here for more information: http://www.spiritanimal.info/whale-spirit-animal/ Due to her working for years in the Two Whales Diner, it seems to be the only animal associated with her at any point. Whales are generally associated with wisdom, emotional healing and the importance of family and community. All this makes sense when considering Joyce's personality. Whales are history keepers; the dead whales on the beach of Arcadia Bay could symbolize the death of the history of the Bay due to the destruction of the town via the upcoming tornado. Joyce's strong desire to keep her family together and to unify her daughter and husband (David) make sense when considering the whale as her totem.
