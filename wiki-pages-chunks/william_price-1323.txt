Here is a section of the wiki page for William Price:

## Episode One - "[Episode 1: Chrysalis](chrysalis.md)" 
Five years after William's death, Max returns to Arcadia Bay to attend [Blackwell Academy](blackwell_academy.md). After driving Max away from the [Blackwell Parking Lot](blackwell_parking_lot.md) confrontation, Chloe mentions that the death of her father was very hard on her, and with Max also gone she felt lonely and abandoned until meeting [Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md).

When Max looks through Chloe's room for a music tape she finds two photos of Chloe and William. One of these shows the two hugging, captioned "me + daddy" with a heart drawn next to it. The other is of Chloe and her dad in their backyard with Bongo in Chloe's hands. Upon finding the photos, Max remarks that Chloe and her dad were close. There are references to him throughout the household.

If Max decides to look through Joyce and David's bedroom, she can find a picture showing Joyce and William in their younger days inside a drawer in Joyce's bedside table. The photo was taken approximately nineteen years ago when Joyce was pregnant with Chloe. It is titled "SF Holidays with William (and Chloe)". The photo shows the couple kissing in front of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. After finding this, Max comments that "Joyce has a little shrine to William". Obviously, Joyce misses William greatly, but it seems that David, her current husband, understands her situation, allowing her to have her memorial shrine untouched.

When Max fails to fix her Polaroid camera, Chloe will give Max a replacement Polaroid camera that belonged to William. Max is initially hesitant about taking it, but Chloe insists, stating that "her Dad would be pissed if she never used it", and that she knows Max will use it the right way. William seemed to have taken all the family photos, and shared Max's love for analogue images.

## Episode Two - "[Episode 2: Out of Time](out_of_time.md)" 
While waiting for Chloe to arrive at the [Two Whales Diner](two_whales_diner.md), Max and Joyce talk about William. Max apologizes for not being there after his death, feeling guilty for not having supported the family while in Seattle. She realizes that things were tough for William's family after his death.

Joyce explains that she has done her best to move on after William's death, but Chloe remains in the past and became angry over his death, turning her into a rebel without a cause. Joyce believes that William's gift to the two after his passing were the good memories that they had; something Chloe does not understand yet.

In the [American Rust Junkyard](junkyard.md), Max spots an old car wreck and wonders if Chloe ever thinks about her father when she looks at them, alluding to the fact that the man was involved in a car accident.

## Episode Three - "[Episode 3: Chaos Theory](chaos_theory.md)" 
Episode 3 changes William's life drastically. As Chloe complains that her life is horrible solely due to the death of her father, Max becomes distraught and contemplates the situation in her bedroom.

Max's powers progress and allow her to visit the far-flung past via the last photograph William took of Chloe and Max. She travels back to the day William dies and becomes determined to save him and save Chloe from the pain of losing him. If she tries to warn Chloe and William about the upcoming accident, they won't take her warning seriously. Max succeeds in hiding William's car keys by either throwing them in the sink or in the backyard. This causes William to take the bus to help Joyce rather than taking his car, and allows him to avoid the car accident, living on in a new alternative timeline. Max skips time back to her 18-year old body, and finds herself in this alternative timeline, in which William is still alive.

This comes at the cost of Chloe being badly injured in the future after getting into a car crash in a new vehicle her father bought her. This tragically renders her paralyzed.

## Episode Four - "[Episode 4: Dark Room](dark_room.md)" 
In the new timeline, Max discovers that Chloe's accident is caused by a car-crash with an unknown SUV; fitting considering her father's past death. William and Joyce stay a happy couple, dealing with the stresses of having an entirely dependent daughter.

There is an extreme strain on the family's financial situation, as Chloe's medical bills threaten the Price family with foreclosure and bankruptcy. It is revealed that the family got to go to Paris, a lifelong dream for Joyce and Chloe; William even reveals that Chloe loved it so much she had considered going there for school before her accident. Despite the family's seemingly hopeless situation, William tries to stay optimistic, and makes jokes when talking to Max and looking at the loan letter. Inside a drawer in Chloe's new room, Max can find a photo of the Price family on the beach, with all the family members smiling.

Max discovers that Chloe is dying, and resolves to rewind to the day she changed William's fate. She sadly lets William leave the household to pick up Joyce, and his fate from the original timeline is repeated, returning the time stream to normal.

Chloe and Max make up, Chloe apologizing for her earlier behavior and teen drama, saying she didn't mean what she said about her father.

## Episode Five - "[Episode 5: Polarized](polarized.md)" 
William makes an appearance in [Max's Nightmare](max_s_nightmare.md) as Max reviews the scene of herself letting him die again. He also sends Max [Max's Messages#William](a_message.md) asking her to say hi to Chloe and Joyce.

## Alternative Timeline 
In the [Alternative Timeline (Life is Strange)](alternative_timeline.md), William is still alive due to the car crash never happening. He took his family on a holiday to Paris and bought Chloe a red pickup truck for her 16th birthday. He works extremely hard to care for Chloe, such as having three jobs.
