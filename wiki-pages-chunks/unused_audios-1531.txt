Here is a section of the wiki page for Unused Audios:

You're a phony. I hope you took a nice selfie when I hit the ground, Max. Remember: The last thing I ever saw was your face. Oh yes, Max, you care so much about me you told me to be strong. Yeah, that works. Next time you quote a bible, try to pick an apropos quote, idiot. My family doesn't care about me, understand? And if you think free hugs will save me you were out of your mind. Max, Nathan drugged me, and Jefferson took all those gross photos of me. I bet you wish you could take shots like that, huh? You might win a Pulitzer." {{Headphones|file# AFuckingMen.ogg}}
* Additional dialog between Dark-Chloe and the others from the Dark Room sequence of Max's nightmare. {{Headphones|fileYamamotoOuutfit.ogg}}
**Chloe and Victoria: "Damn Victoria, you're a real woman. Not a little girl like Max." - "Look at my Yamamoto outfit. I don't wear jeans and t-shirts like that hillbilly hipster." - "I bet you'd even get some hella cool ink with me." - " I fucking love your tats Chloe. You're soo hot." - "It's the company I keep." - "I can't believe it took us so long to hook up."
**Nathan and Chloe: Nathan: "I hear that. Do you..want to party? I have a drug store in my room." Chloe: "I bet you need it after that nerd Warren sucker punched you. Fuck yeah! Good thing Max stopped that nerd Warren from attacking you." Nathan: " Like I couldn't kick that homo's ass." Chloe: " I get so turned on watching bros fight. Let me show you Nathan."
**Warren to Max: "I'm glad you dumped in the friend-zone for Chloe. After everything I did for you.. You'll just use her up and shit her out."
**Warren and Chloe: Warren: "Have you seen her photography? My ten year old cousin does the same selfie shit. She doesn't end up in no art gallery." Chloe: "She's like all those artsy fartsy hipsters. But, Maxine would never get a tat. 'I'm too scared!' She wouldn't even turn in a photograph. She's just a coward. She never helped me."
**Chloe to Mr. Jefferson about Max: "She's as tough as tapioca."
**Warren to Chloe: "Damn, girl. You know how to make me feel like a man. Not a Max."
**Chloe to Max: "Are you cereal? You can't even strike a real pose. Hey Max, next time you get rewind skills, try banging everybody or at least win the lottery. Do you really need a toy camera to take pictures? Grow the fuck up.
* Max in the Dark Room scene of her nightmare. Max is distraught about Dark-Chloe and the real Chloe is trying to get her out of the nightmare. Max: "This is not real. Chloe, stop that. What's wrong with everybody? Max, you know this isn't happening. Do you think Chloe would act like that? Damn, this is cruel, just ignore everything. It's not real." Chloe: "Don't believe this. Max, you know that's not me. Dude, you know me better than that. Max, this is not reality. Damn, I would never pull that shit. Max, listen to my voice. Girl, you better trust me, not your dream." {{Headphones|file# ChloeStopThat.ogg}}
*There are several unused lines from the characters patrolling the stealth maze in Max's nightmare. [File:Headphones.png](16px.md)
**Mr. Jefferson: "Chloe and Rachel were trash compared to you." / "I don't trust men without goatees."
**David Madsen: "Hey, Max. Do you have any money I can borrow to take care of my family? It'll be hard... AFTER YOU GOT ME FIRED." / "Good thing you signed that petition to stop my surveillance system. How many more people will die because of you?"
**Frank: "He-he-hey. Thanks for killing me, Max. You're a real badass." / "I saved [Pompidou](pompidou.md), and you killed him. What an everyday hero." "You should never have kept Chloe's gun, Max. Did it save you?"
**Nathan: "You almost fucking killed Victoria with that paint can, dumbass. But I'm the scary one, huh?" / "You think I'm a freak? Haha. Who's the weirdo that wanted to see me get a bloody face?" / "Rachel never treated me like shit. But you... did." / "Warren is the real psycho Max. But you know that, right?" / "My dad used to beat me. But now, you've let Warren beat me." / "Too bad you didn't let Warren beat my ass. Now I'm gonna beat your ass, brah." / "Just admit it. You hate me because I'm rich. Admit it!" / "Did you know I loved Rachel? I never wanted to hurt anybody!" / "Does it feel good to have another dead Blackwell student on your conscience?"
**Principal Wells: "Poor Nathan Prescott was brutally beaten by Max and her punk posse. I've never seen such cruelty. She must pay." / "Max, it's your fault I drink whiskey in my office." (?)
**[William Price](william.md): "First you let me die again. Then you murder my little Chloe? Why, Max? Why?" / "Now that me and Chloe are both dead, are you gonna kill Joyce too?" / "You saw how much pain Chloe was in. Why didn't you do what she asked? What kind of friend are you?" / "Max, I'm so disappointed that you didn't honor my daughter's wishes. You saw what she was going through. Shame on you." / "Not only did you let me die twice, you can't even save my baby. You make me sick, Max." / "Max, I hope somebody gets to make the choice to let you die."This audio file shows that William was planned to appear in this sequence of Max's nightmare at one point. Max's lines at Warren's locker have William in the filename, so he might have been around
