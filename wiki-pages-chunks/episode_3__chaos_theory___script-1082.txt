## Epilogue 
*When Max "wakes up", she is sitting on the Blackwell campus at sunset, next to Hayden, Courtney, Logan, Nathan, Zachary, Taylor, and Victoria.''

**Student Comments in the Background**

**Girl:** You are such a ho-bag. I knew you'd hook up with that loser.

**Boy:** I'm not paying 150 dollars for a concert.

**Girl:** I heard that the Vortex Club parties are wild.

**Boy:** Dude, the service fee is like 50 percentâ€”

**Zachary/Logan:** So that's why she was laughing so hard.

**Taylor:** All my friends in [Los Angeles](la.md) told me that Oregon was gonna be wet and cold every day, but it's like 75 degrees and I haven't seen the rain once since I got here. Is that climate change?

**Courtney:** No, it's people in Oregon trying to keep Californians out.

*Max looks around in confusion.*

**Victoria:** Helloooo? Are you even listening, Maxine?

**Max:** Max, never Maxine.

**Victoria:** I know, sorry, Mad Max. You're not pissed at me, right? Right? Do you wanna go hit the girls' potty and smoke 'em peace pipe?

**Courtney:** I think Max is high...

**Taylor:** She's acting, like, so weird... You cool, Max?

**Courtney:** Nobody listened when I said we shouldn't let her in the Vortex...

**Taylor:** Courtney, you don't want anybody in the club.

**Courtney:** Like, whatever, bitch.

*Max gets up. She notices Warren and Stella holding hands.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Warren... He hooked up with Stella?

*Max runs across the campus.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Oh, no...this is totally fucked up! What else have I changed? Chloe!

''Max gets into the schoolbus, noticing that David Madsen is the bus driver. After driving for a while, the bus suddenly stops and everyone goes to look out the windows. Several whales are lying on the beach. Max goes to Chloe's house and knocks on the door, and William answers.''

**William:** Max Caulfield! Taking a break after taking Seattle by storm, huh? Hm... We thought we'd never see you after you left for the big city.

**Max:** No... I'd never do that to Chloe.

**William:** Speaking of...I know she's been dying to see you. Hold on.

*William turns around and steps back into the house.*

**William:** Chloe! You have a visitor!

*William steps to the side. Max sees Chloe and covers her mouth in shock as Chloe goes up to the door. Chloe is sitting in a wheelchair and a tube is attached to her neck. She smiles at Max.*
