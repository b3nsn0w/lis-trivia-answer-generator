## **Conversation with Warren** 

**Warren:** I hate to say I'm glad to see you, but I'm so glad to see you.

**Max:** That's okay. The important thing is that you're safe... and I know you can take care of yourself, after Nathan.

**Warren:** Should have done that a long time ago. But damn, Max... I can't believe you actually drove down here in the middle of a fucking E6 tornado, just for one photograph... I mean, I know you didn't come for me.

**Max:** Warren, I came for all of you. Just tell me you do have the photograph.

**Warren:** I just want...

**Max:** Now shut up and listen.

**Warren:** Oh yeah, you’re finally going to tell me what you never did in the parking lot...

**Max:** I wish I would have. So I'm just going to tell you without any explanation. Trust me, okay?

**Warren:** I always do. You should probably tell me quick...

**Max:** I had a vision in Jefferson's class of a tornado destroying Arcadia Bay. I went to the bathroom and saw my best friend Chloe get shot by Nathan Prescott...You with me so far?

**Warren:** Where else could I be? Go on!

**Max:** Then I found out that I could rewind time... And, long story short, Mark Jefferson is insane and dangerous.

**Warren:** Whoa... Is that all?

I started the storm.# I started the storm.**Max:** I think that this storm started... everything started... when I found out I could rewind time... There's no way this is just a coincidence, right?

**Warren:** Max, not only the storm but the eclipse, the birds, the whales... everything!

|-|He killed Chloe.He killed Chloe.**Max:** I have to go back in time. Jefferson already ki—killed Chloe... I can't let that happen... I have to do something, Warren!

**Warren:** Max, going back in time is what caused the storm!

**Max:** All because... because of me? How?

**Warren:** I'm not a real scientist, even though I play one at school, but this seems like pure cause and effect, maybe Chaos Theory... Uh, what happened with Jefferson? Did... Did he hurt you?

He dosed me.# He dosed me.**Max:** He used Nathan to get drugs and money for him. Jefferson tied me up and... dosed me with some drug and took sick photos of me... It was so horrible...

**Warren:** Max... I'm so sorry you had to go through all that... You're the bravest person I've ever known. Now, I want to kill that son of a bitch! Where is he?

{{#tag:tabber|(David killed Jefferson)(David killed Jefferson)**Max:** Dead.

{{!}}-{{!}}(David didn't kill Jefferson)# (David didn't kill Jefferson)**Max:** Busted.
}}

**Max:** History. Which I need to change fast to make it right again... Is that bad?

|-|Rachel was killed.Rachel was killed.**Max:** Nathan accidentally killed Rachel Amber trying to impress Jefferson...

{{#tag:tabber|(David killed Jefferson)# (David killed Jefferson)**Max:** He just needed mental help... Now... they're both dead.

{{!}}-{{!}}(David didn't kill Jefferson)(David didn't kill Jefferson)**Max:** Nathan just needed mental help... Now he's dead... and Jefferson is done.
}}

**Warren:** Jesus, Max! I want the whole story, but... I guess we really are out of time.

**Max:** But I can still change things. What do you think will happen?

**Warren:** For every action, there's... there's a reaction... Whenever you reversed or altered time, maybe you caused a chain reaction... even in the environment.

You believe me?# You believe me?**Max:** You're my friend, Warren. You believe me, right? I... I haven't told anybody else except for Chloe... and... and she can't help me right now...

**Warren:** I know I can be a pain in the ass... and... and you've always treated me like a person, not... not a beta nerd. I told you before that I'll always believe you...

**Max:** I just wish I could trust my powers...

|-|This is my fault?This is my fault?**Max:** All this destruction... is my fault?

**Warren:** Give me a break. You sure the hell didn't give yourself time travel powers...

|-|More time together.# More time together.**Max:** Warren, I know this all sounds insane... but you're the only other person who I can count on now... I wish we had more time together... Do you believe me?

**Warren:** Max, of course I believe you. You're the most amazing person I've ever met... and I'm glad you trust me.

**Max:** Always. I just wish I could trust my powers...

**Max:** I guess we'll never know if it's magic or science...

**Warren:** Even if it's from a wizard or a wormhole... You're part of something bigger. I don't believe in fate or destiny, but after this week, I realize I don't know shit.

**Max:** That makes both of us, Warren...

**Warren:** I do know you're here for a reason... and I guess it's up to you to find out why. Max... I'm sorry you got stuck in this... in this... I don't have a fucking clue what's going on. But I have total faith that you'll do the right thing when the time comes. I'm so proud of you, Max. How could there be a more important moment in history? And I'm in the middle of it with you? So thank you for trusting me.

**Max:** Thanks for being here. Always.

*Warren takes out the polaroid and places it in front of Max.*

**Warren:** Hey... Be careful out
