Here is a section of the wiki page for Kate Marsh:

## Friends 
*[Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) - Kate and Max soon started to befriend each other at Blackwell. Max considers her to be a natural beauty, which is only enhanced by her personality. They share an affection for tea and hold weekly tea sessions. During her depressive phase after the Vortex Club Party events, Max is the only true friend she has to turn to in the school, the only one actually trying to help her and caring for her. After stopping Kate from jumping off the roof top, Kate is rejuvenated with hope again, thanking Max for being supportive of her at her worst time. She considers Max an angel and tells her how much she loves her. She also tells her how much she admires her fearlessness, while Max always admired her kindness and natural beauty.
*[Alyssa Anderson](alyssa_anderson.md) and [Stella Hill](stella_hill.md) - They seem to have been rather good friends before the Vortex Club incident, but they weren't there for her when she suffered from bullying and was all on her own. However, Alyssa still defends Kate when the Vortex Club mocks her after not showing up to class, and is there for her after her suicide attempt.
*[Dana Ward](dana_ward.md) - Kate and Dana seem to be friends since before Max came to Blackwell. After Kate's suicide attempt, Dana mentions that she wasn't a good friend to Kate because she didn't help her in that roof while Max did. When asked about the video, Dana admits that she was watching Kate's video with Trevor. Dana promises to be a better friend or, if Max failed to talk Kate out of suicide, is regretful and wishes she was a better friend like Max.
*[Warren Graham](warren_graham.md) - Kate and Warren are friendly with each other and talk with each other from time to time. Kate talks very positively about him calling him a "smart and silly cutie-pie" with a good heart and suggests they take him with them to their tea-shop tour of Portland after her suicide attempt. She also supports Max's date with Warren if she accepted his invitation to the drive-in.

## Family 
* [Richard Marsh](richard_marsh.md) (father) - Richard appears to be a very loving and supportive father, especially after the publication of Kate's video, unlike the rest of the adults in Kate's family. In a postcard Max can find in Kate's room, her father calls her his "brightest light against the dark".
* [Mrs. Marsh](mrs__marsh.md) (mother) - Kate only says, "You don't know my mother," when Max says that she would care about her on the roof, leading to believe that they have a troubled relationship. From the e-mail she sent, it is clear Mrs. Marsh is judgmental, and automatically assumed Kate was completely guilty of what was shown in the Vortex video.
* [Lynn Marsh](lynn_marsh.md) (sister) - Lynn and Kate's other unnamed sister seem to have a good relationship with her based on the image in Kate's room where Kate smiles and eats ice cream with them. If Max mentions Kate's sisters on the roof, it doesn't have a negative effect on her, getting closer to stopping her from the attempt to commit suicide.
* [Auntie Marsh](auntie_marsh.md) - Auntie Marsh seems to have a bad relationship with Kate. Like her sister-in-law, she automatically assumed Kate was completely guilty. She writes a letter to Kate where she says that Kate "released [her] harlot image before God's eye". She also says that she will "pray for her soul to be saved from Eternal Hellfire".

## Enemies 
*[Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md) - He drugged Kate on a Vortex Club Party, which led to her being filmed while kissing strangers and ending up in Mr. Jefferson's Dark Room, which she doesn't recognize, but she knows he's done something terrible to her. She wants him to pay for what he's done to her and even thinks that there's something evil about the Prescotts that connects them with death. However, Nathan later expresses remorse, adding that he never intended to hurt Kate. He also reveals he has been used as a scapegoat by Jefferson.
*[Mark Jefferson](mark_jefferson.md) - Although not directly an enemy, Mr. Jefferson is far more of an antagonist towards Kate than she knows. When Kate attempts to find comfort from Mr. Jefferson he harshly advises her to stop being dramatic. As later revealed, Mr. Jefferson drugged, kidnapped and photographed her in his Dark Room and later on, subtly pushes her to attempt suicide for the sake of covering his tracks.
*[Victoria Chase](victoria_chase.md) - She spread Kate's video in Blackwell and even build up a homepage. Despite this, after her suicide attempt, Victoria sends her a letter offering her help and even dedicates her Everyday Hero Contest prize to Kate. Kate acknowledges that she really struggles with her guilt and, despite her mean behavior, is actually insecure about herself, and so decides to forgive her.
*[Taylor Christensen](taylor_christensen.md) - Considered enemies due to her being one of Victoria's "minions". She supported the spreading of Kate's video and took part in the bullying on Kate. After Kate's attempted suicide, Taylor is shown to be regretful of her actions towards Kate however and even brings her flowers when Kate is at the hospital.
