Here is a section of the wiki page for Nathan Prescott:

## Enemies 
*[Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) - The intensity of his hostility toward Max can be determined on whenever or not she has made choices that could harm Nathan in any way. Despite his apparent dislike for her, his behavior towards Max is less aggressive if she has chosen not to tell Principal Wells about him carrying a gun in the girls bathroom, to make fun of Victoria for getting paint on herself or to blame him for Kate's attempt to commit suicide. Nevertheless, Nathan confronts Max at the parking lot in Episode 1 and when he catches her and Chloe breaking into his dormitory room and stealing his mobile phone in Episode 4. Also, in the same episode, she's not reluctant in helping Chloe to get her revenge against him for killing Rachel. However, regardless of Max's choices, in Episode 5, Nathan will leave Max a voicemail, apologizing for everything and warning her about Mark Jefferson.
*[Chloe Price](chloe_price.md) - Chloe and Nathan despise each other. Chloe met Nathan at a bar when he was wasted, and tried to use his drunken state to con him out of money she could use to pay back Frank. But Nathan spiked her drink and took photos of her in her vulnerable state before she could escape his dormitory room. Deducing that Nathan deals drugs at Blackwell, she planned to blackmail him for money. Nathan grows angry at Chloe and threatens her to stay away, and even accidentally shoots her without Max's intervention. After it becomes clear that Nathan is partially responsible for the drugging, photographing and death of Rachel Amber, Chloe is on the warpath with him and resolves to get revenge for her friend.
*[Luke Parker](luke_parker.md) - Like many students at Blackwell, Luke despises Nathan. Max can talk to Luke about Nathan getting attacked by Warren, resulting in Luke being satisfied.
*[Warren Graham](warren_graham.md) - When Nathan attacks Max in the parking lot, Warren tries to intervene, resulting in a fight between the two that gets Warren a black eye. Later on, when Nathan is about to attack Max in the male dormitory, Warren again puts himself between them. Warren head-butts Nathan to the floor, causing Nathan to pull out a gun and levy a death threat against Warren, Max, and Chloe. Warren kicks the gun out of Nathan's hand, and, if Max chooses not to intervene, Nathan receives a brutal beating from him.
*[Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md) - Nathan drugged Kate on a Vortex Club Party, which led to her being filmed while kissing strangers and ending up in Mr. Jefferson's Dark Room, which she doesn't recognize, but she knows he's done something terrible to her. She wants him to pay for what he's done to her and even thinks that there's something evil about the Prescotts that connects them with death.
*[Mark Jefferson](mark_jefferson.md) - Jefferson is responsible for taking advantage of Nathan's mental condition and bad relationship with his father in order to use him as a scapegoat and tool to further his twisted agenda. Nathan looks to Mark Jefferson as a mentor and father figure, and Mark uses this to his advantage. He also murders Nathan to cover up his own crimes.
*[Samuel Taylor](samuel_taylor.md) - Most Vortex Club members view Samuel as a "freak," it seems Nathan is no exception, he even threatened him for unknown reasons.

## Romantic 
* [Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md) - According to Jefferson, Nathan was in lust with Rachel. They were likely engaging in intimate behavior before Rachel's disappearance, as Rachel was known to have hooked up with many Vortex Club members. It is also worth noting that Nathan wrote, "69 REASONS TO BANG RACHEL" in the boys' locker room. According to Jefferson, his obsession went so far that he chose her as a model by following Jefferson's footsteps to impress him and drugged her, but accidentally killed her by giving her an overdose. After her death, he was traumatized and feels deeply sorry for what happened to her, since he "never wanted to hurt Rachel or anybody". However, Jefferson could be lying, especially seeing the photos of Nathan, spaced out and lying under Rachel as well as the fact that he seems oblivious to Rachel's death (he assumes disappearance) in the diner scene when Max enters wearing Rachel's clothes.
* [Victoria Chase](victoria_chase.md) - There are a few implications of Nathan having romantic feelings for Victoria, such as starting many emails with "Hey gorgeous." When Max asks the people at the End of the World Party for Nathan's whereabouts, everybody says that it's Victoria who usually knows where he is. As Taylor Christensen said, "Vic is close with Nathan. They're more like brother-sister. Or something... She really cares about him." According to Dontnod, Victoria and Nathan have a relationship that is not quite clear.Life Is Strange [Director's Commentary](director_s_commentary.md): ''"Like Victoria here, we can see her crying when clearly this is not the way her character would behave before, and having Nathan coming into her room, we don't know what is happening between the two of them, but it's still bringing a bit of mystery and interest for the characters and for the player."'' Many believed that their relationship was just one-sided, but it was already proven that Nathan also cares about Victoria.

## Symbolism

## Color Symbolism 
Nathan is associated with the color red (his jacket and his car), which can symbolize a number of things including danger, rage, wrath and stress as well as passion, longing, lust, sensitivity and action. Nathan is most obviously characterized by his blatant aggression and stress and paranoid behavior, as signified by red. The circumstances of the pressure placed on him by his family name and several other people can also be presumed to be reflected by the color. He also strives to emulate Mark Jefferson's photography. The color red also represents lust which Nathan has for Rachel. His coat can also symbolize the fact that he is a "red herring", for Mr. Jefferson.

Red is considered a particularly "emotionally intense" color that "increases respiration rate" and "raises blood pressure".[https://resources.oncourse.iu.edu/access/content/user/rreagan/Filemanager_Public_Files/meaningofcolors.htm Resource site] listing the symbolism of several colors, including red. This is a testament to Nathan's anxiety and quick-to-anger attitude, as well as the previously mentioned danger in relation to his personality.

## Spirit Animal 
It's discussed whether the whale could be Nathan's spirit animal. This is due to the fact that Nathan listens to whale songs, and also, the deaths of the whales in Arcadia Bay could have been foreshadowing to the death of the Prescott heir.
