## **Conversation with Chloe**# 

*Chloe enters through a door in the back of the VIP area and waits for Max.*

**Max:** There you are. Chloe, Nathan isn't here. Nobody has seen him tonight.

**Chloe:** He’s definitely not upstairs or in the lockers.

**Max:** Damn, maybe he's hiding in his dorm.

**Chloe:** Then let’s bail. Nathan can’t hide anymore.

*Max and Chloe start to walk towards the exit. Mr. Jefferson blocks them.*

**Mr. Jefferson:** So you made it, Max.

**Max:** Oh, hey, Mr. Jefferson...

**Mr. Jefferson:** Um... are you both okay? You look like you're on a mission...

**Max:** Oh, I was just looking for Nathan.

**Mr. Jefferson:** Aha. I didn't know you were pals with him. I haven't seen him since this afternoon... He seemed pretty upset. I think he's still quite upset over the whole Kate situation.

**Max:** Yeah, that makes sense.

**Mr. Jefferson:** Let's talk later, Max. I have to announce the winner of the contest. I do wish you would have entered. You have to build up that résumé and portfolio, but I know you will.

**Max:** Thanks, I hope so.

**Mr. Jefferson:** Okay, excuse me. I’m almost on...

**Chloe:** Let’s get the hell out of here, Max.

''Chloe puts her hand on Max's back and they leave the VIP area. Mr. Jefferson walks over to the DJ booth and takes the microphone.''

## **"Everyday Heroes" Contest**# 

**Mr. Jefferson:** Okay, everybody calm down. Thank you, thank you... I appreciate it. I don't want to get in the way of the party, but it's time to announce the winner of the "Everyday Heroes" contest.

''Max stops to watch. Chloe, annoyed, grabs Max's wrist and unsuccessfully tries to pull her towards the exit.''

**Mr. Jefferson:** Before I do, I want to thank everybody who entered their photograph... and everybody who thought about entering. Now, this is the most important step in being an artist—sharing your work with the world. All of you represent Blackwell Academy, and everything our school stands for. As far as I'm concerned, you're all "Everyday Heroes"! The envelope, please... And the winner is… Oh my, what a shocker... Victoria Chase!

**Victoria:** Oh my God!

*Victoria takes the microphone from Mr. Jefferson.*

**Victoria:** Thank you so much, Mr. Jefferson. It was your incredible photography that brought me to Blackwell and I hope I can live up to your name... and fame. I also want to thank all the students for being so dedicated in their pursuit.

(Kate died)(Kate died)

**Victoria:** And I'd like to dedicate this prize to the memory of Kate Marsh... She was the real "everyday hero" of Blackwell...

|-|(Kate lived)# (Kate lived)

**Victoria:** And I'd like to dedicate this prize to Kate Marsh... She is the real "everyday hero" of Blackwell. And I can't wait for her to come back.

**Victoria:** Thank you.

**Stella:** You suck, Victoria!

**Max:** Victoria won. Big surprise. I can't believe she blackmailed Jefferson... Well... yes, I can.

**Chloe:** Who fucking cares? Rachel is still dead. And I want Nathan's punk ass... now!

**Max:** Me too. Let’s go check out the dormitories.

*Max and Chloe leave the party. Once outside, Chloe gets a text from Nathan that says:*
**glad you got one last look at rachel**
**nobody will ever find her again after im done**

**Chloe:** Oh Christ, Nathan just texted me... He says there won't be any evidence left after he's done.

**Max:** Shit, we have to go to the junkyard right now!

*Max and Chloe run to the truck. The scene fades out on the two moons, one of which is disappearing.*
