Here is a section of the wiki page for Episode 1: Chrysalis - Script:

## **Nightmare** 
**Max:** *(thinking)* Oh, no! Not again... Why is this happening to me? Why am I here again? Is Chloe still up there? I have to find out!

*Max follows the ghost doe to the top of the hill as a boulder falls down the left fork in the road. Thunder crashes and lightning strikes a tree, causing it to fall down in front of Max. She rewinds and walks up the path as the tree falls behind her. Max continues to follow the ghost doe up the steps to the lighthouse.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* I've never seen a storm like this in Oregon...

*A pile of logs crashes down the path in front of Max. She rewinds and stands in the area next to the path as they fall past her. She continues toward the lighthouse.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Oh, my lord! The tornado is back! Is this for real...?

*A boat flies out of the tornado and crashes into the lighthouse.*

**Max:** Whoa, shit!

*Debris rains down and knocks the fallen tree blocking the road into the ocean below. The top of the lighthouse falls down and balances precariously on the edge of the cliff. It slowly tips over and falls into the ocean, taking chunks of the cliff with it so Max cannot cross. Max rewinds and crosses to the bench area after the debris rains down. The lighthouse roof falls over again behind her. Max then reads the newspaper stuck on the railing.*

**Max:** October 11th? Is this Friday? That's only four days away!

''The wind tears the newspaper out of Max's hands. Max watches the tornado.*

**Max:** Oh, no...

**Max:** *(thinking)* That tornado is headed straight for the town...

*Chloe's hand touches Max's shoulder. Max's vision ends and she finds herself back with Chloe at sunset. Max falls to the ground and Chloe kneels beside her.''

**Max:** Chloe! You're here! I'm back. Oh, my lord, this is realâ€”it's real! Oh, man, this sucks...

**Chloe:** Max, what's going on? You totally blacked out.

**Max:** I didn't black out... I had another vision. The town is going to get wiped out by a tornado...

**Chloe:** Oregon gets about five tornadoes every twenty years; you just zoned.

''Max grabs Chloe's wrist.''

**Max:** No, no, I saw it! I could actually feel the electricity in the air...

**Chloe:** Come on, take a breath, okay?

**Max:** Chloe, I'm not crazy. But there's something else I have to tell you... Something...hardcore.

**Chloe:** Talk to me, Max.

**Max:** I had this same vision earlier in class... When I came out of it, I discovered I could reverse time. Like I said: not crazy.

**Chloe:** But high, right?

**Max:** Listen to me, how do you think I saved you in the bathroom?

**Chloe:** By reversing time? Yeah, sure.

**Max:** I saw you get shot, Chloe. Saw you actually...die. I was able to go back and hit the fire alarm...

**Chloe:** Okay, I see you're a geek now with a great imagination, but this isn't anime or a video game; people don't have those powers, Max.

**Max:** I don't know what I have, but I have it. And I'm scared shitless.

**Chloe:** You need to get high. It's been a hella insane fucking day...

*Max begins shaking her head. A snowflake falls on her face and she wipes it away. Max and Chloe watch as snow begins falling all around them.*

**Chloe:** What...the hell is this?

**Max:** Snowflakes...?

*Chloe gets up.*

**Chloe:** It's, like...eighty degrees. How?

*Max gets up.*

**Max:** Climate change...or a storm is coming.

**Chloe:** Max...start from the beginning. Tell me everything...

*Max and Chloe begin talking indistinctly as the screen zooms out and then fades to black.*

*David stands on a ladder fixing one of the surveillance cameras at the house. He pauses to stare at the falling snow.*
