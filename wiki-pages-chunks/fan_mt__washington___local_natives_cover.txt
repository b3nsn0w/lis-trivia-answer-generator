##  Lyrics 

:Face stained in the ceiling
:Why does it keep saying
:I don't have to see you right now
:I don't have to see you right now

:Digging like you can bury
:Something that cannot die
:Or we could wash the dirt off our hands now
:Keep it from living underground

:Lazy summer goddess
:You can tell our whole empire
:I don't have to see you right now
:I don't have to see you right now

:I don't have to see you right now
:I don't have to see you right now
:I don't have to see you right now
:I don't have to see you right now
