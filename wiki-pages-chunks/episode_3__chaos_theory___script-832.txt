factory.

**Chloe:** See if you can find a suitable outfit in my fashion hole.

*Max opens the closet.*

**Max:** Okay, time for some Chloe cosplay...

**Chloe:** Hey, there you go! Rachel left a bunch of her clothes with me... She's your size.

**Max:** But not quite my style.

**Chloe:** Max, you don't have a style yet. At least give it a try. You can always rewind back to your chlorine brand T-shirt and generic jeans.

**Max:** You suck. I like my shirt and jeans... but it would be cool to try on Rachel's clothes, just to see if they fit.

**Chloe:** Stop second-guessing yourself, Max! Put this on and let your inner punk-rock girl come out! You can afford to take chances! Whenever and whatever you want to try... for example, I dare you to kiss me!

**Max:** What?

**Chloe:** I double dare you. Kiss me now.

KISS CHLOEKISS CHLOE*Max leans forward and kisses Chloe. Chloe backs away in surprise.*

**Chloe:** Damn, you're hardcore, Max! Now I can text Warren and tell him he doesn't stand a chance... unless he's into girl-on-girl action.

*Chloe returns to her bed.*

**Max:** You are such a dork.

**Max:** *(thinking)* Oh man, that was priceless when I kissed Chloe. She didn't think I would...

|-|DON'T KISS CHLOE# DON'T KISS CHLOE**Max:** Sorry, not that easy.

**Chloe:** Oh, like I am? Just admit that you already macked on me then used your rewind! Now I can text Warren that you're saving yourself all for him...

*Chloe returns to her bed.*

**Max:** I am so going to best unfriend you for that.

**Max:** *(thinking)* I love that Chloe is so fearless...

**Optional Conversation with Chloe**

(Kissed Chloe)(Kissed Chloe)**Chloe:** You better not rewind and take that kiss back. You know I'm hotter than those Seattle art-holes, right?
|-|(Didn't kiss Chloe)# (Didn't kiss Chloe)**Chloe:** I bet you totally used your rewind to mack on me just so you could act like you didn't... Come on girl, confess!

''Max puts on Rachel's shirt and jeans. She then stands in front of Chloe.''

**Chloe:** Lookin' sick, Max. A couple tats, some piercings and we'll make a thrasher out of you yet.

**Max:** Ready for the mosh pit, shaka brah.

**Chloe:** Maybe not. Go on down and say hi to Joyce. Free breakfast! I have to, er, wake 'n' bake first.

**Max:** I promise not to tell.

**Chloe:** Let's not rewind and find out, 'kay?

''Max exits Chloe's room.*

**Max:** *(thinking)'' Oh my God, that smells so amazing... It's like when we were kids here.

*Max goes downstairs.*
