|Hi Bill,

Sorry for not staying in touch since the accident.
Work has been piling up and I'm being sent to Salt Lake City
to oversee a new parking lot. You have to go where the work is these days.

I wish I could have sent you a bigger check but you know the story. Money is nobody's favorite thing.

Maybe I'll see you next spring for a visit.

Kiss Chloe and Joyce for me.

Hang in there, Billy.

Your brother,

Aaron

|SUBJECT: Thanks for the pressure washer!

Finally used your pressure washer today and I just wanted to say thanks again for letting me borrow it! Works like a charm! It‘s not our dream house, but now it can at least be the right color!

If you want to come over next weekend and give me a hand, there'll be a cold beer in it for you! Give me a call!

Hope everything at work is still going well, and tell Linda I say hello!
