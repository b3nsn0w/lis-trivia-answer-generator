Here is a section of the wiki page for Warren Graham:

## Episode One - "[Episode 1: Chrysalis](chrysalis.md)" 
In this first episode, one of Max's first objectives is to return Warren's flash drive. After rescuing it from [Dana's Room](dana_s_room.md), the two girls talk about how Warren blatantly likes Max. It seems that Max is aware of his advances. Max does, however, suggest that [Brooke Scott](brooke_scott.md) would be perfect for him due to her similar interests in science. Warren approaches Max with a hug, which she denies as she hands him back his flash drive.

The humorous moment ends and the two talk about the various films on the USB, but they are interrupted by [Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md), and an argument breaks out. Warren intervenes to protect Max, but Nathan headbutts him to the ground.

As Max escapes in [Chloe Price](chloe_price.md)'s [Chloe's Truck](truck.md), Warren distracts Nathan, getting beat up in the process. He later sends Max a text with a photo of him with a black eye saying she owes him.

At the end of the episode, Warren can be seen in the [Science Lab](science_lab.md) with a laptop during the snowstorm.

## Episode Two - "[Episode 2: Out of Time](out_of_time.md)" 
At the beginning of the episode, Warren makes a small appearance outside the [Prescott Dormitory](blackwell_dorms.md) before Max moves from [Max's Room](her_room.md). He can be seen if Max walks over to the leftmost window of her room as soon as she gets out of bed and looks out towards the corner of the campus. He peeks around the corner, possibly looking to see if she is up and awake.

When Max talks to [Alyssa Anderson](alyssa_anderson.md) on the dormitory floor, she tells her that Warren mentioned that she borrowed his flash drive and warns her to be careful of Brooke, who she thinks Max may make jealous. Alyssa also wishes her "good luck" with Warren.

Warren interrupts Max as she leaves the campus for the [Two Whales Diner](two_whales_diner.md) to meet Chloe, still pumped from his show of aggression and labeling himself a "White Knight". They have a conversation about Chloe and Nathan, and Warren asks how she knows Chloe and why Nathan is after her. He then asks her to go on a date and see a *Planet of the Apes* movie marathon at a drive-in. Max can choose to accept or decline.

Accept# Accept 
If Max accepts Warren's invitation Warren thinks it was easier than he thought and will text her later about it. He will also mention that he will text Brooke that he's going to the movies with Max instead of her.
|-|DeclineDecline
If Max declines Warren's invitation, obviously hurt, he will say, "Fine. Be a damned dirty human. I'll go Ape myself." He will also mention that he wants to ask Brooke to go to the drive-in with him instead. 

Later that day, Warren sends Max a text asking her to meet him at the Science Lab. Max can go to the Science Lab and help him with his chemistry experiment. If Max helps him correctly, she can boost Warren's grade later in the week.

Right before [Mark Jefferson](mr__jefferson.md)'s class begins, Warren walks up to Max to talk to her about [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md) who ran past him on her way out of the building.

When [Zachary Riggins](zachary_riggins.md) informs Jefferson's class that "crazy shit" is happening at the girls' dormitory, Warren and the rest of the class head for the dorm grounds. Warren is among the many students watching Kate's attempted or successful suicide. When Max manages to stop time, Warren can be seen in the crowd comforting Alyssa.

At the end of the episode, Max and Warren are seen together discussing the day's events. They are both shocked when they see the eclipse. Warren mentions that he would know if any eclipse was predicted to occur, and this eclipse seems to defy all conventional logic. When Warren sees that Max is feeling cold from the abrupt change in temperature due to the eclipse, he moves closer to Max to keep her warm.

## Episode Three - "[Episode 3: Chaos Theory](chaos_theory.md)" 
When Chloe and Max enter Blackwell at night to search for clues in the Principal Wells' office, Max calls Warren and asks him for instructions on how to build a pipe bomb. Depending on whether Max chose to accept his invitation to "Go Ape" or not, they have a short conversation based on the answer.

Warren then texts her the materials she needs to build the pipe bomb. Max uses the pipe bomb to blow open the door into Principal Wells's office. Rewinding to remove the damage, Max unlocks the office door. After letting Chloe enter the office, Max discards all the materials for the pipe bomb in a waste bin inside the office. Max also texts Warren, jokingly saying that she only wanted to test his scientific knowledge and expertise regarding the pipe bomb.
