(Saved Kate)**Brooke:** I'm here, as usual. By the way, thanks for helping Kate down. Are you okay?

Drone.# Drone.**Max:** I might feel better taking your drone for a quick flight...

{{#tag:tabber|(Accepted Warren's invitation)(Accepted Warren's invitation)**Brooke:** Ms. Grant finally gave up and let me fly her again. But you're going to the drive-in with Warren, so you don't have time to fly my drone.

**Max:** Really? I can't fly your drone because I'm going to see "Ape" movies with Warren?

**Brooke:** You are perceptive, Max. Now, excuse me. My drone needs me.

{{!}}-{{!}}(Declined Warren's invitation)# (Declined Warren's invitation)**Brooke:** Ms. Grant caved and let me fly her again. So, take a spin! I have to see what time I'm going to the drive-in with Warren on Saturday.

{{#tag:tabber|Sounds fun.Sounds fun.**Max:** That sounds fun. It would be good for you and Warren to take a road trip after this week.

**Brooke:** Warren got a new car. Or an old new car. So, I'm all about a serious road trip out of here after this week.

{{!}}-{{!}}He asked you?# He asked you?**Max:** Oh, he asked you to go to the drive-in with him? Well... that's cool.

**Brooke:** I love the drive-in in Newberg. So old school, but so much fun... like Warren.

{{#tag:tabber|(Nathan is suspended)(Nathan is suspended)**Max:** Come on, Brooke, don't be that way. Nathan was suspended, but he should still be on campus.

{{!}}-{{!}}(Nathan isn't suspended)# (Nathan isn't suspended)**Max:** Okay, Brooke, um, but right now I'm trying to find Nathan.

}}

**Brooke:** Warren's not good enough for you? Okay. I saw Nathan pissed and walking off campus earlier. Good luck getting that date, Max.

{{!}}-{{!}}(Declined Warren's invitation)(Declined Warren's invitation)**Brooke:** I was distracted by Warren asking me out to the drive-in.

{{#tag:tabber|(Nathan is suspended)# (Nathan is suspended)**Max:** Nathan was suspended, but he should still be on campus.

{{!}}-{{!}}(Nathan isn't suspended)(Nathan isn't suspended)**Max:** It's a school day, so Nathan should be around.

|-|Whales.# Whales.**Max:** I can't get my limited brain around that eclipse and the beached whales... I was hoping the science department had some ideas.

**Brooke:** Warren and I are supposed to compare notes and theories this weekend.

{{#tag:tabber|That makes sense.That makes sense.**Max:** That makes sense. Two big brains are better than one...or mine.

**Brooke:** We'd get the Nobel Prize if we could explain this phenomenon, but even Ms. Grant has no clue...

{{!}}-{{!}}He asked you?# He asked you?**Max:** Oh, he asked you?

**Brooke:** You know, science geeks stick together. But honestly, neither of us can explain this phenomenon... It's pretty scary.

|-|Leave.Leave.**Max:** I have to go. Talk later, Brooke.

*If Max talks to Brooke again:*

**Max:** Back again, Brooke.

**Brooke:** Are you sure you're alright?

''If Max talks to Brooke again after exhausting all dialogue options / asked about drone but accepted Warren's invitation:*

**Brooke:** Talk to you later, Max.

**Conversation with Chloe**

*Chloe turns around when Max approaches. She gives Justin a high-five and a fist-bump, and then walks to Max.''

**Max:** Coast is clear. It would be so cool if you and me were going to school here together...

**Chloe:** But now you can have Mr. Jefferson all to yourself...

**Max:** Ugh, you suck. Now let's get into Blackwell Ninja mode.

''Max and Chloe enter the Boys' Dormitories.*
