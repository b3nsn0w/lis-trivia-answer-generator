{{#tag:tabber|Too late.# Too late.**Max:** Too late... and I had the power to change things.

**Max:** Just to find some answers...

**Homeless Lady:** I'm probably a bigger snoop than you. People pretend to not see me, so I see everybody. And everything.

{{#tag:tabber|(Nathan is suspended)(Nathan is suspended)**Homeless Lady:** That spoiled shit finally got kicked out of his daddy's school...

{{!}}-{{!}}(Nathan isn't suspended)# (Nathan isn't suspended)**Homeless Lady:** That spoiled shit just has a bad aura, as we used to say...
