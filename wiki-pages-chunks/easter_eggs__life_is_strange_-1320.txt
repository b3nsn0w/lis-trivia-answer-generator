## 555 Phone Numbers 
Whenever a telephone number is mentioned in the game, it has the prefix 555. That does not have anything to do with [Arcadia Bay](arcadia_bay.md), however. The prefix 555 is widely used for fictitious telephone numbers in North American television shows, films, video games and other media in order to prevent curious callers from bothering real people and organisations by telephoning numbers they see in works of fiction.To read more about the prefix 555- used for fictitious telephone numbers see *{{Wiki|555 (telephone number)|here}}*.
