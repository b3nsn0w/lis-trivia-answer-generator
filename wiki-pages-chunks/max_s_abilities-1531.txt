Here is a section of the wiki page for Max's Abilities:

#  Max's Abilities 

[Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md)'s **time-manipulation abilities** are a key element of *[Life is Strange](life_is_strange.md)*, and her discovery of these set off the events of the game. Likely triggered by the shocking experience of seeing a "[Chloe Price](blue_haired_girl.md)" get shot in the girls' bathroom at [Blackwell Academy](blackwell_academy.md), Max's discovers Powers for the very first time in [Episode 1: Chrysalis](episode_1.md) as she turns back time to a moment in [Mark Jefferson](mark_jefferson.md)'s [Photography Lab](classroom.md) where she then discovers she can rewind time. Throughout the game's events, Max’s Time Manipulation abilities is shown in various ways, Which she eventually discovers not only can she rewind time but she can manipulate time and her rewinding time is just one of the many abilities of time manipulation she can do which are listed below.

## Temporal Rewind 
{{Main|Rewind}}
Max's most frequently used power is the ability to reverse the flow of time; she can comfortably rewind time several seconds to a few minutes. Max herself is unaffected by the time alteration, remaining in a fixed position while time flows backwards around her while being also conscious, and she retains all recollection of what happened afterwards. As a side effect of this, Max may seem to suddenly disappear and/or appear out of nowhere to those under the effects of her powers (i.e. by moving to a different location and then rewinding time, this allows her to be in a different location than where she was standing originally). Any item(s) on her person before time traveling are also kept with her after the fact. As a focus for her powers, Max normally extends her hand out to rewind time. It is unknown if this short-burst method of time travel entails any paradoxes as even her small changes may contribute to a butterfly effect.

## “Teleporting” 
Max can use also use her rewind ability to erase the physical position of her old self/spatial location by walking to a new location, rewinding, and then resuming time. To bystanders, it would probably seem that Max has teleported unless it is done cleverly with nobody around or vigilant enough, such as when Max teleports to behind the principal's office door when she knows nobody would be inside, or when she can push an obstacle out of her way at the [Blackwell Swimming Pool](blackwell_pool.md) party and appear on the other side, and any surprise from those present could perhaps be passed off as a drunken hallucination.

## Spontaneous Time Jumps 
While her rewind usually enables Max to reverse time with her body & Consciousness and whatever she's holding/has with her being immune , she discovers her rewind ability the first time with a "jump" back in the Blackwell bathroom during the attempt of saving Chloe and then suddenly finds herself back in the classroom (meaning that she Rewinded Time temporarily to the time she was in Mrs Jefferson's classroom with only her Consciousness being immune to it). In the [Director's Commentary](director_s_commentary.md), [Michel Koch](michel_koch.md) said that they honestly don't have a good explanation for it. It could be a deeper manifestation of her rewind ability that requires a lot of energy — energy she was only able to muster in such a dramatic and stressful situation.

## Future Vision 
{{Main|Max's Visions}}
Max can see the future to some extent. Through lucid visions, Max was able to witness [Arcadia Bay](arcadia_bay.md) being destroyed by an oncoming storm. During these visions, Max seemed to be experiencing the future event first-hand; thus it's possible that they aren't just visions but rather 'time jumps'. Her experiencing these specific visions may stem from having saved Chloe from dying and in turn causing a butterfly effect.

## Temporal Freezing 
Max has the power to freeze time while also being able to move normally.Although freezing time was implemented as a game mechanic to give the player time to get Max into the dormitory building before Kate jumped, it is still a power that Max has, as stated by [Raoul Barbet](raoul_barbet.md) in [https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1023468/-Life-is-Strange-Case this video] from the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in 2016 - from the 22:02 time stamp. A visual cue that Max is using her power is her constantly extended right hand that remains in front of her as she walks slowly towards the building. Max discovered this ability during her attempt to save [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md) from committing suicide, but the amount of concentration to maintain it was extremely harsh on her body, as seen by her being rendered too weak to use her rewind power after she made it up to the roof (her nose also bleeds a little). Similar to when she is reversing time, Max held her hand out during the duration of time being frozen.

## Pause 
Max can also pause time without being able to move. This ability comes in handy when she faces a difficult decision, mainly in dialogues. It is also essential during more serious situations, such as when she attempts to prevent something bad from happening; it assures she will not pass the time frame of her rewind ability or have to witness the consequence of her (in)action. It is unknown whether Max's nose bleeds are the result of an accumulative use of pausing or whether a pause can be sustained indefinitely.The pausing of time and rewinds can be sustained for as long as the player sustains it as a game mechanic.

## Chronoskimming 
[File:PolaDrawing.png](thumb.md)
By focusing on a photograph, Max can transfer her consciousness back to the time period when the photo was taken in order to [Timestream](change_the_past.md) and the present and the future. However, once there, she is unable to pass the 'photographic bounds' (i.e. the areas of her environment that seem "out of focus") while the ability is in use. The ability also appears to be limited to photographs in which Max herself is visibly present, whether as a reflection in her own photographyMax is seen reflected on a metal surface of a bucket in her [Blue Butterfly](blue_butterfly.md) photograph. or a subject of someone else's. Max is also confined to exist within the physical form she was in when the photo was taken (i.e. going back in time using a five-year-old photo put her 18-year-old mind inside her 13-year-old body), so if she were to use a photo of when she was two, her mind would be placed in her two-year-old body. 
This ability is used several times throughout the game when Max needs to go to distant past moments.
