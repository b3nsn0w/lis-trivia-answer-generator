Here is a section of the wiki page for Brooke Scott:

## Episode Two - "[Episode 2: Out of Time](out_of_time.md)" 
In Episode 2, Brooke is standing in the hallway of the girls' dormitory with [Juliet Watson](juliet_watson.md). Both of them are watching the viral video of [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md), and a surprised Brooke comments that she didn't think Kate was like that and says, "Macking on those bros? Ew." When Juliet has second thoughts about them watching the video, Brooke remains indifferent and says, "Everybody's seen it by now..."

If Max decides to talk to Brooke, Max will ask her whether she saw the freak snowfall the day before, to which Brooke replies that she was riveted by it. Hoping to find out more about the snowfall, Max asks Brooke if she can explain how it happened to a "science noob" like herself. Brooke replies that "even meteorologists can't explain that snow" and says that she bets that Warren can. Brooke then asks Max if she had spoken with Warren yet, to which Max replies that she will. In response, Brooke says, "Lucky you" and then tells Max she is sure Warren will track her down.

Max sees Warren hanging around near the entrance to the girls' dormitory, and he will ask Max out on a movie date to a [Drive-In](drive_in.md) with him.

Upon accepting Warren's invitation, Max will say that she is also a fan of the *Planet of the Apes* movie series. Warren, clearly happy about this, will say, "I have to tell Brooke I'm going with you to the movies instead."

Upon declining Warren's invitation, Max gives the excuse that she can't concentrate on going out to see movies. Warren will be disappointed, but he will accept her response and joke about Max being a "damn dirty human."A reference to the *Planet of the Apes* quote [https://youtu.be/0_m8AmAm-XE?t# 118 "damn dirty ape."] Warren will then say, "I have to see if Brooke wants to go to the drive-in, Max."

Later at Blackwell Academy, Brooke is in the [Science Lab](science_lab.md) with [Michelle Grant](michelle_grant.md) and Warren. If Max looks at Brooke, she will notice that Brooke always seems to pretend as though she's not there and wonders why. If Max approaches her to ask for her advice on a chemistry experiment, Brooke will snidely suggest to Max that Warren only wants her help with his chemistry experiment because he wants an inferior mind to help him.

Brooke will ask Max if she is making "the daily rounds." Max will ask Brooke about her drone, and Brooke will complain that Ms. Grant caught her flying it around the [Blackwell Parking Lot](blackwell_academy_parking_lot.md) and confiscated it as a result of her vendetta against school surveillance cameras. Brooke will make reference that it wasn't as if she was spying on Warren's new car. Max will ask, "You already planted a GPS on him?" Brooke responds with, "I borrowed the one he has on you", before going back to her mobile phone.

Brooke will ask Max if she is making "the daily rounds." Max will say that she is helping Warren out with his science experiment. In a sarcastic tone, Brooke will respond to her with, "Oh. I guess he needed a neophyte assistant so he wouldn't be threatened. But you came to his rescue anyway." Max will say that it's apparently her nature to help. Brooke will be irritated that Warren ignores the experts right in front of him (implying that she is one of these) and wouldn't ask her for her help anyway. If asked further about the subject, Brooke will answer that she's more into robotics than chemistry.

Near the end of the episode, Brooke is standing with most of the other Blackwell Academy students when Kate Marsh makes her suicide attempt from the roof of the dormitory. If Max hesitates to go towards the dormitory, Alyssa can be heard telling Brooke that she cannot believe the situation. Once Max manages to freeze time to head up to the roof to save Kate, Brooke is visible among the crowd with her arms held up and her face turned aside, right at the moment when Kate is about to jump.

## Episode Three - "[Episode 3: Chaos Theory](chaos_theory.md)"

After Kate's death, Brooke will change the message on her room slate together with everyone else at the girls' dormitory. She will replace her visual about "pi" (π) with the words "AVENGE KATE MARSH \Brooke" instead.
|-|Max saved Kate# Max saved Kate
If Max was able to save Kate, Brooke will leave a comment on Max's social media page. The comment is written as follows: "Watching you walk down with Kate was the greatest thing I've ever seen in my life. Thank you." The residents of the girls' dormitory will write messages for Kate on their room slates, and Brooke will replace her visual about "pi" (π) with the words, "WE'LL WAIT FOR KATE! \Brooke".

If [Mark Jefferson](mark_jefferson.md) is suspended from the [Everyday Heroes Photo Contest](everyday_heroes_contest.md), a social media page declaring support for Mr. Jefferson will be created. Brooke will comment on the page with, "Bring back Mr. Jefferson!"

Inside Brooke's locker at the [Blackwell Swimming Pool](blackwell_swimming_pool.md), there is a [Media:Brooke's Drive-In Pamphlet Locker Room.png](small_poster_or_flyer.md) that advertises "The American Drive-In Theatre." If Max looks at it, she will speculate that Brooke wants to go to the drive-in with Warren.
