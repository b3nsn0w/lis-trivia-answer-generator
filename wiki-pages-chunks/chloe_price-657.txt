## Theories 
{{Main|Theories and Speculations (Life is Strange)}}
***Note: These are theories developed prior to the release of Polarized and may not be applicable anymore.***

A likely theory which ties the game together was that Max would need to rewind using the butterfly photo she took in the Blackwell bathroom before Chloe was shot by Nathan. Going back to the beginning of the game, Max would need to let Chloe die in order to correct the timeline and put a halt to the eco-disaster befalling Arcadia Bay. On the other hand, it seemed contradictory that the eco-disaster still exists although Chloe's dying in the alternative timeline.

Another discussed scenario was that Max would step in on this moment and calm Nathan's rage in order to save Chloe and placate Nathan. However, this would be less likely, as Chloe's death is predicted symbolically in the game, and keeping her alive would not correct the wrongs in time; she was originally meant to die.

Another theory was that the cause of the upcoming disastrous tornado was nothing but Chloe's wrath toward her miserable destiny, say, loss of father, loss of friends; considering the moment in "Chrysalis" when at the beacon Max falls into her delusion of the storm right after Chloe cursed Arcadia Bay. It occurs that Chloe could be destructive power against the world and Max's duty is to save the world, and Chloe.
