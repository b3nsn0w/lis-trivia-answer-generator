Here is a section of the wiki page for Episode 5: Polarized - Script:

Lee](danny_lee.md) and I'm with the Berkeley People's Herald. I edit their art section and I totally dig your work. Now, I know the whole "ironic selfie" thing is kind of...played out, but there's something...timeless about your images. So, I—I'd love to set up an appointment or—or interview with you when you get a chance. Uh, here's my card. *[hands Max his business card]* So great talking with you, Max.

**Max:** You too, Danny.

**Comment From Man with Gray Jacket**

**Man:** Bad exposure...bad framing...bad picture. I could've done this so much better.

**Comment From Man with Orange Vest**

**Man:** This makes me feel so sad... Like I was back in high school...

**Optional Conversation with Man in Orange Vest**

**Man:** Usually, these kinda contests, they, uh, they put me to sleep, but I like how this show is about specific actions, you know, not just...abstractions. The Zeitgeist is doin' some unique stuff this year.

**Comment From Woman in Purple Jacket**

**Woman:** I always get so inspired whenever I come here.

**Optional Conversation with Woman in Purple Jacket**

**Woman:** Hey, I love your shot. I just wanted to say congratulations, and I hope you get a lot more attention.

**Comment From Man in Dark Suit**

**Man:** I wonder if I can buy these "Everyday Heroes" pictures...

**Optional Conversation with Man in Dark Suit**

**Man:** Sorry, I don't know your name, but I saw your picture in the gallery brochure and, uh, I just wanted to let you know how cool your entry was.

**Comment From Woman in Green Jacket**

**Woman:** God....I love art.

**Optional Conversation with Woman in Green Jacket**

**Woman:** You must be the Everyday Hero from Blackwell... My name is Lauren Francis and I run the media department at Detroit School of Visual Arts. I'd love to talk about you being a residency next spring... *[inhales]* Don't say anything to Principal Wells... *[scoffs]* Yet.

**Comment From Man in Dark Blue Jacket**

**Man:** How do these galleries afford to rent here?

'''Conversation Between Group By Max's Photo**

**Woman:** It is different... Loving the retro vibe.

**Man:'* Me too. Makes me wanna go buy an instant camera. Damn, I bet that film costs a fortune.

*Max looks at her photo.*

**Woman:** Hey, and there she is to save the day.

**Max:** Hi.

**Max:** *(thinking)'' You did it, Max... You're a real artist. At least...for today...

''Max's nose starts to bleed. She grasps her head in her hands as visions of the storm flash and swirl.*

**Chloe:** *(faintly, echoing)* Max!

*Max awakes from her vision.''

**Max:** Chloe!

**Woman:** Hey, are you okay? We lost you there for a second...

**Man:** Uh, your nose!

**Max:** I'm okay... Uh, jet lag... High altitude...

*Max walks away and the group watches her with concern.*

# ## **Lower Floor** 
*Max sits down on one of the benches, holding her phone.*

**Max:** *[sighs]* You left the ringer off, idiot!

*Max sees that she has 6 missed calls from Chloe. She dials her number and lifts the phone to her ear.*

**Max:** *[sighs]* *(worriedly)* Come on... Please answer...

**Chloe:** *(over phone, scared)* Max! Holy shit, man! Your vision! It's...it's true! Y—you saw the tornado, it's coming!

**Max:** What?! Oh, no... Chloe, where are you?

**Chloe:** *(over phone, scared)* I'm so fucking scared! I'm...I'm by the beach, I—I'm stuck in the t—ah—!

''Chloe's voice cuts off and there is silence on the phone.*

**Max:** *(worriedly)* Chloe! Can you hear me? Hello? Hello?!

*Max puts her phone back in her jacket and gets up.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Oh, my god, *[sighs]* the tornado was real! *[sighs frustratedly]'' Oh, I didn't fix shit! Chloe will die... Arcadia Bay is gonna be destroyed... There has to be a way to stop this...for good!

## **Upper Floor** 
*Max returns to her photo and attempts to focus on it. The longer it takes her to focus, the more people will interrupt her.*

*She is interrupted by a man trying to talk to her.*

**Man:** Excuse me, I'd love to ask you a few questions about your work?

**Max:** Sorry, but...

*Max resumes her focus. She is interrupted again, this time by a woman wearing glasses.*

**Woman:** Oh, you're Max Caulfield, right? Tell me what kind of instant camera you used!

**Max:** Can we talk later? Thanks...

*Max attempts to focus again.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* I literally do not have the time to deal with everybody...

*Another man tries to talk to Max.*

**Man:** Oh, hey... I totally am into your photography.

**Max:** Not right now...

*Max resumes focusing.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Focus, Max! Chloe needs you now!

*A woman interrupts Max.*

**Woman:** Oh, my gosh! *[gasps]* Can I pick your brain for an hour?

**Max:** Thanks, but I—I'm busy...

*Max tries to focus again.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Zen, Max, zen... *[sighs]* There's nobody here but you...nobody...
