Here is a section of the wiki page for Reddit AMA (Dayeanne Hutton):

was fun! The director helped me find their voices by letting me know about the types of characters they were. I knew Alyssa was kinda goth with purple hair, and that Juliet was a bit aggressive lol, we would do all of one characters lines, then switch to the next.
#That's a really amazing question, unfortunately there is always MORE to explore and make more visible in todays world, and I don't pretend to know every issue that needs visibility. I just hope they keep pushing boundaries and showing mainstream media/gaming all that can be accomplished and the positive affect games can have on people.

Hi Day! I love your work as Kate, Alyssa and Juliet, the performances show a great range in your voice acting!

What was the most fun part of playing these characters?

**dayebraham_lincoln**
Hello! Thank you so much! It was honestly just so fun to get to be multiple characters! I didn't know I would be doing that at first!

Hi Daye!
#In what ways are you and Kate alike, and how are you different/opposite?
#Favorite pizza topping? Pineapple on pizza, yes or no?
#How did you manage voicing three different characters?
#What does Hannah Telle smell like?
#Amberprice or Pricefield?
#What do you think will happen to Max and Kate after Arcadia Bay?
#Have you played BtS? Do you think Samantha and Kate would have made good friends?

Thanks!

Hello!

#I think we are both shy and quiet, sensitive, grew up with a lil Catholic guilt, academic. As for differences, I'm not as religious as Kate, and I definitely think I would have fought back in some way to get back at Vortex Club people. But then again, I've never been in that type of situation, so I can't be sure.
#I LOVE plain cheese pizza lol or just fresh mozzarella, sauce and basil. I hated pineapple on pizza as a kid but I honestly haven't tried it since. It might be okay.
#I had help from the wonderful director who told me more about the personalities of the characters and helped get me going in the right direction with their voices.
#Rainbows and smiles
#Pricefield
#I really hope they stay in touch, I think they are both very good for each other!
#I have! Most likely, though I think Kate would be a good friend to anyone thats willing!

Hey Daye! I absolutely love your personality and admire your work, I really enjoy watching your streams too, found out about it from the awesome tea session stream with Hannah several months ago :3.

Your lovely voice really fit nice for Kate as well and I can't imagine her with any other voice. I don't think I have anything to ask you that's unanswered, sorry :)

I just want to say that whatever you're doing, especially your streams are awesome and you should keep it that way. In other notes I'd really like to see a Marshfield tea session DLC, because we didn't even get to get that part, it would be something like the Farewell for BtS I think, but that's highly unlikely to happen at this point :(

Have a nice Daye :)

**dayebraham_lincoln**

Thank you so much!!! I'm so glad you're enjoying the streams as well, thank you for your continued support!

#Usually indie music, I love Sara Bareilles \
#I have a PO box (shown on my twitch bio) and if you send something with a prepaid envelop for me to send it back in, I'm happy to sign!

You have a nice day as well!

What do you think of the fan pairing of gay Kate/Victoria? I always thought the video of Kate likely had a section of the two of them on it, and Victoria thought it was rad and wanted more but Kate -because Jesus- was disgusted. So this made Victoria feel slighted, right? And she tortured Kate because of that.

Thoughts on that theory?

**dayebraham_lincoln**

Ooooh and interesting theory indeed! It's definitely plausible, very true reactions from both characters. Though I'm not sure if I can see Victoria being genuinely interested in Kate. I could see her trying to get with Kate for the purpose of the video and further humiliating her... but honestly I've never thought about it and now I'm curious hahaha

Hey Dayeanne Thank you for doing this Ama. I Love Kate, she is One of my favourite Videogame characters, thanks to your Great perfomance. :)

My question. What was your favourite scene from Season 1 and why?

**dayebraham_lincoln**

Wow, thank you so much! I'm so happy you enjoy Kate so much! I liked the scene in the hospital, because Kate is finally feeling happier and even jokes around a little.
