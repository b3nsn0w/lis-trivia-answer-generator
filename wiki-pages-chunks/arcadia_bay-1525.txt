## Symbolism 
[File:Etinarcadiaego.png](thumb.md)
The name "Arcadia" was deliberately chosen for the symbolism it bears. Arcadia is a utopia introduced in Greek and Latin mythology, which is full of flowers, fruits, and forests. In an interview writer, Christian Divine explained that “it just sounded more peaceful and mystic, and the word ‘Arcadia’ has all these connotations that would be fun to play with and contrast with the darkness that’s actually going on in the town. It has all these different representations and metaphors that you can look in to and work with.”

*"Even in Arcadia, there I am."*
