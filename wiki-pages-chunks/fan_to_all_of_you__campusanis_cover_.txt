##  Lyrics 

[Verse 1]
:To all of you, American girls, it's sad to
:Imagine a world without you
:American girls I'd like to
:Be part of the world around you
:Driving a car by the seaside
:Watching the world from the bright side, yeah

[Verse 2]
:To all of you, American girls in the movies
:No one can tell where your heart is
:American girls like dollies
:With shiny smiles and plastic bodies
:I wish I had an American girlfriend...

[Verse 3]
:I cry sometimes walking around my own place
:Wondering why she cries sometimes
:Talking about her own place
:Somewhere around the mountains
:No one could dry her fountain
:Till she got tired to complain

[Outro]
:That's when I fly to the wildland, to your land
