Here is a section of the wiki page for Chloe Price:

## Clothing # 
In Episode 2, Chloe has a buffalo skull on her shirt. Typically, buffaloes symbolize sacredness, life, gratitude, abundance and great strength. Depending on the tribe, to dream of a buffalo means guiding someone who has fallen on hard times back from the darkness. Considering that Chloe's shirt is portraying only the skull of a buffalo, it's subverting those meanings and, combined with the symbolism of death, rather making it symbolize being lost, giving up and the loss of hope for a better future.

In a part of the final episode, Chloe's wearing a shirt with a picture of the {{Wiki|Ouroboros}}, an ancient symbol depicting a serpent or dragon eating its own tail, on it. It symbolizes the renewal of life or the cycle of life and death; this may tie with the story in which it symbolizes Max constantly reviving Chloe with her rewind powers. It's also meant to signify eternity, continuous renewal, and the soul of the world.For more information on the Ouroboros see here: http://www.tokenrock.com/explain-ouroboros-70.html

There are different theories about the symbolism of Chloe's tri-bullet-necklace. One is that it may represent the three times Chloe is shot during the game (the girls' bathroom in "Chrysalis", Mr. Jefferson in "Dark Room", shooting herself determinantly in the junkyard in "Out of Time"; or maybe without the determinant shot, but the second time we see her getting shot is in the bathroom in the Sacrifice Chloe ending in "Polarized"). It is also interpreted as a representation of the losses of her loved ones she faced -- William who tragically died in an accident; Max who moved away; and Rachel who disappeared.

## Tattoo Symbolism

Chloe's tattoo displays blue butterflies (plus chrysalis and some newly born butterflies), a worn out red ribbon, a golden skull, thorns and red tropical flowers which appear to be Hibiscus flowers.

Tropical flower tattoos are appropriate for both men and women. The symbolic meaning of a Hibiscus tattoo is delicate beauty or consumed by love.

## Spirit Animal

On one hand, the [Blue Butterfly](blue_butterfly.md) that appears before the moment of her death in Chrysalis is deeply connected to Chloe's character. The butterfly is the symbol of transformation, a person identified with this spirit animal can bring joy and bliss, they are lively, bright and go through various personal transformations, it may be a symbol to indicate you to lighten up and add color to your life. This resembles a lot Chloe's character who has gone through many personal changes. Even with a gun on her face she noted the butterfly at the beginning of the game. It's also a symbol of soul and immortality, which fits to Max constantly saving her. Furthermore, the color blue is associated with both the butterfly and Chloe.In the [Director's Commentary](director_s_commentary.md), it has been said that there is a lot of symbolism behind the butterfly and the fact that Chloe has got some butterflies on her tattoo. Chloe's hair color was confirmed to be based on the blue butterfly. There is also a poster of a blue butterfly in Alternative Chloe's empty room, as well as butterflies as part of the pattern of Chloe's boots. The only entry in Max's [Max's Nightmare Journal](nightmare_journal.md) features a drawing of a butterfly with Chloe's head, further foreshadowing the final choice. The texture file of that drawing is named *Spirit_animal_Chloe*, which reinforces the theory of the butterfly being Chloe's spirit animal. In the Sacrifice Chloe ending, a blue butterfly is landing on Chloe's coffin.

On the other hand, there is also a strong symbolism associated with her spirit animal being the [Blue Jay](blue_jay.md). The Native American roots of the blue jay spirit animal is vast and involves an ancient character named blue jay who is ultimately good-natured and wants to help humanity, but cannot help but specialize in being mischievous. This is highly associated with Chloe's personality.Blue jay also travels to the land of the dead frequently, which makes sense as Chloe frequently dies, and is heavily associated with death colors and motifs. Blue jay is finally at peace with his death, appreciating the world of the dead only after he is finally gone. This could be symbolic of the end to Chloe's emotional suffering after her death, and possibly the end of her physical suffering in the alternative timeline. (This could also be a hint to the theory that Chloe is actually meant to die, disregarding Max's constantly saving her.)The blue jay in the game frequently dies, and Max is given the task of saving it. In Joyce's bedroom in Chrysalis, downstairs in the Madsen household in Chaos Theory, and again in Dark Room, we find a blue jay and are given the option to save it or not. This is hugely symbolic of Max's constant choice of whether to save or abandon Chloe.

## Name Meaning 
The name Chloe derives from the Greek mythology as an alternate name of the goddess of agriculture and fertility, the springs and animals, {{Wiki|Demeter}}, and refers to the young, green foliage or shoots of plants. Demeter was especially worshiped for her power over air and water from historical times in {{Wiki|Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia}}, a utopian unspoiled, harmonious wilderness, which is believed to be the mythological basis for the town of [Arcadia Bay](arcadia_bay.md). Some have speculated that Demeter being worshipped for her power over air and water may also connect to the theory that the storm is a manifestation of Chloe’s wrath and anger toward her circumstances in life, with her father’s death, her best friend’s abandonment, and Rachel’s sudden disappearance. Demeter also presided over the sacred law, and the cycle of life and death, which may refer to Chloe's connection to death and her constant reviving by Max. She was known as the “goddess of the blessed afterlife”, which could tie in with connection to the spirit animal world. Chloe is a springtime name symbolizing new growth, though by no means as fresh as it once was, which refers to Chloe's character development in numerous ways. It also is a Biblical name mentioned in the New Testament.

Chloe's surname, Price, can refer to her life literally being the price that Max has to pay for using her powers, even if she uses them to save other people's lives. However, should Max choose to sacrifice Arcadia Bay to save Chloe, she becomes her "prize" as she gains Chloe's friendship and love for the rest of her life.
