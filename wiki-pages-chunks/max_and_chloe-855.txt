## Notes 

*, *{{Wiki|Power Rangers}}*, *{{Wiki|Blue's Clues}}* and *{{Wiki|Teletubbies}}'', and they had movie nights and played video games together. They had a tree fort, the location of which Chloe [Media:Note-lighthouse-map.png](marked.md) on the orientation map of [Arcadia Bay](arcadia_bay.md) at the [lighthouse](lighthouse.md) so they would "always be able to find each other in case of emergency." The girls also seem to tag locations where they shared games and adventures, proven by the tree stump engraving at the lighthouse.

In 1999, Chloe's parents bought her a kitten named [Bongo](bongo.md), which would later become part of Max and Chloe's "superhero adventure" drawings. After he got killed by a car, Chloe and Max made a gravestone for him located in Chloe's backyard. Also in the backyard of Chloe's house, there is a swing which Max and Chloe would take turns on when they were little. Chloe liked to fly way up into the air, while Max was scared and always jumped off before falling.Max remembers this if she uses the swing in "[Episode 3: Chaos Theory](chaos_theory.md)". There is also a wooden board decorated by the two girls, although the drawing is now barely visible. This board is later used to sort out the clues in Max and Chloe's investigation on the [:Category:Dark Room Conspiracy](dark_room_conspiracy.md).

In 2008, the girls were having secret "wine-tasting sessions" at Chloe's house, one of which is remembered by Max when she visits Chloe's house for the first time in five years. The wine spilt on the carpet in the dining room had left a stain which couldn't be washed out and remains visible to the present day. (It is likely that this stain was what gave their wine tasting activities away to Chloe's parents.)

At some point in 2008, Max and Chloe were making pancakes together with William at Chloe's house when [Joyce Price](chloe_s_mom.md) called and asked William to pick her up from the [Sav-Mart](grocery_store.md), which led to William's death in a car accident. Although Max was supportive at the time, she soon moved to Seattle with her [:Category:Caulfield Family](parents.md), leaving her best friend and her old life behind. The two fell out of touch until Max's return to Arcadia Bay five years later.Â
