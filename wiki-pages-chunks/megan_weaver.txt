Here is a section of the wiki page for Megan Weaver:

#  Megan Weaver 

**Megan Weaver** was [Chloe Price](chloe_price.md)'s close friend in the [Alternative Timeline (Life is Strange)](alternative_timeline.md). She and Chloe spent a lot of time together after [Maxine Caulfield](max.md) left for [Seattle](seattle.md).

She also wrote a postcard to Chloe after her accident, sending her apologies, which proves their close relationship:

{{Bigquote
|Dear Chloe, I am so sorry

for what happened. Know

that I am here for you if

you need anything. I hope

you feel better and I hope
to see you again.

xoxo Megan
}}

The two became more distant afterwards, Chloe feeling abandoned by her, commenting that after the accident Megan was "too cool for school".

In the [timeline](original_timeline.md), the name "Megan" appears on one of the red folders in the [Dark Room (Location)](prescott_bunker.md), which implies that Megan was a [Dark Room Victims](victim.md) of the [:Category:Dark Room Conspiracy](dark_room_conspiracy.md). During the [Square_Enix_Extra_Life_Livestream_(November_2015)](extra_life_stream.md), it was confirmed that both Megans refer to the same person.

If the same is true in the [Alternative Timeline (Life is Strange)](alternative_timeline.md), it could be a contributing factor towards her stopping attending school and abandoning Chloe after her accident.
