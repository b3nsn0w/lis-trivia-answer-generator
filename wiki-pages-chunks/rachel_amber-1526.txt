Here is a section of the wiki page for Rachel Amber:

## Episode Two - "[Episode 2: Out of Time](out_of_time.md)" 
In this episode, Max visits the bathroom on her way to get ready for breakfast with Chloe. There, we can see graffiti bearing the slogan "Rachel Amber is a whore" implying people thought she was sexually reckless. In the bathroom of the [Two Whales Diner](two_whales_diner.md), the same can be said with the graffiti, as "Rachel A owes me a BJ" can be seen on the wall of one of the cubicles.

Later in the episode, Max has the option to explore Chloe and Rachel's hideout in the American Rust Junkyard where she can discover a lot of mementos of Chloe's friendship with Rachel. She can also find a crumpled letter that reads as follows:

You can tell how much I want you to read this letter since I've been dragging my ass to give it to you. Maybe I just want you to find it when I'm not around so we never have to talk about it. And I don't want you to hate me. Where to start? 

I met somebody recently who's so different from the lame Vortex Club snobs. I know you'll have a meltdown when I tell you and think he's gross, but I swear he's wise and unconventional. Kind of scary, not in a "bad boy" way. He's just experienced some serious shit. Yes, I'm kinda obssessed (sic). I won't blame you for freaking.

Maybe I know you're right and this just has to be my secret. 

I hate not sharing this with you except I know you'd give me that stink eye and grill me for every stupid detail. If I even told you thatThe word "just" has been added as an insert here, like an afterthought by Rachel. However, this word is not included in the screen text when the letter is read. last night we hooked up near campus

As Max turns the corner towards the grassy area, presumed Rachel's spirit animal appears - the [doe](doe.md). Stand still, and you can see where it originates; a particular spot Max and Chloe will occupy in Episode 4.

Chloe and Rachel's bond is emphasized here in their special place. Rachel is more girly than Chloe, evident from the makeup left there. A drawing on the wall of Rachel with a dog, presumed to be [Pompidou](pompidou.md), reveals that she had a connection with Frank Bowers. We can tell that Rachel was in a secret relationship she did not want to confide in Chloe about, because of a scribbled out note she left in the trash there.It is possible this relationship is with either Frank Bowers or Mark Jefferson. The former is more likely, due to the pictures Frank has of her later in the game, as well as the confirmation that she had a relationship with Frank.  Max can also find friendship bracelets and funny photos of both of them, proving their deep friendship.

## Episode Three - "[Episode 3: Chaos Theory](chaos_theory.md)" 
[File:Tumblr inline nqklmnrIDM1tv1bk8 540.jpg](thumb.md)
When searching through files in [Raymond Wells](principal_wells.md)' office, Max and Chloe come across a file on Rachel. When searching the file on the computer of Nathan Prescott, they look at a highly disturbing picture that Nathan drew that says "Rachel in the Dark Room", hinting that Rachel is trapped somewhere and Nathan is somehow connected to her disappearance. They also find files connecting Rachel to Nathan Prescott and David Madsen, who accused her of drug dealing.

Chloe mentions Rachel while she and Max swim in the [Blackwell Swimming Pool](blackwell_swimming_pool.md), stating that she would love being in there.

When approaching Nathan in the Two Whales Diner after his suspension, he initially mistakes Max as Rachel Amber by exclaiming Rachel's name in excitement as he looks up at Max, implying that he and Rachel were friendly. If asked about Rachel and Frank, he will say that she partied more than him, and she was a "fiend on her own". He accidentally lets it slip that Frank made a "blood oath" with Rachel, but tells Max not to let anyone know he said anything. If Max rewinds, she can use the information about the blood oath against Nathan, throwing him off guard. Panicked, Nathan reveals that Frank believed Rachel was in love with him when Nathan believed all she wanted was his drugs and used Frank taking pictures of her to facilitate her drug habit. Rachel thought Frank was a liar and loser, like most in Arcadia Bay.

While Max is going through Frank's trailer, she finds pictures of Rachel with Frank, Rachel posing sexually, and Rachel cuddling with Pompidou. Max also finds love letters from Rachel to Frank. It is made clear that the two had a relationship, and that they were close. Frank keeps a picture of her in his wallet and clearly misses her as much as Chloe does. When Max tells Chloe about this, she feels betrayed and states that Rachel had lied to her.

## Episode Four - "[Episode 4: Dark Room](dark_room.md)" 
When talking with Frank about finding Rachel, he seems upset and shouts at the girls, accepting that she is gone. He also mentions that he knew her better than both Max and Chloe ever did. Max can use this information in order to persuade him to give her and Chloe the details for his account book.

Later, Max and Chloe explore the "[Dark Room (Location)](dark_room.md)", a survival bunker under the [Prescott Barn](prescott_barn.md). They discover incriminating sexual pictures of Rachel, taken while she was drugged. There are several shots, one of which Max notices is different, as Rachel seems "awake and furious"; this makes it clear that the photos are not consensual, despite Chloe insisting that she posed for them.

Chloe becomes upset, saying she recognizes the spot in the photo of Rachel and Nathan. The two girls then head to the junkyard to investigate. Chloe begins digging, and the pair uncovers Rachel's body, at exactly the same place where the doe had originated before in Episode 2. They recoil from the smell, implying that she had been dead for a long period of time and Chloe is devastated to find this out. They revisit the spot later in the episode to confirm that her body is still there.

## Episode Five - "[Episode 5: Polarized](polarized.md)" 
Jefferson reveals that Rachel was in love with him and that she loved having pictures taken of her. He also reveals that Nathan accidentally killed Rachel with an overdose whilst trying to impress Jefferson (whom he saw as a father-figure) by taking pictures of her drugged (as Mr. Jefferson does for his famous artwork).

Chloe also refers to the tornado terrorizing Arcadia Bay as "Rachel's revenge".
