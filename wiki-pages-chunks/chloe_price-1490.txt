Here is a section of the wiki page for Chloe Price:

## Personality 
Chloe is a stubborn, mischievous, and rebellious teenage girl. She is the archetypal punk-rocker, expressed in both her music taste and style. She loves to get high, drink beer, and can be described as bold and outgoing. She has a big mouth often making snarky comments, acts fearless and loves to take risks, which often gets her in trouble. She can be prone to angry outbursts, and has serious issues with abandonment and trust after her father's death, Max's move to Seattle, and the disappearance of Rachel Amber. Due to all her bad experience over the years, she has become pessimistic and resentful of life, convinced that there wasn't really anyone who actually cared about her or who she could trust inThere is a writing on her wall that says, "EVERYBODY LIES NO EXCEPTIONS"."Everybody cares until they don't.".

She sometimes is very insensitive to other people's feelings, and may act selfish and possessive, always wanting her loved ones' attention for herself and getting jealous and resentful if they don't spare their time for her or don't act her way. She can also be very irrational and irresponsible, which often takes the form of blaming others for situations out of their control and avoiding any responsibility of damage caused by herself (i.e, when she says to Max that if she doesn't blame someone else, it's her fault), which even takes the extent of blaming her dead father for her misery; but she will in some instances eventually acknowledge when she was in the wrong and apologize. Nonetheless, Max is aware of Chloe's flaws but still cherishes her highly and considers her a "good friend who shows up when you need her". Chloe also is a very protective, devoted and faithful companion, though she tends to get too attached and obsessive. She is pretty straightforward with her (romantic) feelings for other people, and also very flirtatious and teasing. Despite her rough outward appearance, Chloe is actually a very insecure and anxious person, and her tough acting may be nothing more than a facade she built up to protect herself from further harm.

Chloe very likely has to deal with depressionThere are anti-depressants ({{Wiki|Fluoxetine}} aka. Prozac 10mg) in the bathroom of the [Madsen Household](madsen_household.md), but it's also possible that they're Joyce's since they are still there in the alternative timeline. caused by her experience of loss and abandonment, and it's implied that she suffers from insomniaThere is a graffiti above Chloe's bed that says, "I CAN'T SLEEP". and even had suicidal thoughts prior to Max's returnThere is a crumpled-up note you can find in Chloe's secret [hideout](hideout.md) in the junkyard which says, "I WANT TO DIE". There also is a piece of graffiti on the [Blackwell Academy](blackwell_academy.md) fountain in Chloe's hand writing which says, "Please go ahead and kill me.". It's possible that her line "Rachel saved my life" literally refers to her preventing Chloe from committing suicide.

She appears to show symptoms of a condition called {{Wiki|Borderline personality disorder|Borderline Personality Disorder}}, as characterized by her trust and abandonment issues.See here to find out more about the symptoms of BPD: http://psychcentral.com/disorders/borderline-personality-disorder-symptoms/ During a conversation with Max in "Chaos Theory",[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v# 76D2D05pqj4 Click here] to listen to the audio Chloe is shown having a meltdown and expressing typical fears of someone who has BPD.When asked on Twitter about Chloe's behavior, Co-Director Michel Koch said he "never considered to affirm either BPD or depression, to not stigmatize anyone and to focus on other topics."[https://twitter.com/DONTNOD_Michel/status/944177879658762240 Twitter post by Michel Koch]

Chloe often drinks alcohol and smokes as a form of self-medication. She has had problems with drug addiction in the past, evident from her stepfather's comment about weed being a big deal for her, as well as her large debt with the drug dealer [Frank Bowers](frank_bowers.md). Although Chloe was smart enough for [Blackwell Academy](blackwell_academy.md), which is evident from the [Alternative Timeline (Life is Strange) (Life is Strange)](alternative_timeline.md) Chloe's school report, she abandoned her studies. All these self-destructive character traits of Chloe, including her rebellion against authorities and her family, her drug abuse, her "boy toy phase" and the loss of control about her own life, which becomes apparent in her chaotic lifestyle and her lack of scholastic and occupational ambition as well as her refusal of responsibility, can be linked to her depression, representing Chloe's way to deal with her desperation, to fill her inner void and to ease her pain. Also, her lack of sensitivity can be tied to her experience of loss and abandonment and her consequent depression.

During her time with Max, Chloe's personality seems to grow a lot, since she finds new strength in Max's support and the resurgence of their friendship. Although Chloe may not seem like that on the outside as it is hard for her to show those traits, as their story proceeds, she appears able to show a more caring and brave side to her. At the end of the game, Chloe admits her selfishness towards her family over all the years and even offers to sacrifice herself to save the town from destruction.
