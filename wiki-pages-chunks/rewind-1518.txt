Here is a section of the wiki page for Rewind:

#  Rewind 

[File:Max power.png](thumb.md).]]
**Rewinding** is one of the major gameplay elements in *[Life is Strange](life_is_strange.md)*. It gives the player the [Max's Abilities](ability.md) to Rewind Time through [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md), undoing any of her actions, and provides replay value to the game. It emphasizes the overall theme of cause and effect as well as the {{wiki|butterfly effect}}.

After observing a new element of gameplay information, such as examining an object or having a particular conversation which gives Max new insight, the player can rewind in order to use that information to Max's advantage in the game.

It can make her seem knowledgeable in front of her teachers and or less nosy in front of her friends and other people. This element of gameplay can influence the player's experience enormously.
: *The butterfly icon in the top left corner of the screen is shown to indicate that Max has made an influencing decision which furthers the gameplay; this also indicates that those choices can be changed.*[File:This action will have consequences-0.png](thumb.md)

## Mechanic 
[File:Rewind Swirl.png](left.md)
The rewind position is indicated by the swirl in the top left-hand corner. It dictates any notable events which have taken place - such as a conversation or interaction with an object - which Max has the ability to rewind. Using this, the player can see when they made decisions which can be changed within the game environment.

A recent conversation, for example, will appear as a dot on the swirl. To go back to the moment before this conversation occurred, the player must rewind to the dot. It is then possible to repeat the same conversation and make different choices.
