Here is a section of the wiki page for Young Max and Chloe:

## Max # 
* **Racing up and down the lighthouse steps –** Young Max enjoyed racing up and down the steps of Arcadia Bay's lighthouse when it used to be open to the public. It is unknown if she enjoyed this activity with Chloe, but it seems likely.Max: "Too bad it's locked... I remember racing up and down the steps..." (Episode 1 - lighthouse at the cliff.)
* **Making a CD –** When Max was 12 years of age, she made a pirate mix CD for Chloe.Max: "Oh my God, I made that mix for her when we were twelve." (Episode 4 - Alternative Timeline, Chloe's garage bedroom.)Max and Chloe were never the same age at the same time due to their birth dates. However, it is likely that Max meant that she made this CD when she was 12 and Chloe was 13, as Max mentions previously in her journal that her and Chloe last hung out when they were 13. Again, this mutual age is impossible, but we know that Max left Chloe when she was 13 and Chloe was 14.
***Seafood –** Max enjoys seafood, which makes sense as Arcadia Bay had a thriving fishing industry when she was younger. The place she enjoyed eating seafood at was called [Pacific Steve's Famous Crab](pacific_steve_s_famous_crab.md)."No way... I totally remember going there when I was a kid. I loved the {{wiki|hushpuppy|hushpuppies}}. Now the sign is just Arcadia Bay junk..." (Episode 2 - ''Pacific Steve's Famous Crab'' sign discarded in the junkyard.)
***Pancakes –** It is unknown if Chloe enjoyed pancakes as much as Max did, but what is known is that Max could eat lots of pancakes.Max: "I'm dying for some of your famous pancakes." . . . Joyce: "I thought you would have missed those. You ate more than William, and he loved them..." . . . Max: "I remember. We would race each other to grab them from the stack."
***Making an Effort –** It is suggested that Max was the kind of person to make an effort with stationary and letters.Chloe: "And you even wrote on that cool parchment paper. That's so Max." (Episode 4 - Alternative Timeline, Beach.)
***Being Tidy –** Max doesn't class herself as a rebel and has an ingrained sense of pride in keeping her bed neat and tidy, which she has picked up from her mother.Max: "I am so not a rebel. I always like my bed to be neat and tidy. Thanks, Mom." (Episode 2 - Max's dorm room.) However, when given her freedom and independence from home, she does display an urge to rebel against this sense of order, although it is unlikely that she could keep this up for long due to it seemingly going against her nature.Max: "This totally reminds me of being a kid in my room. Sorry Mom, I can make my bed whenever I want. Boo yah!" (Episode 2 - Max's dorm room.)
***Peanut Butter Preference –** It is suggested that Max prefers smooth peanut butter and possibly dislikes the crunchy variety altogether.Max: "I'm glad that's creamy, and not crunchy..." (Episode 3 - Chloe's living room.)
* **Journal Entries –** Max kept a journal even in her childhood. She would write entries about which anime character she wanted to be, about her dreams of being a famous photographer, and what she and Chloe would be doing when they are older. Max: "I remember when my journal entries were about which anime character I wanted to be. Or my dreams of being a respected globe-hopping photographer. Or what me and Chloe would be doing when we were finally adults... at least we know how that turned out so far." (Episode 3 - *Journal*.)

(Episode 3 - magazine on table, Chloe's house, 2008.)
* **Skateboarding –** Chloe seemed to be very good at skateboarding.Max: "It's cool that in this reality, Chloe really loves skating too." (Episode 3 - Alternative Timeline, magazine.)

(Episode 1 - [Blackwell Campus](blackwell_campus.md).)

## Times of Mischief 
* **Attempted TPing –** One activity of mischief that the two girls got up to was their plan to TP a neighbor's house, but they both chickened out and ran back home, laughing about it."It reminded me of the time we were going to TP one of the neighbor's houses and we even snuck out but got chicken and ran back home, laughing all the way..." (Episode 3 - *Journal*.)

Life was simple..."(Episode 3 - *Journal*.), including on Chloe's parents!Chloe: "Oh my God, we covered everything in flour, even my parents." (Episode 4 - Alternative Timeline, Chloe's garage bedroom.)
