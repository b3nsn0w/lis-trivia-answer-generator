Here is a section of the wiki page for Easter Eggs (Life is Strange):

## Groundhog Day 
*When looking at the window in Jefferson's classroom after rewinding for the first time in Episode 1, Max says she feels like she's in *{{Wiki|Groundhog_Day_(film)|Groundhog Day}}*, a comedy movie about a man who is caught in a time loop and has to experience the same day again and again. Max also comments that her situation despite the resemblance to the film isn't funny refering to it being a comedy piece.
* After warning [Alyssa Anderson](alyssa_anderson.md) about the toilet paper in the hall of the girls’ dormitory in Episode 2, she asks Max what her favorite science-fiction film is. The player has the choice of choosing *Groundhog Day* among other time travel movies.
* In the parking lot of the [Two Whales Diner](two_whales_diner.md) in Episode 2, there is a [Media:Licence Plate Reference (EP2)-07.jpg](license_plate.md) that spells "GRNDHGD".
* Max mentions that the jukebox in the diner is playing “I Got You Babe”. She finds it ironic, given the similarities between her own story and the film *Groundhog Day* that featured that song prominently.

## Trivia 
*In an interview, Game Designer [Alejandro Arque](alejandro_arque.md) said that his favorite Easter eggs are the *Harry Potter* and *Doctor Who* references.[source missing]
**In other media:*
**In Dontnod's other episodic game *{{wiki|Tell_Me_Why_(video_game)|Tell Me Why}}* (released in 2020), *Life is Strange* (Life is Strange) is one of three games referenced in the second episode through the achievement "Remember Strange Vampyr." The title references Dontnod games in release order - *Remember Me*, *Life is Strange*, and *Vampyr* - and is activated by looking at three posters that relate to these games inside the Veni Vidi Vecchi General Store. The poster for *Life is Strange* is located on the wall behind Michael Abila and features a polaroid camera very similar to [Max's Camera](max_s.md) and a [Blue Butterfly](blue_butterfly.md). If Tyler inspects the poster, he will ask Michael if he remembers the ad for it and what the slogan was. Michael will reply that it was "something poetic about time travel and life being weird."
***13 WOOD ST* contains a Steam Achievement "Easter Egg (1)https://steamcommunity.com/stats/1727990/achievements - Strange ..." that is unlocked when the player looks at a picture of a [Blue Butterfly](blue_butterfly.md).
