Here is a section of the wiki page for Episode 2: Out of Time - Summary:

Graham](warren_graham.md). They have a conversation regarding David Madsen, and Max thanks him for stepping in yesterday when Nathan manhandled her on the [Blackwell Parking Lot](parking_lot.md). Warren asks Max if she wants to go see a *Planet of the Apes* movie with him. After deciding whether to accept or decline, Max takes the bus downtown to the [Two Whales Diner](diner.md) where [Chloe Price](chloe_price.md)'s mother, [Joyce Price](joyce_price.md), works as a waitress. There is a [R.J. MacReady](fisherman.md) outside with pamphlets on a table and other local residents (which includes a [Truck Driver](trucker.md), a police officer named [Anderson Berry](anderson_berry.md), an [Old Guy](old_guy.md), and a [Homeless Lady](homeless_woman.md)) that Max can chat to nearby. After entering the diner, Max sees [Trevor Yard](trevor.md) and [Justin Williams](justin.md) from Blackwell sitting at a table near the door. Max sits at a table further down. Joyce sees Max and converses with her regarding Chloe, [William Price](william_price.md)'s death, David, and the events of the previous night. The conversation will depend on Max's previous choices and involvement.

Max decides what to order and Joyce walks away, returning shortly with food. Chloe enters the diner and gets moaned at by her mother before sitting with Max. Chloe is still a bit skeptical regarding Max's rewind powers, so Max uses them to convince her. Chloe wants Max to tell her the contents of her pockets. After this is successful, Max tells Chloe she will predict the future by telling her four of the events that will unfold in the next 30 seconds. Impressed, Chloe wants to further test and "play" with Max's power, so she asks Max to come with her to one of her secret lairs. Max's nose suddenly starts bleeding, which she puts down to too much excitement from hanging out with Chloe again. Just before leaving the diner, Max gets a phone call from Kate Marsh. Chloe gets offended that somebody else wants Max's attention. Should Max answer it and risk irritating Chloe or ignore it and hurt Kate even further?

Chloe and Max end up at the [American Rust Junkyard](junkyard.md), Chloe's "secret lair", where Chloe and [Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md) used to hang out together. Chloe has the gun that she took from David and wants to shoot targets with Max's help. She asks Max to find some bottles to use as targets. Although three are easy to obtain, the last two require using a plank and a wooden crate to reach. Chloe wants to take out all of the bottles without wasting a single bullet, so Max has to rewind in order to guide her aim. After doing this, she has Max direct her into shooting at various objects (a blue plank, an old metal barrel, some computer monitors, and a wheel rim) and parts of an old car (the windshield; the car bumper, which will cause Chloe to accidentally shoot herself; the gas tank; and the front tire).Â Max's nose starts bleeding again, and she collapses while having another vision of the [lighthouse](lighthouse.md) and the [The Storm](tornado.md). After Max comes around, Chloe wants to show her how to shoot the gun and puts it in Max's hands. She quickly hides the gun behind her back as [Frank Bowers](frank_bowers.md) shows up to demand money from Chloe. Chloe notices that Frank is wearing a bracelet that belonged to Rachel. She angrily confronts him and demands to know where he got it, to which he replies that a "friend" gave it to him. Chloe, believing that he stole it from Rachel, tries to take the bracelet, but Frank pulls a knife on her. Without thinking, Max points the gun at Frank (unaware that it is empty). It's up to her to shoot or not shoot, which will either anger or amuse Frank (who will take the gun if Max doesn't shoot) and impress or disappoint Chloe. Afterwards, Frank leaves, insisting that Chloe pays him by Friday or else.

Chloe and Max leave the junkyard to take a walk along the [Train Tracks](train_tracks.md). They decide to take a break and lie down on the train tracks to recover from recent events and just talk. Max has another vision. She hears Chloe shouting her name inside the vision and comes to, only to discover that Chloe has a foot stuck in the tracks. They hear the train coming, and it's up to Max to save Chloe. If the train gets too close, Max can rewind to buy herself more time. Max finds a crowbar that she can use to either topple the cable roll and free Chloe (damaging the train tracks) or to force open the door to the station room to get pliers from the drawer, which she can then use to cut the red wire in the panel box and then pull the track switch to free Chloe without damaging the tracks. Afterwards, Max decides she had better get back to school and Chloe gives her a ride. As they pull up outside Blackwell, Chloe tells Max her theory that the storm and Max's powers are connected somehow, which gives Max something to think about.

Once inside the school, Max finds herself with some extra time to look around. She runs into David in the corridor, who wants to talk about Chloe and what happened the night before. After the conversation, Max gets a text from Warren who is in the [Science Lab](science_lab.md). Max makes her way there to assist him with a chemical experiment. She can also speak to Brooke in the lab and to Zachary in the hallway. As she leaves the science lab and makes her way to the [Art Classroom](art_room.md), she runs into [Mark Jefferson](mr__jefferson.md) having a dispute with Kate, who eventually walks away from him crying. Max has a brief conversation with Mr. Jefferson, which is interrupted by a phone call he receives. He asks Max to go and
