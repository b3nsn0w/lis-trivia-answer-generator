Here is a section of the wiki page for Episode 2: Out of Time - Script:

this investigation from there.

**Max (thinking):** *My head is killing me, but I think I can use my power again.*

*Max signs the statement.*

**Principal Wells:** Well, I think we know less now than when we started. We'll be assisting the police with further inquiries. I know this has been a stressful day... I wish I had the power to change it all for the better... So, thank you for coming in.

*Everyone but Principal Wells leaves the office.*

# ## **Main Campus - With Warren** 
*Max and Warren sit together on the Main Campus at sunset.*

Saved KateSaved Kate**Max:** I couldn't even believe it was happening. It was literally slow motion as I grabbed her hand...and then I could feel her grabbing mine...

**Warren:** Max, that was the greatest thing I've ever seen! Ever! You reached out, she reached out...hugs, tears, applause! Like a superhero!

**Max:** Not quite. Look at me, I'm a mess.

**Warren:** You're glowing. Seriously! A human halo. I'm pretty sure you earned your wings today.

**Max:** I'm still worried about Kate. She did try to kill herself. All over a video...

**Warren:** "Viral" is the right word. Like a disease.

**Max:** So, you watched it?

**Warren:** Just one...and a half times...

|-|Couldn't save Kate# Couldn't save Kate**Max:** I just...can't believe it. It's like it wasn't even real...watching her drop like a weight... I really thought I could save her...like a superhero...

**Warren:** Come on, Max. Do not for a second blame yourself. Kate was on that roof for her reasons, not yours.

**Max:** My hand just reached out...

**Warren:** Stop it. You were the only one with balls enough to run to the roof. You were the only one who cared.

**Max:** Yeah, I sure made a big fucking difference. Maybe if more people cared...better people than me...

**Warren:** You're the best person around...

**Max:** Warren, I screwed up today.

**Warren:** That makes no logical sense.

**Max:** Warren, I don't mean to sound weird, but there's something ominous going on at Blackwell...

**Warren:** Today proves that.

**Max:** And I'm working on proof that Kate Marsh is connected to Rachel Amber...somehow. Along with Nathan and Mr. Madsen.

**Warren:** I'm not a big conspiracy guy, but I wouldn't doubt it. Nathan did scare me yesterday and Madsen is a straight-up dickhead. So...what do you think is really happening?

**Max:** What the hell is this...?

*Max and Warren look at the sky, where the setting sun is suddenly eclipsed.*

**Max:** The weather confirms this weird day... Feel that chill...

**Warren:** Max, there was no eclipse scheduled today... I would know. I would.

*Max rubs her arms, feeling cold. Warren moves closer and wraps his arms around her.*

**Max:** I believe you, Warren... I'll believe anything this week...

**Chloe (SMS):** This eclipse freaks me out...

**Max (SMS):** Let's find out what's going on!

**Max (SMS):** Together!

*A row of red binders are shown. The binders have various female names written on them. The last one in the row says "RACHEL." Another binder, labeled "KATE," lies on a table. Next to it is a photograph of Kate on a piece of paper with writing all over it. Other than the name "Kate Marsh," the writing on this paper is illegible. A pen, X-ACTO knife, tube of glue, two containers of prescription pills, and a half-full glass of alcohol are also placed on the table.*
