Here is a section of the wiki page for Max and Chloe:

## Romantic Instances 
* At the Two Whales Diner in Episode 2, Chloe jokes about the sexual advantages of Max's proven rewind abilities, adding, "Maybe you made a move on me and I would never know!" Towards the end of this episode, if Max tries to shoot Frank, Chloe will text Max in Jefferson's class, proposing to marry her. Max replies that it is "illegal in Oregon... for now," to which Chloe replies they can elope.
* Chloe becomes quite playful and more relaxed toward Max in [Episode 3: Chaos Theory](episode_3.md) - presumably an effect of Max's calming influence on her. When they are trying break into the principal's office, Max makes a phone call to Warren for some assistance, but as soon as she replies to Warren's movie night invitation, Chloe stops lock picking to look in Max's direction before losing her temper with the door in what seems like a small fit of jealousy. When inside the principal's office, if Chloe is allowed to take the money she finds in a desk drawer, she excitedly invites Max on a road trip to Portland with the leftover cash, suggesting strip clubs as a destination. She then says she is kidding about the strip clubs before adding an afterthought of, "you never know..." Once outside the principal's office, Chloe wears an impish look on her face and invites Max for a "midnight swim" in the pool. Once Chloe is in the pool and urging Max to join her, she glances away momentarily as Max gets undressed down to her underwear.Fans have speculated a few things about this glance, such as Chloe experiencing a moment of attraction or shyness, or reluctantly looking away to give an awkward Max some privacy. Another speculation is that she may have felt a brief pang of guilt over sharing this moment with Max when she still misses Rachel.
* The morning after the midnight swim, Chloe dares Max to kiss her, and Max has the option to accept or refuse. If Max does kiss her, she will "forbid" Max from rewinding and taking the kiss back, claiming Max knows she is hotter than any of those Seattle "Artholes." Max will think the kiss was priceless. If Max refuses to kiss her, claiming she is not that easy, Chloe will reply in kind before telling Max to just admit she already "macked" on her before rewinding like it never happened. Max will love Chloe's fearlessness. Chloe may also state she doesn't believe anyone is good enough to be with Max except for her.
* The [Easily Missed Details (Life is Strange)#Chloe.27s_Phone_Background](lock_screen.md) of Chloe's phone in Episode 3 has an effect on Max. If, up to this point, Max has made choices that please Chloe, the lock screen will display a picture of Max. Max believes this means she has proven herself worthy again.
* Later in this episode, when Max and Chloe gain access to Frank's RV, Chloe sits herself in the driver's seat and excitedly asks Max if she can see them both heading down the coast in it. Seemingly out of nowhere, Max brings up the earlier kiss dare as though it's still on her mind. If she had kissed Chloe earlier, she tells Chloe that she would probably want Max to kiss her again on this road trip. If she had refused to kiss Chloe, she tells Chloe she would probably dare her to drive the RV like she dared Max to kiss her. There's no response from Chloe to either comment, and Max changes the subject, saying they are on a schedule to look for clues. Chloe replies that she was "just daydreaming."
* In [Episode 4: Dark Room](episode_4__dark_room.md), after returning to the original timeline, Max will state in her journal: "The second I saw her blue hair and that beautiful pissed off face I wanted to kiss her again", or state that she regrets not kissing Chloe when she had the chance.
* Also in Episode 4, when Chloe and Max speak with Mark Jefferson on campus, Max seems to stumble over her introduction of Chloe, hesitating slightly before referring to Chloe as her friend. Later, in the same conversation, Chloe refers to herself as Max's date to the End of the World Party.
* Depending on the choices before this point, at the end of [Episode 5: Polarized](episode_5__polarized.md), if Max chooses to sacrifice Chloe, the two may share a long and passionate kiss before Max changes the timeline. If Max sacrifices Arcadia Bay, the two will survive the storm and ride into the sunset (or sunrise depending on when they left).
* If the player presses **Tab** just after the nightmare sequence, they can access Max's last journal entries which are heavily focused on her feelings about Chloe. If the player didn't kiss Chloe in Episode 3, Max asks herself if she has subconsciously been developing some feelings for Chloe. If the player chose to kiss Chloe, Max seems more sure about her feelings. (''[Max's Diary#finalentry](click_here.md) to read the entries'')

## Wine Tasting Sessions 
There are three instances in which Max and Chloe's "wine tasting sessions" are mentioned. The first is when Max is at Chloe's house for the first time in the game and is able to explore the living room. She finds the stain that was left from one time when they had spilt the wine on the ground and it makes her remember that situation vividly. The second one is when Max goes back to 2008 and tries to prevent William's death. When William is leaving the house, he says, "And no Max and Chloe wine tasting sessions." The third instance is when Max makes a passing comment at the Zeitgeist Gallery: "Champagne makes me think of me and Chloe getting busted with that wine..."

If Max sits on the couch in the living room, she will reminisce the moment between her and Chloe:

**Chloe: **Come on, open it chicken!
**Max: **Hold on. And I'm not chicken!
**Chloe: **Prove it! You drink first, Max!
**Max: **No way! It was your idea, Chloe!
**Chloe: **Whateva. Give me that bottle.
**Max: **Well?
**Chloe: **Tasty. Very tasty.
**Max: **Here, I want a sip!
**Chloe: **Sorry, this is not for kids.
**Max: **Don't be greedy! Gimme some!
**Chloe: **Oh shit, the carpet!
**Max: **There's wine all over! What do we do now?
**Chloe: **My parents are coming! Cover it up...
