## Episode Two - "[Episode 2: Out of Time](out_of_time.md)" 
After waking up and exiting [Max's Room](her_room.md), Max encounters Alyssa in the hallway of the dormitories reading notices on a noticeboard. Moments later, a student opens the door of the girls' bathroom from inside and throws a toilet paper roll at Alyssa. If Max tries to talk to Alyssa, she will call the person with the toilet paper an "immature asshole" and say that she's not 'feeling social'. Max has the option to rewind time and warn her about the incoming threat, letting the toilet paper hit the wall and roll away. Alyssa will then be more eager to talk to Max.

Warned Alyssa in Episode 1# Warned Alyssa in Episode 1If Max helped Alyssa in the previous episode, Alyssa will say that now Max has saved her from a "projectile weapon" twice already and will question Max being her guardian angel. Max says that it is simply her sixth sense in action and that she's glad she could help.

Alyssa mentions that Warren told her about having lent Max his flash drive and asks Max about her favorite sci-fi film. Max may name one of the following three: *{{Wiki|Looper}}*, *{{Wiki|Back to the Future}}* and *{{Wiki|Groundhog Day}}*. Alyssa will make a short comment about the chosen film and warns Max to be careful not to make [Brooke Scott](brooke_scott.md) jealous. She then continues examining the noticeboard. If Max tries to talk to her again, Alyssa will say that they should talk later and wishes Max good luck with Warren.

Later in the episode, Alyssa is standing near the window of the [Photography Lab](photography_lab.md) and will brush off Max's attempts to talk to her. Max has the opportunity to take an [Optional Photos](optional_photo.md) of Alyssa from behind. Shortly after the beginning of Mr. Jefferson's class, Alyssa comments on Kate not feeling well when Jefferson questions if anybody has seen her that day.

During the lesson, Zachary will burst into the classroom to exclaim that "crazy shit" is happening at the girls' dormitory, prompting everyone in the class to rush there. Alyssa can be seen among the crowd watching Kate's suicide attempt, with her face laid on Warren's shoulder. If Max hesitates in going forward to rescue Kate, Alyssa can be heard telling Brooke that she cannot believe the situation.

This time around, the puddle water only gets splashed on the sidewalk.
