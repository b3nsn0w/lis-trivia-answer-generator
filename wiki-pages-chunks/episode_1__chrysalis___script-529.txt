## **Optional Conversation with Chloe** 

**Chloe:** So tell me, what does Max Caulfield do for fun now that she's a grown-up?

Party all night.# Party all night.

**Max:** Party all night.

**Chloe:** Not Little Miss Wallflower. I bet you've never even been to a party.

**Max:** Oh, right. I went to your birthday blowout.

**Chloe:** Max, you were 12 years old. That's...sad. You should stick to taking photos.

|-|I don't feel grown up.I don't feel grown up.

**Max:** I don't feel grown up. Just more confused as I get older. Especially after today...

**Chloe:** *(sarcastically)* Gee, thanks. I was hoping to hear something positive.

**Max:** About me?

**Chloe:** No, about me. Duh! I thought you'd at least be happy taking photos... Forget it.

|-|Not much.# Not much.

**Max:** Not much. You know me. I like to observe the world more than participate.

**Chloe:** I can't say I know you anymore. Maybe you love to go clubbin' every night.

**Max:** Can you see me at a rave?

**Chloe:** I'd dose those candy-flipping morons and watch them twitch into a DJ dance death rattle... Take a photo of that.

|-|I take photos. (after rewind)I take photos. (after rewind)

**Max:** I take photos. Of me, the world, everything. It may sound sad, but I have a blast.

**Chloe:** It doesn't sound that sad.

**Max:** I'm happiest when I've got a great image in my lens. I'm not lonely, not afraid...

**Chloe:** Now that's more inspiring. I don't feel so totally hopeless...

''Max turns on the power switch, then searches the metal box under the bed and takes the CD out of it. Noticing a picture of Rachel Amber, she pulls it out and unfolds it to reveal that the other side of the picture shows Chloe. Chloe notices this and snatches the photo out of Max's hand.''
