Here is a section of the wiki page for Episode 3: Chaos Theory - Script:

## **Science Lab** 
**Max:** *(thinking)* Gross, I HATE that formalin smell...

''Max can look at Warren's exam grade on the desk. Warren's grade will differ depending on how much Max helped him in the previous episode. Max has the option to increase his grade.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* You deserve WAY more than this for taking on Nathan, but...every little grade counts...

*Max takes the box of sugar from the end of the desk.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Ooh, sugar.

**Max:** *(thinking) [after getting second item]'' You're halfway home, Max!

''Warren texts Max to check if she's okay. Max responds that she needs to concentrate but will talk to him later.*

**Optional Photo**

*Max looks at the fish in the aquarium.*

**Max:** *(thinking)'' Everybody's asleep... I hate to wake them up, but...I want a picture.

*Max turns on the light in the aquarium.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Good evening, fish-fish.

*Max takes a picture of the fish with her camera.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Thanks, fish. Nice work.

*Max can turn off the light in the aquarium.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Please resume your slumber.

*Max approaches one of the desks in the back of the room. She looks at page of a science textbook talking about sodium chlorate. The book mentions that it is "commonly used as a weedkiller".*

**Max:** *(thinking)* So sodium chlorate is...a weedkiller. *[scoffs]* You'd think Warren would've told me that factoid.

*Max goes to the back of the science lab. She looks at the container of weedkiller on the top of one of the cupboards.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Here's the sodium chlorate box.

*Max reaches her hand up to take the sodium chlorate, but withdraws it.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* You know you're clumsy, Max. Don't waste your rewind power. Use the damn chair!

*Max drags the chair over to the cupboard and steps up on it to take the sodium chlorate. Max returns the chair to its original position.*

**Max:** *(thinking) [after getting third item]* Only one more ingredient left...

*Max enters the the photography lab.*

## **Photography Lab** 
**Max:** *(thinking)* This is like a scene in a horror film...

'''Max's Optional Comments About the Contest Pictures**

**Kate's entry**

**Max:'* *(thinking)* Oh, Kate...even when you were sad you tried to see the good in the world... Shit.

*'Victoria's entry**

**Max:'* *(thinking)* Victoria...that is pretty fucking sweet. How can I hate somebody that shoots like that?

*'Daniel's entry**

**Max:'* *(thinking)'' Daniel's a better illustrator than photographer... *[scoffs] (sarcastically)* Said Max the art critic.

'''Nathan's entry**

**Max:'* *(thinking)'' I feel gross even LOOKING at Nathan's work... *(reluctantly)* But he does have some style...

*Max goes to the back left corner of the room and takes the duct tape next to the printer.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* The tape is mine!

**Max:** *(thinking) [after getting last item]* Now it's time to show Chloe that Max is da bomb!

**Conversation with Chloe**

**Max:** ''[leans down and puts her hand on Chloe's shoulder]* Take it easy on the door, Chloe. *[she and Chloe stand up]'' Let's try this instead. *[shows Chloe pipe bomb]* Boom! Literally.

**Chloe:** Yes! Time to blow shit up!

*Max attaches the pipe bomb to the door handle.*

**Max:** If you'll light the candle...

**Chloe:** This is so cool!

*Chloe leans down and uses her lighter to light the fuse on the pipe bomb. Max and Chloe back away from the door.*

**Max:** Get ready to haul ass.

*Max and Chloe run to the side and crouch down behind the desk. The bomb explodes and the door is blasted open.*

**Chloe:** That...was so fucking cool!

*An alarm goes off.*

**Max:** Oh, we are toast! Here comes the whole Arcadia Bay Fire and Police Department!

**Chloe:** Uh, so what should we do?

''Max enters the principal's office and rewinds to before she and Chloe blasted the door open.*

**Chloe:** *(from behind the door)'' If I can get this bastard open she can't cheat with her rewind... This is bullshit! Fuck you, door!

*Max opens the door from the inside.*
