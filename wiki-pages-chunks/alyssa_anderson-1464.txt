Here is a section of the wiki page for Alyssa Anderson:

## Alternative Timeline 
In the [Alternative Timeline (Life is Strange)](alternative_timeline.md), a text conversation can be read between Alyssa and Max in which Alyssa expresses her disappointment with Max hanging out with the Vortex Club, claiming she thought Max was better than that. Max will then tell her that she saw Alyssa throw a roll of toilet paper at her. Alyssa will claim that she wasn't aiming for Max, only for Max to sternly tell her not to do it again.

## Relationships

#

## Friends 
*[Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) (**Determinant**) - Alyssa seems to have a growing friendship with Max, especially if Max decides to save her from the ills that befall her in each episode. Ultimately, Max feels like they should become better friends due to their common interests of photography and keeping to themselves. They also share an affection for literature and science fiction. Alyssa also supports Max's relationship with Warren.
*[Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md) - They used to hang around a lot, as a photo of both in Kate's room indicates. After the Vortex Club incident, Alyssa doesn't seem to be around her anymore. However, Alyssa still defends Kate when the Vortex Club mocks her after not showing up to class. She considers Kate a good person and a friend, and following her suicide (attempt), she longs for revenge for Kate. If Kate survived, she also plans to visit her in the hospital once she is allowed to have visitors.
*[Warren Graham](warren_graham.md) - Warren and Alyssa share an affection for science fiction and seem to be talking a lot about films, but also about Max (for example he told her that Max borrowed his flash-drive and that she also likes science fiction). Since they regularly spend some time together she's become the target of Brooke's jealousy. Warren also comforts Alyssa when Kate is about to jump from the dormitory roof. One of the main reasons Alyssa attends the Vortex Club Party is that Warren also planned to come. A scribble on a table in the science lab which reads "Warren+Alyssa 2013" indicates that she is, or has been, interested in Warren. However, she also supports Warren's relationship with Max.
*[Stella Hill](stella_hill.md) - Alyssa can be seen smiling with Stella and Kate in a photo Max can find in Kate's Room. 

#

## Enemies 
* [Victoria Chase](victoria_chase.md) - Alyssa clearly dislikes the Vortex Club and especially Victoria.
* [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) (**Determinant**) - If Max doesn't help Alyssa with the wrongdoings that befall her, she will say that Max is bad luck because bad things happen when she's around.

## Symbolism

## Color Symbolism 
The color that Alyssa is the most associated with is purple/violet. Because the purple color is created by combining a strong warm with a strong cool color, the color retains both warm and cool properties. On one hand, the color purple can boost imagination and creativity; on the other hand, too much purple can cause moodiness instead. Light purples are lighthearted, floral, and romantic; the dark shades are more intellectual and dignified. Dark purple hues also evoke feelings of gloom, sadness, and frustration.http://www.bourncreative.com/meaning-of-the-color-purple/ In general, positive meanings of purple/violet include faith, magic, mysticism, unconscious, creativity and contemplative; negative ones even death and mourning. In some Native American tribes, purple represents wisdom, healing or gratitude.http://color-wheel-artist.com/meanings-of-violet.html With a sense of mystic and royal qualities, purple is a color often well-liked by very creative or eccentric types.http://www.sensationalcolor.com/color-meaning/color-meaning-symbolism-psychology/all-about-the-color-purple-4329#.ViFSCPntlBd

## Spirit Animal 
The only animal that seems to be connected with Alyssa is the cockroach (as she's wearing a t-shirt displaying one on the Vortex Club party in "Dark Room").

Cockroaches are from the beetle family within the insect kingdom. All beetles carry metamorphosis energy, and for this reason, the cockroach showing up in your life can indicate a change will soon occur. Cockroaches prefer to keep to the dark and will scurry from the light. For this reason, cockroaches surfacing can be indicators of the desire to pull back from society and keep under the radar of others. If you spend a lot of time socializing, the cockroach could be telling you to spend more time alone. On the flip side, it could also signify that you are isolating yourself too much.http://healing.about.com/od/animaltotems/ig/InsectsArachnids/Cockroaches.htm From what we know about Alyssa, being a more gloomy and anti-social character, the cockroach fits her personality well.

The Cockroach is also said to be impossible to kill and can endure anything including a nuclear fallout. This fits well with Alyssa's never-ending string of bad luck, simply carrying on even after everything that happens to her. Though, much like how the real cockroach isn't invincible, the final episode potentially shows Alyssa eventually being killed by something.
