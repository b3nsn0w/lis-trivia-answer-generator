**[Maxine Caulfield**, Max](maxine_caulfield____max.md)'s comment in "[Episode 4: Dark Room, Dark Room](episode_4__dark_room__dark_room.md)"
The **Prescott Barn** is an old outbuilding located on derelict farmstead grounds owned by the [Prescott Family](prescott_family.md),Ownership of the farmland is mentioned on Page 62 of [Max's Diary](max_s_journal.md) and in an [The Independent#Blackwell Security Uncovers Bunker and Scandal](article.md) by [The Independent](the_independent.md) newspaper that Max can read on the [plane](plane.md) to [San Francisco](san_francisco.md). officially under the name of [Harry Aaron Prescott](harry_aaron_prescott.md). It is an old, dilapidated, and explorable area in [Episode 4: Dark Room](episode_4.md).

## Episode Four: "[Episode 4: Dark Room](dark_room.md)" 
[Maxine Caulfield](max.md) and [Chloe Price](chloe.md) are led to the barn after their investigation into [Nathan Prescott](nathan.md)'s involvement in drugging [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md). Discovering the coordinates of the barn thanks to information provided by [David Madsen](david_madsen.md)'s [David's Files](files.md), the girls head out to explore the barn.

Outside, they discover fresh tire tracks and a firmly padlocked entrance, as well as an unfitting modern power supply leading into the derelict building. Max goes around the side to discover a movable metal panel, and the girls enter.

Inside, they discover a chest with information about old deals within the Prescott family, as well as photographs and letters relating to the family.

As Max continues to search the barn, she finds a trapdoor, which is suspiciously more modern than the rest of the barn. She breaks the lock, and the girls discover a code-locked door leading to what is known as the [Dark Room (Location)](dark_room.md), or the Prescott Bunker.

## Episode Five: "[Episode 5: Polarized](polarized.md)" 
After being rescued from the Dark Room by David, Max goes outside and calls [Warren Graham](warren.md) in an attempt to save Chloe. She learns that Warren is in the [Two Whales Diner](two_whales_diner.md), and drives there using [Mark Jefferson](mark_jefferson.md)'s car, which is parked inside the barn.
