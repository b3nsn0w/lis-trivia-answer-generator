**David to [Maxine Caulfield**, Max](maxine_caulfield____max.md) in "[Episode 1: Chrysalis, Chrysalis](episode_1__chrysalis__chrysalis.md)"

**David N. Madsen**Evident from his [Media:Note-chloeshouse-dogtags.png](dog_tags.md) in a drawer in the garage. is a recurring character in *[Life is Strange](life_is_strange.md)*. He was a war veteran and is the security guard at [Blackwell Academy](blackwell_academy.md). He is married to [Joyce Madsen](joyce_madsen.md), and is [Chloe Price](chloe_price.md)'s stepfather.

In the first four episodes, David plays the role of a red herring. His aggressive and paranoid behavior, in addition to his suspicious monitoring of students, paints him as an antagonist. He is later revealed to be a hidden protagonist after many of his suspicions turn out to be true and many of his strict precautions (such as keeping close tabs on students) wind up being well-founded.

David reappears in *[Life is Strange: Before the Storm](before_the_storm.md)*, the prequel to the events of *[Life is Strange](life_is_strange.md)*. He also reappears in the sequel, *[Life is Strange 2](life_is_strange_2.md)*.

## Personality 
The way David behaves is often rude and aggressive. He also appears to suffer from PTSD and paranoia after his time in the military. He seems to have an unhealthy obsession with surveillance. However, he ultimately cares about the Blackwell students and his family but finds it difficult to show them due to his brusque attitude.

He references how difficult it is for a soldier to return to regular life, which offers an explanation into his abrasive behavior. There is a well-read copy of a book about this subject in David's garage.

## Biography 
The following is what [Maxine Caulfield](max.md) wrote about David in her [Max's Journal](journal.md):

''Whoa, I swear that security guard is the biggest ass here. And that's saying a lot. He always treats everybody like they've committed a crime or they're about to commit one. He grilled me in the hall today and I thought he was going to arrest me. I don't know much about him but I heard he was kicked out of the army or something.*

*So of course he would end up at Blackwell Academy in charge of security. Aren't you supposed to feel, I don't know, SECURE, on campus?*

*Bro-dude swaggers everywhere with that badge and gun like he's looking to tase somebody. He would make a good photo portrait of authority though. Who does a guy like that marry? I feel sorry for his family.''That's a very ironic allusion/foreshadowing regarding who Max shortly afterwards finds out is his family.'' It would be like living in a barracks. Shudder. Just another person I have to avoid at Blackwell. Collect 'em all.''
