## Background 
[File:Nathanroom-photowithdad.png](thumb.md)

The [Prescott Family](prescott_family.md) is known to be the oldest and most influential family of [Arcadia Bay](arcadia_bay.md). The Prescotts are wealthy and supply substantial funding to Blackwell Academy, going as far as donating a new [Prescott Dormitory](dormitory.md) for the school's use. Nathan's father, [Sean Prescott](sean_prescott.md), has a lot of influence on [Raymond Wells](principal_wells.md) which, in turn, affects his son's treatment at the academy. There is a wide rumor around town that even the [Arcadia Bay Police Department](local_police.md) are under the thumb of the Prescotts. The Prescotts are also responsible for a new development called "[Pan Estates](pan_estates.md)" that is scheduled to be built in Arcadia Bay.This can be seen on a [Media:Pan Estates poster.png](flyer.md) inside the Two Whales Diner.

Despite owning most of Arcadia Bay, the Prescotts may be from Florida instead of Arcadia Bay considering Nathan was born in Fort Lauderdale and there are many instances where both Nathan and his father call Arcadia Bay a "shithole"."This shithole town is going to get an enema along with a fresh brand." - excerpt from an [Media:Note4-nathanroom-seanmail2.png](email.md) from Sean Prescott to Nathan, visible in Episode 4. It's possible that Nathan's family lived in Florida for a while, but considering their ancestors already ruled over the town, they later returned to continue the family's legacy.

Nathan is presumed to be the youngest son in the Prescott family and has a record of being violent and acting out, which is implied to be due to the pressures placed upon him by his parents (specifically his father) in order to keep the Prescott reputation intact.An [Media:Note4-nathanroom-seanmail2.png](email.md) from Sean Prescott to Nathan, visible in Episode 4. According to Blackwell school records, Nathan, at least once, referred to himself as "Nathan Prescott the third" evidencing a condescending attitude among many Prescott family members rooting from the family's abundant wealth."Nathan Prescott the Third." Oooh, he's so money. And you know the Prescotts dropped major bank to bury Nathan's real file... Look, it reads like a rap sheetâ€”bad grades, teacher complaints, secret probation... But I was expelled?" Chloe, while reading Nathan's school records in Episode 3.

Nathan has been in psychiatric treatment for at least five years, which is evident by a letter from one of his psychiatrists and can be found in the [Episode 4: Dark Room](dark_room.md) in Episode 4.[Media:Dr. Jacoby's Letter to Nathan's Father.jpg](letter.md) from his psychiatrist.

Letters can be found sent from Nathan's father regarding Nathan's unruly behavior in school. However, Nathan's father seems to be willingly disconnected from his son and his son's mental health and instead pacifies Nathan's outbursts with threats to the school and its financial support supplied by the Prescotts.

While searching through [Nathan's Computer](nathan_s_computer.md) during "Dark Room", Max can find a caring email sent to Nathan from his supportive older sister, [Kristine Prescott](kristine.md), who states she is in Brazil, leaving Nathan on his own to deal with his father. Despite this, she tries to encourage Nathan to stand up to their father.An [Media:Note4-nathanroom-kristinemail2.png](email.md) from Kristine Prescott to Nathan visible on his computer in Episode 4.

At Blackwell, Nathan retains the position as one of the main Vortex Club representatives and, by most Blackwell students, a recreational drug dealer. Nathan is evidenced to cut his drugs with powerful laxatives bought online after buying them from local drug dealer [Frank Bowers](frank_bowers.md).

Nathan is also a known partier and drinker and usually supplies the drugs and alcohol at the parties he attends. Nathan's family influence affords the Vortex Club with prestigious benefits, such as note-worthy DJs and the lack of surveillance by the authorities--a fact indicated by Nathan while referencing [The End of the World Party](the_end_of_the_world_party.md).
