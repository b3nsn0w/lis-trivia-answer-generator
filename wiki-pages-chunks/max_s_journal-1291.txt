'''Max's Journal''' records [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md)'s experiences throughout the events of *[Life is Strange](life_is_strange.md)*. It includes her [Max's Diary](diary.md), [Max's Character Notes](details_on_some_characters.md) Max encounters, [Max's Notes](notes_on_items.md) of Max's interest, her [Optional Photos](optional_photos.md), and [Max's Messages](sms_messages.md). Her journal pages are full of scribbles, drawings, watercolor doodles, stickers and other memorabilia such as photos, booklets, postcards, notes, stamps or calendar pages. 

Max's journal is designed, laid out, and illustrated by [Alexis Bauzet](alexis_bauzet.md) and [Alysianne Bui](alyzian.md).

## Nightmare Journal 
[File:Maxnightmarejournal.png](thumb.md)In "[Episode 5: Polarized](polarized.md)", Max must use her journal to escape the clutches of [Mark Jefferson](jefferson.md) briefly before traveling to another alternative situation in which the journal is burnt, disabling her from using it against Jefferson.

In Max's [Max's Nightmare](nightmare.md) scenes, opening the journal reveals violent and contorted versions of her entries which become laced with Jefferson quotes. This also affects her pictures, texts, and character notes.

## Cropped Pieces and Scraps 
#

## Flyers 
Five flyers and a diary agenda page in Max's journal have matching pieces that can be found on other pages. Out of these six things with matching pieces, only three have completing "halves" - the remaining three have missing information that was cropped from the middle in the layout stage during development of *Life is Strange*. The top three items in the image below are the only items that can be fully completed.Completed by using the original textures found in the game files, as all of the flyers and scraps in the journal's left and right margins are partially obscured during layout. The bottom three are those with missing information which cannot be found in the game files. According to journal artist Alyzian, the missing information is as follows:
* Sugarcoat everything - a fair entertainment - Main place, Arcadia Bay - 8th to 30th of July, - $10 adult, $5 children under 14.
* Top-Down Reversed.
* Dusk&Dawn gallery Seattle Presents "Bodies and Splatters" photography exhibition.

## Map Scraps 
Three map scraps can be found in Max's journal. When these are pieced together, they make an incomplete map of Oregon, California, Nevada, and Idaho. *(The "Rogue" and "Snake" in different colors may be references to X-Men and Metal Gear Solid. TBC with the artist.)*
