*[File:Max's scribbles.png](thumb.md)The doodles on Max's notebook in Jefferson's class include the phrase "[w:c:gameofthrones:Winter is Coming (motto)](winter_is_coming.md)", which is a reference to the central motto of *{{Wiki|Game of Thrones}}*.It expresses the sentiment that there are always dark periods in each our lives, and even if things are good now ("summer"), we must always be ready for a dark period when events turn against us ("winter"). This can be considered a foreshadowing regarding the following dark events. There also seems to be a scribble of [w:c:villains:Frank (Donnie Darko)](frank_the_rabbit.md) from *Donnie Darko*. Frank The Rabbit is a person named Frank in a life-size demonic-looking rabbit costume who has the ability to move through time, and who warns Donnie, the protagonist of *Donnie Darko*, that the world is going to end in a specific amount of time. His objective is to guide Donnie in his path to correcting the timeline of the primary universe to prevent the world's destruction.
*At the beginning of the episode, Mr. Jefferson utters "Bueller", when no one volunteers to answer one of his questions, referring to the protagonist from the 1986 American teen comedy film ''{{Wiki|Ferris Bueller's Day Off}}'', a carefree teenager who pretends to be sick and skips school one beautiful spring day.
*During his lecture, Jefferson references several famous artists and their works: TBA
*When talking to Max, Mr. Jefferson recites {{Wiki|John Lennon}}'s famous quote, "Life is what happens while you're busy making other plans," when talking to Max in his classroom.
*When Max is answering to principal Wells "You look a little stressed out, are you okay?", she replies with, "I'm...

*When looking at the window in Jefferson's classroom after rewinding for the first time, Max says she feels like she's in *{{Wiki|Groundhog Day}}*, a comedy movie about a man who is caught in a time loop and has to experience the same day again and again. Max also comments that her situation despite the resemblance to the film isn't funny referring to it being a comedy piece.
*When [Ms. Grant](ms__grant.md) refers to Blackwell "going back to 1984" when talking to Max about her anti-surveillance petition, she is referencing the {{Wiki|George Orwell}} novel *{{Wiki|Nineteen Eighty-Four}}*. Written in 1949, *Nineteen Eighty-Four* focused on omnipresent government surveillance and thus represents a parallel to David Madsen's planned surveillance at Blackwell.
*[Brooke Scott](brooke_scott.md)'s hoodie design from this episode is a reference to *Star Wars*, representing three light sabers, as officially confirmed by [Don't Nod](dontnod.md) on Twitter.DONTNOD confirmed this reference on [https://twitter.com/DONTNOD_Ent/status/727889665034989568 Twitter] on the 4th of May, 2016, the international {{Wiki|Star_Wars_Day|Star Wars Day}}.

*The t-shirt [Justin Williams](justin_williams.md) wears in this episode is a reference to the 1975 shark attack thriller *{{Wiki|Jaws (film)|Jaws}}*, directed by {{Wiki|Steven Spielberg}}. It says "RAWS" and has a similar style to the film cover.

* The graffiti "hole to another universe" seen in Chloe's room seems to have been heavily inspired by a product made by the American designer Dan Golden in April 2012. Strangely enough, the same picture features a guitar almost identical to Max's and the [https://www.whatisblik.com/collections/dan-golden other products] from this designer all revolve around time-travel.
