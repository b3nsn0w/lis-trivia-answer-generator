pocket.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* You wanted me to enter the contest, asshole.

*Max grabs her bag and gets up from her seat.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* So maybe I'll be going to San Francisco. And, Jefferson...you'll be going to prison.

''Max's nose starts bleeding and she wipes the blood away.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* The past within the past... *[sighs]* Am I pushing myself too hard?

**Optional Conversation with Kate**

*Max approaches Kate and Kate looks up at her.''

**Max:** Hi, Kate...

**Kate:** Oh... Hey, Max.

**Max:** Kate, listen to me...

**Kate:** I am.

**Max:** Always remember that you're not alone. I've got your back, no matter what happens. So do a lot of other people. We all care. We're all here for you. You need to know that.

**Kate:** Max... That makes me feel so blessed for the first time this week... I...I don't know what to say...

**Max:** That's okay, neither do I. Maybe we could both use a hug.

*Kate gets up and she and Max hug.*

**Kate:** Thanks. You always know the right thing to do.

*Kate returns to her desk.*

**Conversation with Jefferson and Victoria**

**Max:** *[crosses her arms]* Mr. Jefferson? We need to talk.

**Jefferson:** Uh—

**Victoria:** Can you see I'm talking to Mr. Jefferson now?

(Victoria was kidnapped)(Victoria was kidnapped)

**Max:** Yes, I see. But maybe you shouldn't...

**Victoria:** Uh, and why not?

**Jefferson:** Hold on, Victoria. Are you okay, Max?

**Max:** I will be when Victoria realizes that hiding behind a screen, posting videos of people is incredibly cruel and unfair. You're smart enough to know how easy it is to hurt somebody, to destroy their life. I just want you to think about how much it would hurt if somebody did that to you. You can always make the right choice, Victoria. I know you've got a good heart. I've seen it.

**Victoria:** Listen...I...I didn't...

**Max:** You don't have to explain. There's no reason for you to be so insecure you can't be happy with your own talent. Wouldn't it be better to lift people up than to bring them down? You could inspire people...

**Victoria:** Okay, I don't know what you're talking about now... Do I, Mr. Jefferson?

**Jefferson:** I think I should stay out of this one, Victoria.

**Victoria:** *[crosses her arms]* Then I guess I'm done talking.

**Max:** And that's okay too.

*Victoria leaves the classroom.*

**Jefferson:** That was kind of random, Max. What did you mean?

|-|(Victoria wasn't kidnapped)# (Victoria wasn't kidnapped)

**Max:** I can see you're kissing ass again. Nothing new.

**Victoria:** What did you just say?!

**Jefferson:** Hold on, Victoria. Are you okay, Max?

**Max:** Not until Victoria knows that hiding behind a screen and posting videos of people is totally fucked up. You know how easy it is to hurt somebody, to destroy their life? Are you proud of yourself? If you have any feelings left, you should think about your actions.

**Victoria:** Listen... *[scoffs]* I—I didn't...

**Max:** Of course you did! You're so insecure, you can't even be happy with your own talent. You have to try and bring everybody down to your mean and ugly lev—

**Victoria:** Okay, *(angrily)* I do not have to listen to this bullshit... Do I, Mr. Jefferson?

**Jefferson:** Well, it looks like you already did, Victoria.

**Victoria:** *[crosses her arms]* Then I guess I'm...done talking.

**Max:** I sure hope so.

*Victoria leaves the classroom.*

**Jefferson:** *[chuckles]* I'm not going to say I didn't enjoy that, but...why?

*Max takes her selfie out and hands it to Jefferson.*

**Max:** Here's my photograph for the "Everyday Heroes" contest.

**Jefferson:** Oh, uh... That was easy.

**Max:** No... It wasn't easy at all.

**Jefferson:** Well, I, uh... I—I can't pre-judge yet, but I'm very...happy you decided to enter. That means a lot to me...and Blackwell. The—the first step for any artist is to put themselves out there, in the world, without fear. To be...innocent.

**Max:** Or guilty.

**Jefferson:** Uh... *[chuckles awkwardly]* Well... Thanks...for the photo. Maybe both of us will be jet-setting to San Francisco this Friday.

**Max:** Or maybe only one of us will be going.

**Jefferson:** Don't be so modest, Max. Anything can happen in a week...

**Max:** As you're going to find out, Mr. Jefferson.
