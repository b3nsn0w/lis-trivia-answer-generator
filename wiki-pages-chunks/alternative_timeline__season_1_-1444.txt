Here is a section of the wiki page for Alternative Timeline (Season 1):

## Trivia 
*There is a blue {{Wiki|Awareness ribbon}} on the photo album in Alternative Chloe’s room. Among its meanings is ARDS ({{Wiki|Acute respiratory distress syndrome|Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome}}), a medical condition that may be caused by trauma.
*During a conversation with Alternative Chloe, Max mentions the two of them watched *{{Wiki|Power Rangers}}* as children. When Max looks at Chloe's IV drip, she makes a reference to the {{Wiki|Mighty Morphin Power Rangers}}: "That must be her mighty morphine machine..."
*Joyce's aunt, [Dorothy](aunt_dorothy.md), is believed to be a reference to {{Wiki|L. Frank Baum}}'s {{Wiki|Dorothy Gale}} from *{{Wiki|The Wizard of Oz}}*.
*In a letter addressed to William and Joyce by Ray Wells, Wells suggests taking Chloe to "Miskatonic Institute", a school that caters to disabled persons. In {{Wiki|H.P. Lovecraft}}'s {{Wiki|Cthulhu Mythos}}, {{Wiki|Miskatonic University}} is a fictional university that first appeared in the 1922 story, *{{Wiki|Herbert West–Reanimator}}*.
*In an article discussing the Prescott Family, the writer's name is Craig Kennedy. {{Wiki|Craig Kennedy|Professor Craig Kennedy}} is a character that appeared in *Sherlock Holmes* novels written by Arthur B. Reeve.
*In a letter to Joyce from the Arcadia Bay Spinal Center, Dr. Anton Phibes details the Alternative Chloe Price's deteriorating respiratory system. Dr. Anton Phibes was a character in the 1971 British horror film *{{Wiki|The Abominable Dr. Phibes}}*.
*The Alternative Price family is apparently indebted to Donald Clamp lenders, which might be a reference to the corrupt local Clamp corporation from *Gremlins 2.*
*On Alternative Chloe's computer, Max can find a conversation in an online chatroom with someone who's about to start watching *Quantum Leap*.
*Alternative Chloe refers to herself as "Chloe of the Caribbean", which is a reference to the movie *{{Wiki|Pirates of the Caribbean}}*.
*When discussing {{Wiki|Ridley Scott}}'s *{{Wiki|Blade Runner}}*, an adaptation of {{Wiki|Philip K. Dick}}'s novel *{{Wiki|Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?}},* Alternative Chloe mentions she wanted to dye her hair like {{Wiki|List of Blade Runner characters#Pris Stratton|Pris}} had. Pris, however, never dyed the ends of her bangs.
*Alternative Chloe asks Max whether or not she believed {{Wiki|Rick Deckard|Deckard}} was a {{Wiki|Replicant}}. The question is part of a longstanding discussion that began following the release of the film in 1982. The "Final Cut" leans heavily toward the argument supporting the Deckard-Replicant angle. {{Wiki|Ridley Scott}} has stated multiple times that Deckard was, in fact, a Replicant from the beginning.
*Alternative Chloe refers to her morphine injector as "total {{Wiki|Star Trek}} shit".
*In her diary Max mentions Vangelis, the composer of the much known *Blade Runner* soundtrack.
*When Max returns from the bathroom with the morphine, Chloe says, "Finally. Give me the blue pill…". This is a reference to *{{Wiki|The Matrix}}* where the blue pill allows a state of blissful ignorance/illusion.
* At Blackwell, Max notices that Warren has hooked up with Stella. Stella can be seen wearing a light blue top with the words and emoji "**Cool Story :/**". This mirrors the phrase on the patch that Max has on her bag strap in the original timeline.
