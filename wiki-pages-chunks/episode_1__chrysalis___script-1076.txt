## **Optional Conversation with Daniel**
**Max:** What's up, Daniel?

**Daniel:** Oh, hi Max. Could I, um, ask you a question? Would you mind letting me sketch you? I do put my sketches on Facebook, though...

I'd be honored.# I'd be honored.

**Max:** I'd be honored, Daniel. Makes me feel like a muse.

**Daniel:** Funny you should say that. I was just thinking about my real muse, Rachel Amber...

{{#tag:tabber|What happened to her?What happened to her?

**Max:** So, what happened to her? There's got to be a story.

**Daniel:** She just stopped coming to class. Some people say she ran away, some say she jumped off a cliff. I just hope she's okay.

{{!}}-{{!}}You knew her?# You knew her?

**Max:** You knew her?

**Daniel:** No, but once she asked me to draw her portrait. Oh, she was a natural.

{{!}}-{{!}}Hard to avoid her posters.Hard to avoid her posters.

**Max:** Hard to avoid her posters all over campus.

**Daniel:** Kills me to see her sweet face used as a crime photo... She had a good heart.

{{!}}-{{!}}Start drawing.# Start drawing.

**Max:** Okay, why don't you start drawing me, even though I must be a step down from Rachel...

**Daniel:** No way! You're a...good substitute muse.

*Max sits down and strikes a pose.*

**Daniel:** Oh, that's a good posture. Good, good...

*Daniel shows Max the portrait.*

**Max:** *(smiling)* Best portrait ever.

|-|I'd rather not.I'd rather not.

**Max:** I'd rather not, Daniel. Not that I don't want you to...

**Daniel:** Nevermind. I guess you would be too ashamed. Now I have to get back to my drawing...

## **Optional Conversation with [Evan Harris](evan.md)**
**Max:** Hey, Evan. Mind if I check out your cool portfolio?

**Evan:** Let's see if you're worthy of it, Max. You'll have to answer a simple question: who photographed the famous *Falling Soldier*?

Eugene Smith.# Eugene Smith.

**Max:** Gotta be...Eugene Smith.

**Evan:** Well, they both were famous war photographer images, but you should know the difference. Good try, wrong answer.

|-|Steve McCurry.Steve McCurry.

**Max:** Uh...Steve McCurry?

**Evan:** Unless he could travel back in time, McCurry was born five years after *The Falling Soldier* picture. McCurry also shoots in color. In other words, no portfolio.

|-|Robert Capa.# Robert Capa.

**Max:** Robert Capa, of course. I love his work, despite the controversy about that photo.

**Evan:** My, my. This quiet child knows things.

**Max:** That's why I'm here.

**Evan:** You are a kindred spirit, Max. Would you care for a perusal of my portfolio? It's not a privilege I grant to many...

**Max:** I'd be honored, sir.

|-|Robert Doisneau.Robert Doisneau.

**Max:** Isn't it Robert Doisneau?

**Evan:** Oh, my, you can't even tell the difference between street photography and photojournalism... No portfolio peek for you.

## **Optional Conversation with Evan #2**
**Max:** Hi, Evan.

**Evan:** As you can see, Rachel Amber was my favorite model here. She knew exactly what angles worked best with my eye.

You were close.# You were close.

**Max:** You were close...

**Evan:** Like brother and sister in arms. She understood me, never judged me. I hated her Vortex Club clique, but she never acted like she cared. Her friends were her friends.

|-|What was she like?What was she like?

**Max:** What was she like?

**Evan:** She was, like, mercurial. You know what that means?

**Max:** Of course I do, you snob. I know, I can be a little diva.

**Max:** What do you think happened to her?

**Evan:** Nothing good Max... Nothing good.
