Here is a section of the wiki page for Episode 4: Dark Room - Script:

it was enough to make Kate want to die... And I think you're next.

**Victoria:** Max, that is crazy. Nathan is like one of my best friends. Yes, he takes serious meds, but that's not his fault. His family treats him like a total freak, just because he has little meltdowns.

**Max:** They’re not little anymore. They’re deadly. I don’t care if you hate me or not, but you have to believe me.

**Victoria:** You could have been a major bitch to me when I got hit with that paint... and I deserved it.

**Victoria:** Max, I don't hate you... I actually think you're one of the coolest people at Blackwell... Weird, but cool. You just don't know it yet. Maybe I'm jealous because you don't give a shit what anybody thinks. And I do.

**Victoria:** To be honest, Nathan has been freaking me out lately... He’s not here and I haven’t seen him.

**Max:** Just make sure you stay away from him and stick close to your friends tonight, okay?

**Victoria:** I'll let you boss me around this one time. And I have other people I can go to for protection. Thanks for telling me this, Max. If what you said is true... then you be careful, too.

**Max:** I’ve got my own protection.

**Victoria:** Um, text me if you need anything...

**Max:** I will. Thanks, Victoria.

**Victoria:** Au revoir.

''Victoria will not believe Max's warning if she made fun of her in episode 1, or if she comforted her and the "No need" dialogue option above was selected.''

**Max:** Victoria, enough of this high school bullshit. We're adults now. So listen to me, your life is in serious danger. I know you're close to Nathan... but he is truly unstable and dangerous. He did drug Kate at that party so he could take her some place... dark.

**Victoria:** Oh my God... and I'm the drama queen?

**Max:** Touché. But I am not fucking around here.

**Victoria:** Sorry, but no, no way. Nathan is like one of my best friends. Yes, he takes serious meds but that's not his fault. His family treats him like a total freak, just because he has little meltdowns.

**Max:** They’re not little anymore. They’re deadly. I don’t care if you hate me or not, but you have to believe me.

**Victoria:** I don't believe anything you say. You're full of shit. "Oh, hi, I'm Max Caulfield and I'm so sensitive that butterflies make me cry."

**Max:** Now will you listen?

**Victoria:** No, I won’t.

**Victoria:** You're just pissed because you didn't enter a photo in the contest, and that Mr. Jefferson is going to pick me. A real artist would have busted ass to win... but you just want to take your little retro-selfies. That is so fucking lame and lazy, Max. Just go find a community college.

**Max:** Oh, Victoria, please don't do this. Especially after what happened with Kate... Can't you see I'm serious?

**Victoria:** That's your problem, Max. This is a party. And it's the "end of the world," so I am going to get so wasted even you won't bother me anymore. I'll let Nathan know if he finally shows up. Adios.

**Max:** Au revoir…

**Max:** Oh, um... no reason. I'm glad we finally had a talk, Victoria. I see where you're coming from now.

**Victoria:** I don't blame you for not caring. I totally know I'm a mean bitch... Too much residue from my other school cliques. We are supposed to be adults, right?

**Max:** That's what they tell us... Speaking of, have you seen Nathan?

**Victoria:** Nathan Prescott? Why do you want to know that?

**Max:** Oh, Principal Wells wanted to see us Monday. No big deal.

**Victoria:** I hope he doesn't give you any shit. Actually, I haven't seen Nathan tonight. I swear.

**Max:** Au revoir…

{{!}}-{{!}}(Victoria is hostile)(Victoria is hostile)

**Max:** Never mind. It was good talking to you, Victoria. As usual.

**Victoria:** Eat a dick, Max. You're just jealous of me because I actually do the things you can't. I put my photographs out there, while you hide behind your lame retro-selfies.

**Max:** At least tell me where Nathan is.

**Victoria:** Uh, why do you want to know?

**Max:** Principal Wells wanted to see us Monday. It's no big deal.

**Victoria:** Then why ask me? I haven’t even seen him tonight. Adios.

**Max:** Au revoir…
