Like the original game, *Captain Spirit* has been praised for its well-written and relatable characters, notably protagonist Chris's characterization, its emotional story and the way it tackles childhood and its problematic sides. Furthermore, it was praised for its improvement on graphics and animations, as well as for being a non-linear gaming experience that offers multiple ways of shaping a single playthrough. WCCFTech wrote "Rather than being the normal linear affair, Captain Spirit opens up a set of opportunities that can be completed in any order or ignored altogether."[https://wccftech.com/review/the-awesome-adventures-of-captain-spirit WCCFTech: The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit Review – Hella Good] (June 29, 2018)

It was criticized that the game is quite short and that the ending can be triggered by accident.
