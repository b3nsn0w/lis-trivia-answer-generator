Here is a section of the wiki page for Reddit AMA (Dayeanne Hutton):

something, but I forgot to ask one last thing. Are you (still) friends with any of the voice actors from the game? I know you often have Hannah with you on your streams, but is there anyone else you still talk to? And does the cast of the game keep in touch with each other or have you all branched off to other things? Thanks, and have a good day!

Hello again! I see Nik when we stream and have hung out with Cissy a few times. I'm also getting to know Katy and Hailey from BtS. Some people keep in touch - others don't! :)
