## Episode Four - "[Episode 4: Dark Room](dark_room.md)" 
In this episode, the girls head to the junkyard after seeing pictures in the [Episode 4: Dark Room (Location)](dark_room.md) of Rachel Amber with [Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md) lying dazed and drugged among the garbage. Chloe recognizes the spot and rushes there with Max. They discover the body of Rachel Amber and retch at the foul smell of decay. The [doe](doe.md) once again appears as Max comforts Chloe.

The girls return once more to the junkyard after a text from Nathan about him disposing of Rachel's body. They return to the spot to discover the body is still present. However, before they can act, Max is drugged with a needle in the neck which subdues her rewind power. Chloe is then shot in the forehead by [Mark Jefferson](mark_jefferson.md), and the episode ends.

An owl crosses the path of Max and Chloe during their walk towards Rachel's burial site. This owl is thought by some to be symbolic of Mr. Jefferson's spirit animal and is representative of oncoming death in many instances of folklore across the world. This would make sense when considering that Jefferson's next appearance will be after Chloe's death.
