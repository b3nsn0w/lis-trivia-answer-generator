This article is meant to give a more detailed overview of the things that are known about **Young [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md)** and **Young [Chloe Price](chloe_price.md)** from [Don't Nod](don_t_nod.md)'s original game, [Life is Strange](_life_is_strange_.md). These facts cover up to the time Max moves to Seattle, shortly after the death of [William Price](chloe_s_father.md).It is unknown in *Life is Strange* if Max moved to Seattle with her parents in 2008 or 2009, but she is said to have moved shortly after William's death. *[Life is Strange: Before the Storm](life_is_strange__before_the_storm.md)* by [Deck Nine Games](deck_nine_games.md) implies that William died on 09/28/2008 (a Sunday), an exact week after Max turns 13, and that Max moves away three days after William's death, during his funeral.

## Summary 
Young Max and Chloe grew up as best friends, living just half a mile away from each other in [Arcadia Bay](arcadia_bay.md), Oregon.Max: "To think I lived just half a mile away..." ([Episode 1: Chrysalis](episode_1.md) - Joyce's room, Chloe's house.) They were not known to be quiet kids when they played together,Joyce: "Good morning, Max. You and Chloe are so much quieter now than when you were kids." ([Episode 4: Dark Room](episode_4.md) - Alternative Timeline.) and [Joyce Price](chloe_s_mother.md) would always bust them for being too loud.Max: "Chloe's mom always busted us for being too loud." (Episode 1 - [Chloe's Room](chloe_s_room.md).) Even though they could be a handful, Max was always the quieter and more passive of the two,Max: "You know me. I like to observe the world more than participate." (Episode 1 - Chloe's room.) and comments made by Chloe years later suggest that she thought of Max as a bit of a "wallflower""Not Little Miss Wallflower. I bet you've never even been to a party." (Episode 1 - Chloe's room.) . . . "Not Max The Quiet Wallflower!" (Episode 1 - cliff.) and a "chickenshit."Chloe: "Your power is changing everything, Max. Especially you. I can already tell. You're not so chickenshit anymore." ([Episode 3: Chaos Theory](episode_3.md) - Blackwell Swimming Pool.) As cruel as the latter label sounds, even Max is aware that she can be afraid to confront things.Max: "But like the chickenshit I can be, I didn't go over and stand up for her. I was scared. Sometimes I still feel like a little kid." (Episode 1 - ''[Max's Diary](journal.md)''.) Chloe also thought of Max as a "smartass" for her ability to throw back a good retortChloe: "At least you're still a smartass." (Episode 1 - Reunion chat in Chloe's truck after 5 years of being apart.) as well as being a snoop.Chloe: "Did you take a peek?" . . . Max: "Well, yeah. I couldn't help it." . . . Chloe: "Never change. What did you find?" (Even if Max hesitates after Chloe asks if she's peeked, Chloe will say, "I know that look. You peeked.") Even if Max didn't actually peek at the files, she will tell Chloe, "You know I wanted to." (Episode 1 - Cliff scene with Chloe.) Young Max could also be a little self-absorbed or slow to say her thanks to Chloe.Chloe: "'Oh, and thanks, Chloe!' After five years you're still Max Caulfield." (Episode 1 - reunion in Chloe's truck.)

They both dreamed of a [#Memories](life_of_adventure.md) together,Max: "I always wanted my life to be special… an adventure… but not without you." ([Episode 5: Polarized](episode_5.md) - Beach.) and they saw Seattle as a "fabled faraway island of treasure and adventure" that they were always seeking.Max: "When we would play pirates in our rooms and in the woods, it seemed like Seattle was that fabled faraway island of treasure and adventure that we were always seeking. With coffee shops." (Episode 1 - *Journal*.)
Max wanted to explore the world and be a photographer, but she doubted her ability to achieve this dream.Max: "I would love to be a photographer. As if I ever could be..." (Episode 1 - Max's memories, Chloe's swing, backyard.) However, Chloe believed in Max from an early age and told Max that her pictures could be in a museum, believing that they would be someday."What are you talking about? Max, you are a photographer. Your pictures could be in a museum. Someday they will. I believe in you..." (Episode 1 - Max's memories, Chloe's swing, backyard.) Oddly enough, even though some pictures were taken of Max and Chloe together, Max didn't seem to like pictures of herself. Max: *"I hate pictures of myself!"* {{Headphones|file# Cue_E3_8A_Kitchen_FocusPicture_Max_100.ogg}} (Episode 3 - Photo focus echo from the past, Max's dorm room.)Because of this, it seems unlikely that young Max would be the selfie-taking person she becomes years later.

Even from a young age, Chloe supported Max just as much as Max thought Chloe was amazing.Max: "But you're still amazing. You always have been since we were kids." (Episode 4 - Alternative Timeline, Chloe's garage bedroom.) Even as years passed, and they both lived separate lives, both girls hung on to mementos of their childhood friendship.
