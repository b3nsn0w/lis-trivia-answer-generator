**Max:** Jesus, Kate, I'm sorry. This is serious shit.

**Kate:** How do I get a viral video taken down? I know it's already spreading--what if my church sees that? I need to know what to do...

**Max:** Kate, we'll figure it out. I'll check back later, okay?

**Kate:** Thanks, Max... You can put my book here, near my bag.

''Max places the book next to Kate's bag.''

**Kate:** So, Max, can I ask you a question? And please be honest.

**Max:** Absolutely, Kate. Anything.

**Kate:** I need to find out if Nathan Prescott helped me...or hurt me after that party. Should I go to the police?

GO TO THE POLICE# GO TO THE POLICE**Max:** Yes, you should definitely go to the police, Kate. I totally believe every word you say. Nathan Prescott is truly dangerous.

**Kate:** Bless you, Max. I will go to the police...and also Principal Wells. With you as my back-up witness, they'll have to take us seriously now.

**Max:** Back-up witness? Well, I mean, I believe you and everything, but...we're still just spoiled punk students to the cops and faculty... I just think we need to be very careful here...

**Kate:** Why? Careful of what?

**Max:** Nothing...except the Prescotts are a powerful family. I hope this won't backfire on us, that's all. Even though that rich bastard has earned some serious bad karma. He'll get it...

**Max (thinking):** Time out, Max. You actually told Kate to go to the police and the Principal...after getting a scary text threat. Now the police will definitely drag you into this shit.

|-|LOOK FOR PROOFLOOK FOR PROOF**Max:** If you do that, they won't believe you. You're on video grabbing at all those guys and they'll use that against you. Bad.

**Kate:** But I know I was drugged--

**Max:** That's what you have to prove. Not them. I'm just telling you how the cops and school will look at this. The video doesn't exactly back you up...

**Kate:** You make me feel so hopeless--

**Max:** No, no, Kate. I just don't want you to get hurt any more...

**Kate:** That seems impossible at this point. So that's your answer?

**Max:** I think we should wait. There are other things going on that might help you.

**Kate:** But not right now. So I can walk down the halls with people calling me a viral slut. Thanks, Max.

**Max (thinking):** Good job, Dr. Max. She didn't like what I had to say, but we need more proof of what happened.

''Max leaves Kate's room.*

*Optional: Max enters Dana's room.*

# # ## *'Dana's Room'* 
*If Max enters Dana's room while Dana is dancing on her bed, Stella can be heard through the wall complaining about the loud music.*

**Stella:** Turn the goddamn music down! People sleeping!

*Juliet can be found here after Max takes a shower.*

**Optional Conversation with Dana**

*This conversation can take place before or after Max's shower.''

Touched Dana's pregnancy test# Touched Dana's pregnancy test**Max:** Uh, hi, Dana. Do you hate me?

**Dana:** No Max, I don't hate you. Not that I don't like juicy gossip... I just wish you weren't so nosey.

**Max:** It's like my fatal character flaw.

**Dana:** Or a gift. You're very good at being nosey.

**Max:** Because I care.

**Dana:** I would laugh, but you did save me yesterday. So let's call it even.

|-|Didn't talk to Dana about pregnancyDidn't talk to Dana about pregnancy**Max:** What's happening, Dana? Everything cool between you and Juliet?

**Dana:** Oh, yeah. Thanks again for releasing me from her captivity.

|-|Talked to Dana about pregnancy# Talked to Dana about pregnancy**Max:** Hi, Dana, how are you?

**Dana:** Much better than yesterday. I'm glad we talked.

{{#tag:tabber|Me too.Me too.**Max:** Me too. I know it's good to just talk about...this stuff.

{{!}}-{{!}}Are you?# Are you?**Max:** Are you? I'm not trying to get into your business...

**Dana:** You're almost psychic. I felt like you knew everything anyway...

**Dana:** By the way, the best and biggest news of the day is that Trevor asked me to the Halloween shindig.

**Max:** That's awesome, Dana.

**Dana:** At least we're showing our faces together in public... So you absolutely should go with us. Borrow one of my outfits and come as a cute geek couple with your bitch Warren...

**Max:** Err, I'm not big on cosplay.

**Dana:** Don't let life pass you by, Max. So, are you coming to the party or not?

Why not.Why not?
**Max:** Why the fuck not? If I hate it, I can always go back...to my room.

**Dana:** That's the spirit, Max! After this, you'll be ready for a rave...

**Max:** It does sound like fun. Now I have to go contemplate my party future...

|-|No.# No.
**Max:** No, sorry. It's just...not my thing.

**Dana:** You came to Blackwell to discover yourself, not hide in your dorm.

**Max:** I won't discover myself avoiding projectile vomit from bro-dudes. Thanks anyway.

*If Max tries to talk to Dana again*

**Dana:** Let's talk later, Max.

''Max leaves Dana's room.*

*Max leaves the Girls' Dormitories.''
