Here is a section of the wiki page for San Diego Comic Con 2019 (July 20, 2019):

sometimes, when I'm listening to a tune, I'm telling to Raoul, "Listen to this, what do you think about this? I've written this scene while I was listening to this." And I remember, on the other end, sometimes, Raoul comes to me, and says, "Okay, on what scene are you working?" I'm working on, for example, for the end of Episode 3. "Okay, this will be the song we will add in the game." So I put on my headphones, and I'm writing all the scene, all the ending scene of Episode 3 with the music, so I think it helped me a lot to see the images I want [to] put on the paper.

**Raoul:** Sometimes, we manage to pick a song very quickly.

**Lucy:** Yeah.

**Raoul:** And sometimes, because, of course, I'm not the only one - even though I'm taking the final decision - I talk a lot with the audio team, with Jean-Luc, with Michel to be sure that this song is accurate and is a good one. So it takes a lot of time, and sometimes you don't have, for example, the rights, or it's too expensive, or the artists say, "No." So it depends, but, yeah, when it works and when we can have it earlier, I think the process is quite good. For Episode 3, the ending, and the *[D.A.N.C.E.](justice.md)* scene, I knew since the beginning what other song I wanted.

**Lucy:** That's cool.

**Raoul:** So very quickly, we can work with the camera artists. [Dontnod staff member name needed] has made this scene with the *Justice* song and the one with *[Natalie](milk_and_bone.md)* at the end of Episode 3. And I think those scenes are working well, also, because we had the music before, and we can really shape the camera, so editing with the music in head.

**Lucy:** I would love to discuss music more with you guys, but, unfortunately, time is not on our side, so we might have to go straight to the Q and A. So, if anyone has any burning questions for Raoul and Jean-Luc and would love to ask them, please, come up to the microphone right in the middle, and fire away. We've got about ten minutes or so for Q and A so, please, feel free. ## Q & A session 
**Q:** So, my question is, there's a lot of different routes these games can be taken, because the consequences mattered. In your minds, is there a canonical or preferential way that a character will act or the way a story goes? Like, first Life is Strange, you can have Max make some pretty drastic decision that ends the lives of a few different friends, or have a [unintelligible few words] and save almost everybody.

**Jean-Luc:** Ummm... okay. [Laughs]

**Raoul:** Good question.

**Jean-Luc:** There is no canon ending or no canon path in Life is Strange, because what we want to do with these games is to let the player have his own experience. But... erm... [looks at Raoul] yeah, we'll say something you've never seen before: There is one canon ending in the first Life is Strange, and this is when you choose to [rubs microphone to create interfere and pretends to carry on speaking].

[Panel and audience laughs.]

**Jean-Luc:** [Unintelligible first couple of words] the canon ending.

**Lucy:** What a troll. What a troll.

**Q:** Your protagonists are usually under-represented characters in media, so when you take these characters - and I'm Latino, so when I see Daniel and Sean, I see myself, I see my cousins, I see people that I grew up with - do you feel an added pressure knowing that you're representing characters that maybe we don't see very often? And, if that's the case, how do you prepare to, you know, write stories that don't get seen very often?

**Raoul:** Thank you for this great question. Yeah, like you say, it's pressure. It's always pressure, in fact. Even, like we were describing before, as French to create something taking place in America is a pressure, and I think when you write a woman, for example, as we are men, we really have to be careful, and I think it's work, only. It's researches, talking with people, trying to understand the reality behind those choices and those stories, and just trying to do it in a respectful way. I hope we manage to do it. I don't think we do it just for the sake of doing it, you know? It's also because we want to talk about some subjects, so we create some characters and the stories that will allow us to put the player in those situations, because we really think a video game is the best media to do that to ask yourself some questions. I think a scene, even if I love cinema and doing animated feature or so, but when you are on the controlling end, and you have to make choices depending on those difficult situations. I think it's really, really strong, and I think it's why we all love video games to be part of those stories and to have this interactivity.
**Jean-Luc:** As Raoul said, we are making a lot of research, and every time I write a scene, I give it to Michel, Raoul, and the team, and we have a lot of people [unintelligible words] as accurate as possible, respectful, because we knew as creators we need to be the best as possible. So, yeah, it's important to us for-- Today, video games are-- You can do and can play whatever you want, and it's important for us to talk about minorities or to create a character to show people that there are different people in the world. So, yeah, it's important for us, and we try to do it the best we can.

**Lucy:** Episode 4 is right around the corner - August the 22nd - so keep your eyes for that. Thank you, Raoul and Jean-Luc for being here. It's been fantastic.

[Audience applauds]

**Lucy:** And also, guys, there will be a signing in about half an hour's time at the Titan Entertainment booth 5537, so if you wanna catch up with the guys, meet them a bit more close, in person, get something signed, do head over there. It's been an absolute pleasure hosting for you today, and enjoy the rest of San Diego Comic Con. Thank you.

[Raoul and Jean-Luc say goodbye]
