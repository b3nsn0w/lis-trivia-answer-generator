Here is a section of the wiki page for Victoria Chase:

## Episode Five - "[Episode 5: Polarized](polarized.md)" 
Victoria's fate in this episode depends on Max's previous decisions: whether she warned Victoria and whether Victoria believed her.

|-|Victoria believed Max's warningVictoria believed Max's warning
After Max warns Victoria at the party, it is discovered that Victoria naively ran to Jefferson for help, which leads to her being drugged and tied up before waking up in the Dark Room on the floor next to Max. She will plead to Max to help her, but Max becomes absent after jumping into a photo to try and reverse the events that led to them both being there. Victoria will be murdered by Jefferson while Max is 'inside the photo'.

|-|­­­­­Victoria didn't believe Max's warning/Max didn't warn Victoria# ­­­­­Victoria didn't believe Max's warning/Max didn't warn Victoria
If Max didn't warn Victoria or she didn't believe Max's warning in the last episode, Victoria won't be seen in the Dark Room and is believed to be safe.

Victoria is seen once again when Max travels back in time to Jefferson's class on Monday. Victoria will express her disdain for Max after Max gives a blasé answer to Jefferson's question. Once the class finishes, Victoria will talk to Jefferson at his desk (as she did before).

Max can inspect [Media:Note5-artclass-vicnotebook.png](victoria_s_notebook.md) in which she wrote that "Mark Jefferson rules" but only seems to care about Max. She acknowledges her envy for Max and writes that she should "get over [herself]".

Max approaches both of them at Jefferson's desk and tells him that they need to talk, which Victoria will rudely interject to say she is already talking with him.

Max will say that maybe Victoria shouldn't (talk to him) and will lecture her about Kate in a non-hostile way. Victoria will be taken aback by Max's statements and turns to Jefferson to ask if he knows what Max means, but Jefferson will respond by saying he is staying out of it. Victoria is annoyed by Jefferson's response and leaves the classroom.

Max will comment that she sees Victoria is kissing ass again and will lecture her about Kate in a stern way. Victoria will say, "I do not have to listen to this bullshit" before turning to her teacher to say, "Do I, Mr. Jefferson?", expecting backup. Jefferson will respond by saying that he believes she already did. Victoria is angered by Max and Jefferson and leaves the classroom.

After Max enters her photo for the Everyday Heroes Contest, changes the past and ends up as the winner, Victoria's body language appears angry, and Taylor is seen comforting her.

In the dormitory section of [Max's Nightmare](max_s_nightmare.md), Max briefly turns into Victoria. Victoria also appears in the Dark Room section where Max's insecurities haunt her in the form of having to watch Victoria and Chloe flirt and kiss each other before her very eyes. Further on in Max's nightmare, Victoria will be sitting across from Nathan in the Two Whales diner.

Her final appearance depends entirely on Max's final choice (at the end of the game):

|-|Max sacrifices ChloeMax sacrifices Chloe
If Max fixes the original timeline, then Victoria will be present at the cemetery with Max, Joyce, David, Principal Wells, Kate, Warren, Dana, Trevor and Justin to mourn Chloe's burial.

|-|Max sacrifices Arcadia Bay=Max sacrifices Arcadia Bay
If Max sacrifices Arcadia Bay, Victoria won't be seen again. As of *Life is Strange 2* she was confirmed to be one of the survivors of the storm.

## Alternative Timeline 
Victoria appears slightly different in the [Alternative Timeline](alternative_timeline.md); Max seems to have taken her place as the "Queen Bee" of Blackwell. In her texts, she seems concerned for Max's well being; although this could be attributed to her caring for Max as a social leader as opposed to a friend. However, she and Max seem to be close. They hang out frequently and are obviously into drugs, much like the rest of the Vortex Club in both timelines. Victoria also calls her Maxine and becomes worried when she is corrected with the "Max-never-Maxine" rule.
