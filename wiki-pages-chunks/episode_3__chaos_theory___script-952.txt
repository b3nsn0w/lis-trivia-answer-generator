Chloe's debt.Chloe's debt.**Max:** Could I get you to drop Chloe's debt?

**Frank:** Aren't you supposed to be a smart student?

**Max:** You'll find out if you do me this favor...

**Frank:** Thanks, Godmother. But I don't need your favors. And Chloe doesn't get any from me.

|-|David is after the gun. (Cop, determinant)# David is after the gun. (Cop, determinant)''Only available if Frank took the gun from Max in the previous episode and if Max spoke to the Cop about David.

**Max:** David Madsen is looking for that gun. He might show up on your RV step...

**Frank:** I'm trembling. I don't need to take his little museum piece.

|-|Buy drugs. (Nathan)Buy drugs. (Nathan)**Max:** By the way Frank... I was wondering if you had any... uh... "Higher Education."

**Frank:** Haha! Oh yeah, sure. Do you want "The Afterschool Special" to go with that? Jesus... Look, I don't sell anything but bottles to feed me and my dog. I work for a living, not like you spoiled Blackwell punks with too much time on your hands.

**Max:** But...

**Frank:** But nothing. Don't ever ask me for anything ever again. Ever. Now back off.

*Max rewinds.*

|-|Rachel's Photo. (Cop, Nathan)# Rachel's Photo. (Cop, Nathan)**Max:** You know, I saw that photo Rachel gave you.

**Frank:** Uh... How d'you know about that, huh? Chloe, right?

**Max:** She just told me that one of Rachel's favorite pictures was the one she did for you.

**Frank:** Really? Yeah, I mean that's what I thought. She was just a natural beauty, y'know. Wait—wait let me... lemme find it... here, judge for yourself.

|-|Saved dogs. (Cop, Nathan)Saved dogs. (Cop, Nathan)**Max:** You act so scary, but... you did save all those dogs...

**Frank:** One, I'm not acting. Two, who told you about the dogs?

**Max:** It's actually a great story. You're an animal lover. Could I pet the doggie? I could go grab him from your RV right now...

**Frank:** I won't even let you pick up the dog shit.

*Frank takes out his keys and places them on the table.*

**Frank:** Besides, you don't want a leash—you want these keys right here. Look at your eyes dilate. You're worse than a junkie, Max. But no fix for you.

*Max takes the keys.*

**Max:** I'm afraid I'll have to take your keys now, asshole.

**Frank, aggressively getting up:** You did not just do that...! Give me back my keys, bitch! Give me my keys now!

*Max rewinds.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Key brought, now back to Chloe.

*Max leaves the diner and sees Alyssa at the bus stop. A truck drives through the large puddle in front of her, drenching her in water.*

**Alyssa:** Are you shitting me?!

(Warn)# (Warn)

*Alyssa and Max both take a few steps back and wait for the truck to pass.*

**Alyssa:** Quick thinking, Max!

|-|(Don't warn)(Don't warn)

*If Max tries to speak to her:*

**Alyssa:** I'd love to talk Max, but I'm drowning in puddle scum.
