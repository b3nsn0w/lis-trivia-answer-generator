Here is a section of the wiki page for Victoria Chase:

## Friends 
*[Taylor Christensen](taylor_christensen.md) - They sit together in Jefferson's photography class, and next to Courtney, Taylor is not just one of the people she spends most of her time with, but also one of her closest friends. Compared to Courtney, Taylor seems to be more valued by Victoria, since they spend more time two by two without Courtney, and Victoria seeks comfort and support in Taylor after Kate's suicide attempt. Taylor obviously looks up to Victoria, always trying to impress her, and loves how she is an "evil bee-atch" (referring to her acting on Kate). Evidently, Victoria also cares a lot for Taylor, as she was there for her when her mother had back surgery.
*[Courtney Wagner](courtney_wagner.md) - She is one of her closest friends, always following her around like Taylor. Despite trying her best as one of Victoria's minions in order to be popular like her, she's obviously less valued by Victoria than Taylor. Courtney seems to do the dirty work for Victoria. For example, in Episode 2, when Max exits her room, she can see Victoria telling Courtney that she needs Courtney to bring her papers before tonight, while Taylor is listening to music with Victoria in her dorm room. Max believes that Courtney wrote an essay for her in Mr. Jefferson's class when she sneaks into Victoria's room. In Episode 4, Victoria and Taylor are partying in the VIP section of the Vortex Club party, while Courtney is chosen to guard the VIP section.
*[Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md) - Known as the "King and Queen" of the Vortex Club and popular long-term members, they've spent a lot of time together and became supposedly very close. Victoria states herself that Nathan is one of her best friends, though he is her seemingly only closest friendship that is based on mutual respect (evident by Taylor and Courtney considered Victoria's "minions"). A photo of both of them fooling around and several party shots, as well as a lot of exchanged emails, which can be found in Victoria's room, prove their familiarity. DONTNOD has stated that their relationship is ambiguous (insert ref), thus open for debate if it's friendship or something more. Victoria seems to know Nathan better than anyone as she states he wouldn't be what everyone believes him to be, and that nobody really knows what he's actually going through. She evidently knows about his mental problems and how his family treats him, and from that, it's evident that Nathan trusted Victoria a lot and confided his struggles to her, since she clearly was someone who listened to him and tried to support him through his hard time. Nathan, for his part, also really seems to care for Victoria. When Victoria cries after Kate's suicide (attempt) he visits her in her room possibly to comfort her given the situation. He's also seen to defend her if Max took the picture of Victoria covered in paint. Despite this, she mentions that he has been "freaking her out" lately, regardless of their friendship status, which proves that his mental state had become more unstable and although Victoria had tried to support him, she was unable to cope with his behavior.
*[Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) (**Determinant**) - Although she frequently picks on Max, if Max comforted her earlier, she reveals a more vulnerable and kind side to her, and admits her jealousy of Max, who she thinks is actually, despite her awkwardness, one of the coolest people in Blackwell for not caring what other people think. She may be appealed by their shared similarities in art and photography, and acknowledge that their personalities are more alike than it seems, and that they could get along fine if they hung out. Victoria may also admit that she really would like to hang out with her, and that she almost asked her out if Max called her photos "Avedon-esque" in episode one. Considering her own social status, she thinks it's not possible for them to be friends, but she hopes Max would get into the Vortex Club one day so that it would be less weird for them hanging out. She may also appreciate Max's warnings regarding Nathan and offer Max to text her if she needs anything. However, this leads to Victoria kidnapped into the Dark Room and eventually killed.  
*Other [Vortex Club](vortex_club_members.md) - TBA
