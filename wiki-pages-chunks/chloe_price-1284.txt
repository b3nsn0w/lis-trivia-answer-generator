Here is a section of the wiki page for Chloe Price:

## Chloe # 
Chloe's previous history as an archetypal punk rocker has seemingly been wiped out completely in the new timeline Max created in "Chaos Theory" by preventing the death of Chloe's father, William. She is now restricted to an electric wheelchair which assists with movement, as well as being dependent on a breathing apparatus. This is due to a car accident that Chloe was involved in sometime before March 2011This is evident from a [Media:Note4-altgarage-wellsletter.png](letter.md) from Principal Wells that can be found in alternative Chloe's room, written in August 2011, in which he suggests that it would be better regarding her handicap to attend another school.  after William had bought her a vehicle for her 16th birthday. An SUV cut her off, and she crashed, tragically snapping her spine and paralyzing herself.Chloe's handicap is foreshadowed during the previous episodes. Chloe parks two times on a handicapped parking spot and later even steals money for the Blackwell's Handicapped Fund. Chloe also has severe troubles with her respiratory system, and is deteriorating quickly. The complete collapse of her respiratory system is inevitable, according to her doctor. Her parents decide not to tell her, ignoring the advice of the doctor. However, Chloe is fully aware of the situation, having heard the doctors discussing it while she was pretending to be asleep.

She is still a punk at heart, visiting websites for local rock shows and looking at magazines related to punk music and style. She has an old, spiked bracelet on her desk, reminiscent of the old Chloe.

Chloe refers to herself as a science nerd and got straight A's before her accident.Discovered from Chloe's Report Card in her garage bedroom. We know that she was unable to keep attending Blackwell Academy due to the lack of disability access available around the historic campus. Principal Wells suggested that she go to a different school, as evident from his [Media:Note4-altgarage-wellsletter.png](letter.md) to Chloe's parents dated the 8th of August 2011.

In this timeline, Chloe collects snow domesNext to the one of the doe, there are also... and is still in possession of the snow dome that features a [doe](doe.md) which Max may or may not have smashed in the original timeline when she was being nosy in Chloe's room at the beginning of the week. She also enjoys fluffy, cuddly toys and has high-tech equipment for communicating online and sending text messages. Her room is decorated very differently; the walls are serene and no longer messy. Her inability to physically write on her walls is probably the cause, as she admits that sometimes she purposely rebels against her parents just, so they will shout at her instead of treating her like a baby. She seems unhappy that she can't go "party like a rock star" or get into any "teen trouble" with her folks. A picture of angels with the word "faith" above it suggests Chloe or her parents are hopeful and possibly turning in small part to religion for guidance through their rough time.

This Chloe doesn't blame anyone for her condition, even though she had the right. She isn't angry at her parents or at Max, just grateful to be alive and to have her family watching over her.

## Chloe's Family # 
Chloe is aware that her accident has taken a huge toll on her family and that her parents are struggling to cope with the medical bills in addition to their daughter's disability. Her mother is coping badly, glad that her cheery, hopeful husband is there to help. Her hope for the future seems to be gone entirely, knowing her daughter is going to die.Color symbolism is important here, as her hair clip which was always previously blue (symbolizing hope for the future) is now a dull pink. William and Chloe remain closer than ever; something which will hurt him extremely when she dies. His guilt about her accident still affects the family, as his purchasing of the car led to Chloe's accident in the first place.  

Chloe's Uncle Aaron, William's brother, seems apologetic that he cannot help the family more, and like most other people in Chloe's life, failed to keep in touch regularly with the family, albeit this was due to his career. He sends a letter to William about this, which sits in Chloe's old room. 

Chloe's parents also received a letter from Joyce's Aunt Dorothy who cannot financially assist them due to dealing with her own medical bills.

## Chloe's Friends # 
Chloe is extremely happy to see Max, unlike in the original timeline in which she was accusatory about Max abandoning her.In contrast to the original timeline where Max has to convince Chloe that all that matters is that she's still there in Acadia Bay, alive and together with her friend ("You don't want to hear this, but you're still here. Alive. With me."), the alternative Chloe says herself, "At least I'm here alive with you." This is rather odd, as Max still did not visit Chloe in the alternative timeline, only sending her letters, the occasional text and a selfie of her on a road trip. It can be discovered through conversation that she was a little hurt by Max not visiting; but she understands, commenting that her friend isn't "SuperMax."This is a sad contradiction of her compliments about Max's powers. Chloe fondly refers to her as "SuperMax" outside this alternative timeline. Chloe still considers Max as her best friend, still cherishing their childhood memories a lot and chooses to have Max's company as her last good memory. She reveals that most of her other friends failed to keep in touch, including another girl, [Megan Weaver](megan_weaver.md), who was her particular friend. Megan sends her a postcard wishing her well.  

She seems to have many online friends after joining the "Hawt Wheels Chat Room" as "Miss Blue."

Without frequenting Blackwell, Chloe has never met Rachel Amber in the alternative timeline and does not even know her name until Max tells her.
