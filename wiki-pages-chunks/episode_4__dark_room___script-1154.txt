## **Alternative Beach** 
*Max walks next to Chloe as they stroll down the path next to the beach.*

**Chloe: **It's weird hanging out with you again.

**Max: **I know... I'm glad we are, though.

**Chloe: **It was nice that you sent me actual letters. That's more than any of my other friends have done... And you even wrote on that cool parchment paper. That's so Max.

**Max: **So pretentious. But I love writing on it, like an English poet. You deserve the best stationery.

**Chloe: **Probably easier to write than to visit me. I don't mean that in a bitchy way. Not totally. You probably wanted to avoid awkward conversations like this.

**Max: **Uh...pretty much, yeah.

**Chloe: **Look, the worst thing you can do is treat me like a baby. I still want to laugh and talk shit with my best friend. Can we stop? This is seriously the best view of the sunset. What do photographers call that?

**Max: **"The golden hour."

**Chloe: **See? Without you here, I'd have no clue. Bet you could take some amazing shots... Those beached whales are so sad. I kind of know how they feel... At least I'm alive here with you.

**Max: **You're a real survivor, Chloe. I know you have to deal with so much.

**Chloe: **I don't want anybody else feeling sorry for me. I can do that...along with my parents. My dad still feels guilty about buying me that car.

Talk about accident?# Talk about accident?**Max:** Are you okay to talk about the accident?

**Chloe:** We never actually have, huh? There's not much to say. Some prick in an SUV cut me off and I flew into a ditch.

|-|Blame William?Blame William?**Max:** You don't really blame William...do you?

**Chloe:** For getting me the hybrid I wanted for my sweet sixteen? No, I blame the asshole who cut me off and sent me into a ditch.

**Max: **Do you...remember everything?

**Chloe: **I saw everything in bullet time. I felt my back snap and... And that was the last thing I ever felt in my body. When I woke up in the hospital, I literally couldn't move a muscle.

**Max: **Jesus! I...I don't know what to say.

**Chloe: **Don't say anything. I'm just happy I did get to see you again. I could have ended up vanishing out of the blue like that girl from Blackwell.

You mean Rachel?# You mean Rachel?**Max:** You mean Rachel Amber? When was the last time you talked to her?

**Chloe:** Uh, never. I just read about her in the news. I didn't even know her name. You did?

|-|What missing girl?What missing girl?**Max:** What missing girl?

**Chloe:** I don't know her name, just read about it in the news. I feel bad for her family.

**Max: **This is such a different world than when we were kids, isn't it...

**Chloe: **After that snow and eclipse, it's more like the end of the world.

You think?# You think?**Max:** Do you think so? I haven't kept up with the details.

**Chloe:** I have more time on my hands than you... Plus I'm a science nerd. But none of this makes sense.

|-|It might be.It might be.**Max:** It might be, but...I'd like to think we can still change things for the better.

**Chloe:** I'd like to think that too...but I don't have much hope these days.

|-|Don't say that.# Don't say that.**Max:** Don't say that.

**Chloe:** Not trying to bum you out. It just seems like Arcadia Bay is having a meltdown.

**Max: **I know things seem out of control, but...as long as we're together, I don't feel afraid.

**Chloe: **Hanging out with you makes me feel like a total kid again. You don't even know...

**Max: **Listen, Chloe...I'm sorry I haven't been out to see you more. That was wrong. You're my best friend.

**Chloe: **Max, thanks for coming out to see me. You're...you're doing awesome.

**Max: **I don't think so.

**Chloe: **Um. My...my nose is getting cold. Maybe we should get back to my place.

**Max: **It is hella cold out here.

**Chloe: **"Hella"? I hate that word, no offense.

**Max: **None taken.

''Max and Chloe turn around and head back towards Chloe's house.*
