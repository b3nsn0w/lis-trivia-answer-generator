Here is a section of the wiki page for Episode 5: Polarized - Script:

posed like this for Frank... or wrote him love letters... I can't believe she was banging Frank! Rachel straight up lied to my face! Why didn't she say anything?

**Max:** Because she knew how you would react.

**Chloe:** Then she wasn't much of a friend, huh? Just another person who shits all over me. Why does everybody in my life let me down? My dad gets killed, you bail on me for years, my mother gloms onto step-fucker... now Rachel betrays me...

**Saving William**

**Chloe:** Not until I see it first! You know the rules, Dad! Dude, I am so lucky that my father is cool... Max, you are being so fucking strange. You feel okay?

**Max:** Chloe, I am... awesome. We are awesome!

**The Beach with Alternate Chloe**

**Alternate Chloe:** It’s weird hanging out with you again.

**Max:** I know... I’m glad we are, though.

**Alternate Chloe:** Look, the worst thing you can do is treat me like a baby. I still want to laugh and talk shit with my best friend. Can we stop? This is seriously the best view of the sunset. What do photographers call that?

**Max:** "The golden hour."

'''Alternate Chloe's Room**

**Alternate Chloe:** Whoa, awesome picture. We look so badass in our pirate gear.

**Max:** We should have taken over Arcadia Bay when we had the chance.

**Alternate Chloe:''' Listen, Max, my respiratory system is failing and... and it's only getting worse. I've heard the doctors talking about it when they thought I was zonked out. So I know I'm just putting off the inevitable, while my parents suffer along... and I will, too. This isn't how I want things to end.

**Max:** What? What are you saying?

**Alternate Chloe:** I'm saying that being with you again has been so special. I just wanted to feel like when we were kids running around Arcadia Bay... and everything was possible. And you made me feel that way today. I want this time with you to be my last memory... Do you understand?

**Working on the Detective Board**

**Max:** Chloe... you're back. I'm just... I'm just—I'm so glad you're here!

**Chloe:** You sound high, but thanks for the morning grope. Since we were up all night playing "CSI: Arcadia Bay," I was still spaced out here, trying to put all this info together.

**The Dark Room**

**Max:** Kate wasn't the first... All those binders are filled with other victims. Victoria has to be next. Nathan must be planning to dose her tonight at the Vortex Club party.

**Chloe:** Rachel... This can't be real... These are all—these are all posed shots, right? Right? The junkyard! Max, we have to find that spot, now! Then we can see what he did... There's no way she's dead. No way! She posed for those pictures, Max. I know it, please... let's go.

'''Finding Rachel's Body**

**Chloe:'* *(sobbing)* Rachel... Oh, Rachel... No... no... Please, not her...

**Max:** Chloe...

**Chloe:** Rachel... why?

**Max:** *(sobbing)'' I’m sorry, Chloe. I’m so sorry...

**Chloe:** I loved her so much... How can she be dead? What kind of world does this? Who does this?!

**Reaching the Lighthouse**

**Chloe:** Come on Max, we’re almost there! Please wake up! Max, can you hear me? Hang on, Max, we can make it! Listen to me! Max! We’re near the lighthouse! Wake up! Dammit, Max, don't let me down!

*Max fights her way through the storm and catches up to reality.*

**Chloe:** Max, come on now! Don't worry... we'll be okay.
