## Office
[File:2012_Otters_Swim_Team_Poster_Office.png](thumb.md) Inside the office is a desk with various stationery and a jack-o'-lantern. Next to the entrance is a large window overlooking the pool and a table with a coffee maker, an observable coffee cup, and drawers that Max can search to find an Otters 2012 swim team poster. There is also the switch to the lights of the pool, a whiteboard showing the goals of the swim team, and practice dummies.

## Entrance
In the entrance, there are two vending machines with one for drinks and one for snacks. Doors to the office and girls' and boys' locker rooms are on either side and at the end of the small corridor. There is a bulletin board with two ads for missing and stolen items as well as one flier about climate change. One of the stolen items is a backpack containing a tablet with pictures of a late cat on it. Please view [Easter Eggs (Life is Strange)#Cat_Pics](this_article.md) for more info about the cat pics.
