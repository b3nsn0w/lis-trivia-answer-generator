Here is a section of the wiki page for Chloe Price:

## Trivia 
*Chloe's shirt in Episode 1 is possibly a reference to the famous punk band [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misfits_(band) Misfits], seeing as they share names and that the band's popular logo is a skull, and Chloe's shirt reads "Misfit skull".
*Chloe is apparently left-handed, confirmed by Co-Game Director [Michel Koch](michel_koch.md).[https://twitter.com/original_Pantsu/status/635563570982481921 Twitter post with Michel Koch's confirmation] 
*Chloe's zodiac sign is Pisces.
*Chloe is revealed to have a belly button piercing, as seen in the swimming pool scene in Episode 3. The piercing seems to be a navel barrel, also called a "bananabell", the most common kind of piercing for navels.
*Chloe's address is 44 Cedar Ave, as evident from several postcards. 
*Chloe can die or have close encounters with death in all episodes except "Chaos Theory".
*Chloe admits she went to counseling/therapy in the past, but no longer goes because she didn't like what her counselor had to say.During the meeting on the Main Campus in Episode 3, if you choose "Don't joke" from the three options, Chloe will say: "Max, I'm not laughing at you. My old counselor told me that my sarcasm was a way of "avoidance." That's why he's my ex-counselor."
*Chloe's catch phrase "hella" is used 13 times by herself during the whole game.Fun fact: "Hella" was adapted to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary as a slang-term for "very, extremely" on April 27, 2016.
*[Chloe's Truck](chloe_s_car.md) is most likely the 7th generation of Ford F-150.Discussion: http://www.igcd.net/vehicle.php?id70531
*Chloe's car's license plate spells "TWN PKS", which is a reference to *{{Wiki|Twin Peaks}}*, an American television serial drama, which also takes place in Pacific Northwest and is centered around the mysterious disappearance of a well liked teenage girl prior to the series start. There are also two hills in San Francisco (the city where her parents took a photo together when Joyce was expecting Chloe) with the same name. It is a very prominent tourist attraction.Several references to *Twin Peaks* can be found in Life is Strange as it heavily influenced the game's story. See [References (Life is Strange)#Twin Peaks](here.md) for a full list of references.
*Chloe seems to care about animals, as Max states she would never use animal products. Despite this, Chloe can be seen eating bacon at the diner in Episode 2. 
*Chloe doesn't like to use emojis, as she frequently reminds Max of not using them herself, which is probably due to her depression and resentfulness. However, she does use emoji in the timeline Max causes in "Polarized" where Max won the Everyday Heroes Contest and Chloe recognized her step-father's goodwill after he captured Jefferson.
*It's implied that Chloe is patriotic since she has a U.S. flag hanging in front of her room's window. However, the flag is turned upside down, which is a symbol of resistance towards authority and/or distress. There are other indications like a drawing which depicts Max and Chloe on an adventure accompanied by the "freedom eagle".
* Quite a few things about the Alternative Chloe Price's life and personality are ironic inversions or distortions of her mainline counterparts.
* In Episode 1, Chloe parks her truck across two disability parking spaces. In Episode 3, she wants to steal money from the school's disability fund. In the [Alternative Timeline (Life is Strange)](alternative_timeline.md) Max creates at the end of the episode, she's a quadriplegic, and suffering the repercussions of the school's undersized disability fund (a letter from the principal recommends she transfer schools because Blackwell can't afford to make all its buildings wheelchair-accessible).
* In the main timeline, Chloe is a disruptive high school dropout and a street punk. In the alternative timeline, she's a well-behaved straight-A student and a science geek.
* Mainline Chloe often calls Max "Super Max" because of her time travel powers, which adds a little bit of extra sting when Alternative Chloe tries to placate Max for being unable to do more by telling her she can't always be Super Max.
* Alternative timeline Chloe never met Rachel Amber, and therefore seems relatively unconcerned about her disappearance beyond reflecting on how sad it must be for her parents.
* The main timeline's Chloe is a casual drug user who sometimes uses "medicating" as a euphemism for getting high, and her stepfather disapproves of her habit. Alternative timeline Chloe is dependent on medically-prescribed regular doses of morphine to fight off the pain of her injuries, and her father has gone deeply into debt to provide this along with her other medical expenses.
* Max has been spending so much time and effort to save Chloe from both death and her feelings of abandonment. Alternative Chloe's final request is to have Max euthanize her, and she'll call Max out for abandoning her if she can't go through with it.
*Chloe has always wanted blue bangs like Pris from *{{Wiki|Blade Runner}}* who inspired her to color her hair in the first place (this is said by Alternative Chloe, but Pris never actually had blue bangs).

*A number of inconsistencies exist between Chloe's height chart from the normal timeline and her height chart in the alternative timeline.
*Chloe has always loved manga, at least until she was 14, as mentioned by Max when she comments on a manga magazine in 2008.*"Chloe was so into manga... nice hair!"*
*Chloe and Max's favorite childhood series include *{{Wiki|Spongebob}}*Max on page
