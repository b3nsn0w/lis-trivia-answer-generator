Here is a section of the wiki page for Mark Jefferson:

## Associated Deaths 
* [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md) (**Indirectly Caused/Intended, Determinant**) - Kate was dosed at a Vortex Club party by Nathan Prescott with the purpose of being taken to the Dark Room. Jefferson took photos of her while she was drugged, contributing to her feeling of "being dirty" which, along with the party video of her kissing people while being dosed and the bullying resulting of said video going viral, was part of the reason for Kate's suicide (attempt, unless she was saved by the player). In Episode 2, he tries to gaslight Kate not taking her worried confession of her unhappiness seriously. If Max manages to stop Kate from committing suicide, Jefferson will later imply to Max that he plans to kill her.
* [Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md) (**Indirectly Caused, Involved**) - Jefferson was involved in the coercion and kidnapping of Rachel Amber, which led to her accidental overdose caused by Nathan Prescott.
* [Chloe Price](chloe_price.md) (**Caused, Direct**) - Jefferson shot Chloe in the head after sedating Max with a needle, causing her to be unable to use her rewind.
* [Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md) (**Caused, Direct**) - Mark informed Max that Nathan was a flight risk and he could not "keep him as a protégé" for much longer after Rachel's overdose. Jefferson says to Max that he is "dead and buried."
* [Victoria Chase](victoria_chase.md) (**Caused, Direct, Determinant**) - After Max's return from the timeline in which Mr. Jefferson is arrested before her capture and she is sent on the "Everyday Heroes" trip, if Victoria believed Max's warning and was kidnapped by Mr. Jefferson, he informs Max that he "had to let Victoria Chase go", keeping it vague at first until Max's hope of her being alive were sparked to which he corrected in saying, "Don't be stupid, okay? She is exactly where she deserves to be."
* [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) (**Potential (Alternative Timeline), Intended**) - Jefferson had intended to kill Max after he finished photographing her in the Dark Room. If Max warns David too early then Jefferson attacks her with a tripod, forcing her to rewind.
* [David Madsen](david_madsen.md) (**Potential (Alternative Timeline), Intended**) - Once David entered the Dark Room to find any surviving Dark Room victims (Max) and apprehend Jefferson, Jefferson tried to kill him. In the first course of events without Max rewinding and asking for a last wish from Jefferson, Jefferson will bludgeon David unconscious or dead with the camera tripod. Jefferson will also reach for a gun and shoot David dead after David manages to disarm Jefferson and cause him to drop his tripod. With the aid of Max's ability, after several trial and errors, David will finally overpower Jefferson. David may also get a scar on his forehead during the fight with Mark Jefferson.

## Relationships 

#

## Friends 
* [Raymond Wells](principal_wells.md) - Throughout the game, it seemed that Wells and Jefferson were on good terms together. In reality, Jefferson only saw Wells as a drunk foolish headmaster, as he revealed in "Polarized".If you blamed Jefferson in Episode 2, while having a conversation about Kate, he will say to Max: "When you told the principal that I made Kate cry, I thought you almost had me. It's good our esteemed Principal Wells is, like most administrators... a closet drunk..."
* [Sean Prescott](sean_prescott.md) - The depth of Jefferson's relationship with the Prescotts is unknown. There appears to be, to some extent, a level of trust the Prescotts have/had for Jefferson by allowing him to mentor Nathan and giving him access to their fortune. Jefferson also had hold of personal information regarding the Prescotts and their history. Despite all of this, Jefferson does not seem to hold the Prescotts in high regard and mainly sees them as a tool to get what he wants. Principal Wells reveals in "Polarized" that Sean was the very person who gave Jefferson a position at Blackwell.
* [Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md) - Jefferson was his mentor and father figure. At the start of their student-teacher relationship, Jefferson found it quite touching but he eventually became irritated and annoyed with Nathan's incompetence. After Nathan, *according to Jefferson*, accidentally overdosed Rachel Amber and probably messed up the kidnapping of Kate Marsh by giving her too low of a dose, he decided to get rid of Nathan and began to plan his elimination. This could also be an excuse to eliminate him because he knew the most about the Dark Room; as Nathan is known to be quite unpredictable and this would increase the threat of him being exposed. If Max claims to have cared more about Nathan than he did, Jefferson will get furious and deny this. This may indicate that he did care about Nathan.*(See [Nathan and Jefferson](here.md) for more information on their relationship.)*
