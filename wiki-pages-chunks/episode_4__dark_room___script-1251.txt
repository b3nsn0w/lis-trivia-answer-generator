Here is a section of the wiki page for Episode 4: Dark Room - Script:

## **Junkyard**

''Max runs back to Chloe's truck and they drive to the junkyard. Chloe brings her truck to a stop, opens her door, and runs. Max follows.''

**Max:** Chloe, slow down! Wait for me!

**Chloe:** I know exactly where I'm going!

''Chloe runs to the corner of the junkyard near the Steve's Famous Crab sign.*

**Chloe: **Look, this is it! This is it!

*Chloe begins to dig with her hands.*

**Chloe: **Are you going to help me, Max?

**Max: **Chloe, stop! Look!

**Chloe: **Please, no...

**Max: **That smell...

**Chloe: **Rachel... Oh, Rachel, no, no! Please, not her!

*Max covers her mouth with her hands as she watches Chloe's reaction. Chloe moves a few feet away and begins to gag. Max runs over to Chloe and puts one hand on her shoulder and another hand on her back, trying to comfort her.''

**Max: **Chloe...

**Chloe: **Rachel... why?

**Max: **I'm sorry, Chloe. I'm so sorry...

''Chloe hugs her knees to her chest, sobbing, and covers her face with her hand. Max puts her hands on Chloe's shoulders and hugs her.*

**Chloe: **I loved her so much... How can she be dead? What kind of world does this? Who does this?

*A spiritual deer watches them from across the junkyard. Gradually, it fades away.*

## **Parking Lot**

*Max and Chloe sit in the truck.''

**Chloe: **I hope Nathan enjoys his last party.

**Max: **Chloe, we can go right to the cops. We have proof.

**Chloe: **Fuck the police. Rachel wanted us to find her. So we could get real justice... and revenge. The Prescotts have had this coming for a hundred years, and nobody is going to get in my way. Especially with your help... right?

**Max: **I'm with you to the end, Chloe. You know that.

*Chloe looks down at her gun and puts it in her back pocket. They get out of the car.*

**Boy: **Oh, shit, this is like that eclipse.

**Girl: **You're right. Look at the outline.

**Boy: **I can't tell if they're different.

**Girl: **There can't be two moons... that's not possible...

*Max looks up at the sky to see two moons.*

**Max: **What is that? Jesus, Chloe, look up at the sky!

**Chloe: **Beautiful, I don't give a shit. The world is ending, cool.

**Max: **You're not listening! Something major is going down!

**Chloe: **That's right. Nathan Prescott is going down.

*Chloe and Max start to walk towards the building. Warren stops them.*

**Warren: **Welcome to the end of the world, ladies. I'm glad you decided to escort me...

**Max: **You look really good, Warren. Are you all right after today?

(Max stopped Warren from beating Nathan)# (Max stopped Warren from beating Nathan)

**Warren: **I'm glad you stopped me... Nathan is dangerous.

|-|(Warren beat up Nathan)(Warren beat up Nathan)

**Warren: **I really flipped out on Nathan. I just hate bullies... and Max, he's dangerous.

**Chloe: **Where is he?

**Warren: **I didn't see him at the dorm again. I was holed up in my room.

**Max: **Dude, have you been drinking?

**Warren: **Well, if you consider half a beer "drinking"...

**Chloe: **Let's go, Max.

**Warren: **Hey, hey... I know this is a bad time, but can I get one picture? I've been feeling like this might be actually the end of the world, so... I want to have something for prosperity.

**Max: **Well... I don't blame you, Warren.

**Warren: **I know, I know, I'm a pain in the booty. Just one picture. Uh...

**Max: **Action.

''Warren uses Max's camera to take a polaroid of the two of them together.''

**Chloe: **We got no time for this shit. Come on, Max.

**Warren: **Sorry... I just wanted to feel like a normal student after this week's ultraviolence. I never hit anybody like that before... I was always the one getting my ass kicked.

**Max: **Hey, we still need your expert help. If you see Nathan, text me immediately, okay? And do not let him see you.

**Warren: **He won't. I know how to be invisible here...

**Max: **Not to me, Warren. Text soon.
