*Max puts the photo on the desk.*

**Max:** Here's a photo I took of David and Kate yesterday.

**David:** That's not—not proof.

**Principal Wells:** Hold on, this isn't a courtroom. But I feel it would be in the best interest of Blackwell and this situation to put you on temporary leave... We will continue this conversation later.

**David:** Are you fucking kidding me? This is major bullshit! I led troops into battle and you're letting this punk lead you?

**Principal Wells:** No. I am sorry, David...

{{!}}-{{!}}Intervened# Intervened**Max:** And he should take the word of somebody who harasses students?

**Principal Wells:** Max, I'm afraid this won't be solved here without proof and a thorough investigation. Now, if you have anything else to say...

I'll have to investigate to see if this accusation is true. Therefore Max, I'm obliged to contact your parents and suspend you for a few days.

**Jefferson:** Excuse me, I think Max and Nathan need a break before we grill them further.

{{#tag:tabber|Saved Kate# Saved Kate**Jefferson:** A friend and student just tried to kill herself... They don't need this forum right now.

**Nathan:** Yes, I'm kinda devastated right now. I'd like to be with my family.

|-|JEFFERSON MADE HER CRY# JEFFERSON MADE HER CRY**Max:** I saw Mr. Jefferson talking to Kate right before our class... then she ran off crying...

**Principal Wells:** Mark, I do know that Miss Marsh has assisted you on class events.

**Jefferson:** Kate... Miss Marsh... has been very withdrawn lately. And I assume this awful video was the cause. I hated seeing the students laugh at her.

{{#tag:tabber|Answered Kate's phone callAnswered Kate's phone call**Jefferson:** She told me Max was the only one who believed her, would take her calls and actually listen to her.

{{!}}-{{!}}Ignored Kate's phone call# Ignored Kate's phone call**Jefferson:** She was upset Miss Caulfield didn't return her calls. She felt rejected by the school...

**Nathan:** She shouldn't have asked to be on video macking with some dudes...

**Max:** You ass. She didn't ask for any of this...

**Jefferson:** No, on the contrary. Max was right to bring this up. Now, I wanted to help, but I guess I was too late...

**Principal Wells:** Well now, this is problematic. The publicity is rising and perhaps... you shouldn't represent Blackwell at the "Everyday Heroes" contest in San Francisco...

**Jefferson:** Are you serious?

**Principal Wells:** I am. We don't need any negative press about that event. And we need to involve the Academy in possible disciplinarian measures for you.

**Jefferson:** I understand. There are bigger things at stake than me. The life of a young girl for one...

{{#tag:tabber|Told Jefferson about DavidTold Jefferson about David*David scoffs.*

**Jefferson:** Maybe you should investigate other staff members? Max told me she knew things about Mr. Madsen...

**Principal Wells:** Let Max speak for herself. Everything we talked about here will be looked into.
