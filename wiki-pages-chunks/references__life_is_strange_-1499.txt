Here is a section of the wiki page for References (Life is Strange):

## Chloe Price 
* [Chloe Price](chloe_price.md)'s character might be based on {{Wiki|Lisbeth Salander}} from *{{Wiki|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (disambiguation)|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo}}*. The female protagonist has a very similar attitude and punk rock style like Chloe; she has the same badass attitude, short colored hair, tattoos and piercings, wears boots and skull motifs. A poster in Chloe's room looks identical to the one used in a promo for the American movie. Chloe's skull shirt from Episode 1 closely resembles the skull motif on Lisbeth's shirt in the Swedish version. Though it's not directly linked to Chloe, Rachel's dragon tattoo is very similar to the dragon image on the Swedish version's film cover.
* Chloe might also be based on Emma from the French graphic novel and film *{{Wiki|Blue Is the Warmest Color (comics)|Blue is the Warmest Color}}*. Both characters are punkish, rebellious teenage girls with short blue hair and are queer who falls in with a girl who is seen as their opposite in personality. The graphic novel versions of their retrospective characters look nearly identical.
* It's possible that Chloe is partly inspired by the protagonist of the old animated MTV series *Daria*. Daria Morgendorffer is a smart, acerbic, and somewhat misanthropic teenage girl who observes the world around her. The phrase "Everybody Lies, No Exceptions" that is written on Chloe's wall is a line from the old animated MTV series *Daria*. Chloe is even drawn in a cool little Daria style next to it.

## Mark Jefferson 
* [Mark Jefferson](mark_jefferson.md)'s character is possibly based on Patrick Wilson's character Jeff Kohlver from the movie *{{Wiki|Hard_Candy_(film)|Hard Candy}}*. In the movie, Jeff Kohlver is a pedophile who lures teenage girls back to his apartment under the pretense of doing modeling for him. He then uses that opportunity to take advantage of them. Later in the movie, Jeff admits to photographing another man as he raped and killed another girl. Both Mr. Jefferson and Jeff Kohlver are stylish, charismatic men in their early thirties with careers in photography. Their appearances are very similar - both have short brown hair, light beards, and are in good shape for their age. They both also wear thick-framed glasses and smart casual clothing such as suit jackets. Jeff Kohlver's plans are ultimately foiled by 14-year-old Hayley Stark, echoing Mr. Jefferson's downfall at the hands of Max.
* Jefferson's name might be based on {{Wiki|Mark Jefferson (geographer)|an American geographer and cartographer}} or {{Wiki|Mark Jefferson (cricketer)|a New Zealand cricketer}} who are both called Mark Jefferson.

#

## Victoria Chase 
* It is possible that the name "[Victoria Chase](victoria_chase.md)" was chosen as a nod towards {{Wiki|Joss Whedon}}, given that Victoria has the same name as and fills an equivalent role to character {{Wiki|Cordelia Chase}} from *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*.

#

## Warren Graham 
*According to Artistic Director Michel Koch, [Warren Graham](warren_graham.md)'s character is inspired by {{Wiki|Xander Harris}} from *Buffy the Vampire Slayer* who "has this kind of awkwardness in him and is always saying the wrong things, but he's a good guy".[http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/first-love-and-awkwardness-inside-the-mind-of-life-is-strange-co-director-michel-koch-423 First Love and Awkwardness: Inside the Mind of ‘Life Is Strange’ Co-Director Michel Koch] (August 4, 2015)

#

## Kate Marsh 
* The combination of [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md) 's middle and last name may be a reference to the character Beverly Marsh in {{Wiki|Stephen King}}'s *{{Wiki|It (novel)|IT}}*.
* Kate's rabbit [Alice the Rabbit](alice.md) may have been a reference to the white rabbit in *{{Wiki|Alice in Wonderland}}* that leads Alice to Wonderland.

#

## Zachary Riggins 
*[Zachary Riggins](zachary_riggins.md) 's last name, "Riggins" is a reference to NBC primetime drama, *Friday Night Lights*. [Mark Jefferson](mark_jefferson.md)' s voice actor, [Derek Phillips](derek_phillips.md)  starred in the series as a character named Billy Riggins.

#

## Frank Bowers 
*[File:Hitman from Mulholland Drive - Frank Bowers.jpg](thumb.md) [Frank Bowers](frank_bowers.md) seems to be modeled after the Hitman from *Mulholland Drive*.
*His last name may be a reference to {{Wiki|Stephen King}}'s* {{Wiki|It (novel)|IT}}* where the leader of the bullies is named Henry Bowers. Frank's first name is believed to be a reference to "[w:c:villains:Frank (Donnie Darko)](frank_the_rabbit.md)" from *Donnie Darko*.
* Frank's RV has the number plate "BRKBD", a reference to the television show *{{Wiki|Breaking Bad}}*, in which drug dealer Walter and his accomplice Jesse cook Crystal Meth in an RV.

#

## David Madsen 
*[David Madsen](david_madsen.md)'s character design may be based on a composite sketch from the first season of the *X-Files* which very closely resembles David's faceSee here for a comparison: [http://lifeisstrangegame.tumblr.com/post/119525570124/shutupandtakethisurl-i-was-watching-x-files http://lifeisstrangegame.tumblr.com/post/119525570124/shutupandtakethis]. It's pretty likely since Artistic Director Michel Koch is a big fan of this series and there are several other references throughout the game.

#

## Dana Ward 
*[Dana Ward](dana_ward.md)'s first name might be a reference to the main character Dana Scully from the TV series *X-Files*.

#

## Samuel Taylor 
*[Samuel Taylor](samuel_taylor.md)'s character may be an analog to the character of the Log Lady in *Twin Peaks*. Like the Log Lady, Samuel is seen as a strange, creepy, or quirky character, and has a seemly supernatural connection to the town with uncanny insight into its mysteries.
