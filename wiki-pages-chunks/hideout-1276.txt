> This looks like a graffiti museum for Chloe and Rachel... I bet I can find out more about Rachel here...

**[Maxine Caulfield**, Max Caulfield](maxine_caulfield____max_caulfield.md)'s monologue in "[Episode 2: Out of Time, Out of Time](episode_2__out_of_time__out_of_time.md)"

The **Hideout** is a brick building in the [American Rust Junkyard](american_rust_junkyard.md). [Chloe Price](chloe_price.md) and [Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md) used to hang out in there a lot, and there are now several mementos and photos from their time together. It's an explorable location in *[Life is Strange](life_is_strange.md)*, and is featured again in the prequel *[Life is Strange: Before the Storm](before_the_storm.md)*. [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) may enter it when she visits the junkyard in Episodes 2 and 4.

## Overview 
[File:full interior view.jpg](300px.md)
The hideout is half-built, missing a door and using slate and wooden planks for a roof. One of the windows looks to the train tracks. The walls are covered with graffiti and posters, showcasing Chloe and Rachel's dream of going to [Los Angeles](los_angeles.md) one day. Empty pizza boxes and beer bottles are scattered around. Other items include several car number plates, a dartboard and a [Vortex Club](vortex_club.md) party flyer. There is also a spool table with makeup, which was likely used more by Rachel than Chloe. A big yellow carpet with an image of an elephant between two palm trees hangs in front of the spool table.

After Rachel's disappearance, Chloe has added a graffiti saying "Fuck you, yes you", as well as wrote "I WANT TO DIE" on a sheet of paper. She also defaced the "Welcome to L.A" poster, replacing "L.A" with "HELL". Â The yellow carpet has been pierced with bullets, although it is unknown whether this was done before or after Rachel went missing.

## Episode Two - "[Episode 2: Out of Time](out_of_time.md)" 
Max comes across the hideout while searching for 5 beer bottles to bring to Chloe. Upon entering, she calls it a "graffiti museum" and thinks she can find out more about Rachel there. The beer bottle stands on a chair. Max can add her name to the graffiti on the wall to indicate she was here along with Chloe and Rachel.

## Episode Four - "[Episode 4: Dark Room](dark_room.md)" 
[File:Hideout graffiti.jpg](thumb.md) When the girls return to the junkyard at night, Max can enter the hideout instead of following Chloe. A rat will briefly run across the floor, which disgusts Max. If she decided to add her name to the graffiti earlier, both Max and Chloe's names will be circled and have the words "YOU'RE ALL GONNA DIE" written in red. The "was" in "Rachel was here" will also be replaced with a red "is".
