## **Conversation with Alternate Max** # 

*Max walks over to an alternate version of herself.*

**Max:** Who... Who are you?

**Alternate Max:** Holy shit, are you cereal? I'm you, dumbass. Or I'm one of many Maxes you've left behind...

**Max:** Can you get me out of here?

**Alternate Max:** Oh, so you want help? Thought you could control everybody and everything, huh? Twist time around your fingers?

Wasn't my choice...Wasn't my choice...
**Max:** It wasn't my choice. I didn't ask to rewind time!

{{#tag:tabber|(David killed Mr. Jefferson)# (David killed Mr. Jefferson)

**Alternate Max:** Stop playing innocent. You've left a trail of death behind you. You even let that stalker Madsen kill Jefferson... That's sick! You're way more of a cold-blooded killer than him or Nathan.

{{#tag:tabber|Self-defense.Self-defense.
**Max:** Bullshit! That was self-defense! I never set out to kill anybody.

**Alternate Max:** That doesn't make you any less of a murderer.

{{!}}-{{!}}I'm a survivor.# I'm a survivor.
**Max:** No. I'm a survivor. I don't have any experience in time travel or stopping psychopaths like Jefferson... I did what I had to.

**Alternate Max:** Oh, the jury will love to hear about your mad time travel skills.

}}

**Max:** I know what I am... You're just trying to hurt me.

**Alternate Max:** You're a goddamn hypocrite. Just look at the pain you've caused...

{{!}}-{{!}}(David didn't kill Mr. Jefferson)(David didn't kill Mr. Jefferson)

**Alternate Max:** No, but you were happy to use it to get people to like you. As if you cared about them.

{{#tag:tabber|I do care.# I do care.
**Max:** I do care! That's why I was trying to make friends...

**Alternate Max:** By telling people what they want to hear? You were just looking for a shortcut, because you can't make friends on your own.

**Max:** That's not true. I have great friends. And I've used my powers for good.

{{!}}-{{!}}That's true.That's true.
**Max:** That's true... I wasted my power on trying to be friends with everybody.

**Alternate Max:** About time you admitted that. But it's way too late after everything you've done...

**Max:** But... I still have great friends. And my power helped some.

}}

**Alternate Max:** Please, stop playing innocent. You're a goddamn hypocrite. You've left a trail of death and suffering behind you.

|-|I tried to help...# I tried to help...
**Max:** I tried to help... I only wanted to do the right thing.

**Alternate Max:** No, you only wanted to be popular. And once you got these amazing powers, your big plan was to trick people into thinking you give a rat's ass.

{{#tag:tabber|I do care.I do care.
**Max:** I do care! That's why I was trying to make friends...

**Alternate Max:** By telling people what they want to hear? You were just looking for a shortcut, because you can't make friends on your own.

**Max:** That's not true. I have great friends. And I've used my powers for good.

**Alternate Max:** Please, stop playing innocent. You're a goddamn hypocrite. You've left a trail of death and suffering behind you.

**Max:** That was not my fault, you son of a bitch...

**Alternate Max:** Don't you dare talk about our mom that way... ha!

(Chloe killed Frank)(Chloe killed Frank)
**Alternate Max:** And what about Frank? That bullet in him wasn't your fault?

|-|(Chloe didn't kill Frank)# (Chloe didn't kill Frank)
**Alternate Max:** What about the crap that was your fault?

**Alternate Max:** Wait, wait, let me guess... You fucked up time and space for your precious punk Chloe. You think she's worth all that?

We all are.We all are.
**Max:** We all are. This isn't about Chloe... or even me anymore.

**Alternate Max:** Gosh, you're so selfless now, Mahatma Max. It's too bad you pissed your power away on high school drama.

|-|My best friend.# My best friend.
**Max:** Of course. She's my best friend.

**Alternate Max:** Oh yeah, you ignored your "best friend" for five years while she went through hell... Some friend.

|-|Destiny.Destiny.
**Max:** This has to be my destiny to save her... I wouldn't be trapped in here if I didn't believe that...

{{#tag:tabber|(Stole money from the fund)# (Stole money from the fund)
**Alternate Max:** No kidding. Chloe trapped you with her drama. Guns, drugs, Rachel... Even stealing money from the handicapped fund. She's just using you, dude.

{{!}}-{{!}}(Didn't steal money from the fund)(Didn't steal money from the fund)
**Alternate Max:** No kidding. Chloe trapped you with her drama... guns, drugs, Rachel... She's just using you, dude.
