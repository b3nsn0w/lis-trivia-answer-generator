The **photography lab**, also known as the **art classroom**, is one of four main labs at [Blackwell Academy](blackwell_academy.md). [Mr. Jefferson](mr__jefferson.md) holds his lectures in this room including a course called "The Language of Photography".This information is from [Media:Max-schedule.png](max_s_timetable.md). It is well-equipped with high-tech photography equipment and literature. It's likely also used for other art courses. The photography lab is a recurring explorable location in *[Life is Strange](life_is_strange.md)* and the second featured location overall.
