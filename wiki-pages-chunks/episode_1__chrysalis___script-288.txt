## **Nightmare** 
**- [Lighthouse](lighthouse.md) -**

*It is raining heavily. The forest and the lighthouse pathway are lit up momentarily by lightning flashes. Max is lying on the ground with her eyes closed. She slowly opens her eyes and starts to look around.*

**Max:** *(thinking)'' Where am I? What's happening? *[gets up]* I'm trapped in a storm? How did I get here? ...and where is "here"?

*Max notices the lighthouse in the distance.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Wait... There's the lighthouse... I'll be safe if I can make it there... I hope... Please let me make it there...

*Max lifts up her left arm to protect herself from the wind as she walks up the path. She reaches the lighthouse and sees [The Storm](the_tornado.md) approaching [Arcadia Bay](arcadia_bay.md).*

**Max:** Holy shit.

*The tornado blows up a boat, which hits the lighthouse and breaks it in two. The upper portion starts to fall on Max.*

**Max:** Whoa! No!
