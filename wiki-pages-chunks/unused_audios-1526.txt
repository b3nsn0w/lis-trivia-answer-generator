{{Headphones|fileEp2-KateRoom-backup_witness-01.ogg}} - "Back-up witness? Well, I think we need to be careful about involving the authorities right now. Very careful..." {{Headphones|file# Ep2-KateRoom-backup_witness-02.ogg}} - "What? Why?" {{Headphones|fileEp2-KateRoom-backup_witness-03.ogg}} - "I... I think we need more evidence. As for Nathan, that rich bastard has earned some serious bad karma. He'll get it..." {{Headphones|file# Ep2-KateRoom-backup_witness-04.ogg}} - "I'd like to believe that... and I know you'll help me through this, Max. Thank you so much for believing me. I've felt so lost, alone..." {{Headphones|fileEp2-KateRoom-backup_witness-05.ogg}} (Alternate line: "And thank you so much for believing me, Max. I've felt so lost, alone..." {{Headphones|file# Ep2-KateRoom-backup_witness-07.ogg}}) - "You're not alone, Kate. None of us are. We'll figure this out together." {{Headphones|fileEp2-KateRoom-backup_witness-06.ogg}}
*Max in Kate's room after returning the book: "Now I feel weird hanging out here..." {{Headphones|file# Ep2-KateRoom-KateBook-voiceover01.ogg}} . . . "Good job, Dr. Max. I don't think she liked what I had to say. She seems more hopeless now... Maybe I should rewind and be more supportive..." {{Headphones|fileEp2-KateRoom-KateBook-voiceover02.ogg}}
*Max in [Dana's Room](dana_s_room.md) looking at her makeup: "I get so embarrassed when I try to get dolled up. Not that I need to catch a guy like that... or do I?"This line is now: "Speaking of Halloween, look at all this makeup. At least Dana knows how to use it." {{Headphones|file# Ep2-DanaRoom-Makeup-look-2.ogg}}
*Max commenting on Chloe's bad punctuality as she gets off the bus by the diner: "No way Chloe will be there early. I have the time to rewind and explore a bit. Nice." {{Headphones|fileEp2-Diner-OffBus-voiceover-01.ogg}}
*Max commenting on a dog, possibly [Pompidou](pompidou.md): "Son of aâ€”|Be careful, Max. This could be an attack dog." {{Headphones|file# Ep2-DinerPark-DogWarning-Max.ogg}}
*Comments suspected to be made by two pedestrians (female and male) outside the diner: "Another beautiful day in Arcadia Bay!" {{Headphones|fileEp2-DinerPark-PedestrianAdultFemale.ogg}} - "Oh blow me."Both of these files have "Pedestrian" in the file naming. Due to the number order, the second comment appears to be being said in response to the female's comment. {{Headphones|file# Ep2-DinerPark-PedestrianAdultMale.ogg}}
*[R.J. MacReady](fisherman.md) talking to Max outside the diner about the recent conditions in Arcadia Bay being bad for the fishing industry: "Ah, those days are done... That snow yesterday was a bad omen..." {{Headphones|fileEp2-DinerPark-Fisherman1.ogg}} . . . "It's not like the 80s. Now that was a time. You shoulda seen the rainbow trout! And that tuna would melt in your mouth..." {{Headphones|file# Ep2-DinerPark-Stand-Fisherman1.ogg}}
*Another fisherman chatting with Max outside the diner: "I was up in San Fran then. Hated the damn yuppies, but the fish was fresh and jumping right into the bucket..." {{Headphones|fileEp2-DinerPark-Fisherman2.ogg}}
*Max saying goodbye to the [Homeless Lady](homeless_lady.md): "Maybe later. I have to go now. Goodbye." {{Headphones|file# Ep2-DinerPark-HomelessLady.ogg}}
*Max commenting to herself on Chloe's lateness once she's inside the diner: "Chloe is totally late as usual. So that gives me permission to wander around before she eventually shows up at the diner." {{Headphones|fileEp2-Diner-Max-voiceover-03.ogg}}
*Comments made by a scruffy adult male inside the diner: "Just wanted a beer with my breakfast..." {{Headphones|file# Ep2-DinerPark-DegueuAdultMale-01.ogg}} . . . "No goddamn beer... in Oregon."The location and naming of these two files suggest that they would have been made by the same male that Joyce responds to with, "This is a diner, not a bar." {{Headphones|fileEp2-DinerPark-DegueuAdultMale-02.ogg}}
*Max commenting on the diner graffiti: "No comment." {{Headphones|file# Ep2-Diner-Graffiti04-look.ogg}} . . . "Assholes. Wish I had a marker to cover this up..." {{Headphones|fileEp2-Diner-Graffiti07-look.ogg}}
*Max commenting on the diner postcards: "Does anybody actually send a postcard from here?" {{Headphones|file# Ep2-Diner-CheapPostCards-look-01.ogg}} . . . "I'm glad Chloe has Joyce for a mom..." {{Headphones|fileEp2-Diner-CheapPostCards-look-02.ogg}}
*Max in the diner, commenting on a table flyer: "They would have loved my vision..." {{Headphones|file# Ep2-Diner-TableFlyer-look-01.ogg}}
