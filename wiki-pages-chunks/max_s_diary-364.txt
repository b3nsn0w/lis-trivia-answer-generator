*So Chloe and I ended up at the lighthouse, watching the sunset. Chloe was mellow and told me more about David and his uber-paranoia at school and home. It all made sense.*

*But I wanted to know why Chloe was in that bathroom with Nathan Prescott. She told me he deals drugs and she wanted to blackmail him to pay off some big loan. It's so strange where our lives have gone since the last time we hung out when we were thirteen.*

*Then I had another nightmare. Or duskmare. I was right back at the lighthouse in a storm, except this time I was following a ghostly deer until I got to the edge of the cliff. I could see the tornado destroying everything in its path, and again I could feel the cold sting of the rain. The lighthouse was crumbling and I felt so helpless watching the tornado move towards the town.*

*Then Chloe snapped me out of the dream and I told her what I saw. And as if to make the day end on another unusual note, snow started falling from the sky in the warm sunset. It felt so weird, ominous and beautiful all at once.*

*Especially standing there with my best friend. And on that positive thought, I have officially earned a great night's sleep.* ## Episode Two - "[Episode 2: Out of Time](out_of_time.md) "
