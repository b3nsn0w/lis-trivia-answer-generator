of [Maxine Caulfield](max.md) hugging [Chloe Price](chloe.md) from behind. ## Trivia 
[File:Pirate Disk.png](thumb.md)
* The cover art for the Soundtrack CD is based on the cover of a mix tape Max made for Chloe when she was 12. You can find it in a drawer in Alternative Chloe's room in "[Episode 4: Dark Room](dark_room.md)". It is referenced again in [Life is Strange: Before the Storm](_life_is_strange__before_the_storm_.md) and can be found in [Chloe's Room (Before the Storm)](chloe_s_bedroom.md).
* There is an extremely rare Vinyl version.[http://na.square-enix.com/us/blog/life-strange-vinyl-soundtrack-sweepstakes Life Is Strange Vinyl Soundtrack Sweepstakes] Only a few of these vinyls were created as promotional materials for *Life is Strange*, though (like the licensed soundtrack) they aren't sold commercially. Originally it was part of an official give away, later you could win it during [:Category:Livestreams](livestreams.md) or it was available as a prize during *Life Is Strange Fans* community's contests[http://lifeisstrangefans.com/competitions/christmas-contest/ Life Is Strange Fans Christmas Contest] and other giveaways[http://lifeisstrange-blog.tumblr.com/post/154684797850/and-the-2016-life-is-strange-community-heroes Community Heroes] (December 19, 2016). You can only get it as a Reward on the [https://store.na.square-enix.com/product/294295/life-is-strange-soundtrack-2-vinyl-record-set-reward official Square Enix shop] by using EPts you receive for buying [File:VYNIL.jpg](thumb.md)Square Enix products.
* The sticker of a cassette tape with its tape ripped out saying "RADIO KILLED ITSELF. *video is innocent!" might be a reference to the Buggles' 1978 song, "Video Killed the Radio Star".
