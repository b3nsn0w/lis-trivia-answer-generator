Here is a section of the wiki page for Easter Eggs (Life is Strange):

## Leet Train 
The train that's seen in Episode 2 and Episode 5 has "1337" written on the side. This is the way "leet" is spelled when using only numbers.

## Life is... 
It's not allowed to say the game's title! There are several occasions throughout the game where a character begins their sentence with "Life is..." arousing the expectation of finishing it with "strange", but at the end it ends differently.
* After altering the past by handing in her Everyday Heroes contest photo to Jefferson in Episode 5, Max awakes in a [San Francisco](san_francisco.md) Art Gallery. Demonstrating how surreal this situation is for her, she says,*"Life is... weird."*
* In Max's nightmare, Alternative Chloe appears and blames Max. Before she disappears, she says,*"Life is... so not fair."*
**Note: **While not featured directly in the game, the closest a character ever came to saying *"life is strange"* was during the trailer for the Limited Edition, when Max said *"then life started getting strange"*.https://www.youtube.com/watch?vY60Rp3QbT58&feature# youtu.be&t52s
