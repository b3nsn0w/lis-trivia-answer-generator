Art Director [Sébastien Gaillard](s_bastien_gaillard.md): "Really early in the game development, alongside the writing and the pre-production, we decided to have both an original soundtrack and licensed tracks, as it was logical with our intentions for this project: each of them would and should serve a precise purpose at different moments of the game. It was really important to never have music for the sake of it, as the music shouldn’t be used as a ‘song jukebox’ with no real intention. When we were writing the game and key scenes started to emerge, we started to gather hundreds of different songs that could accompany those scenes, that would not only illustrate them, but also add secondary layers of meaning and narrative."[https://www.mcvuk.com/development-news/working-in-harmony-with-licensed-soundtracks-in-games/ Working in harmony with licensed soundtracks in games] (July 11, 2016)
