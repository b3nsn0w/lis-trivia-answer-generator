Here is a section of the wiki page for Maxine Caulfield:

her doodles in Mr. Jefferson's classroom include a sketch of the movie's antagonist, Frank The Rabbit.
*It is possible that Max may possess some sort of developmental disability (such as {{Wiki|High Functioning Autism}}/{{Wiki|Asperger Syndrome}}{{Wiki|High Functioning Autism}}: "High-functioning autism is a term applied to people with autism who are deemed to be cognitively "higher functioning" (with an IQ of greater than 70) than other people with autism. Individuals with HFA or Asperger syndrome exhibit deficits in areas of communication, emotion recognition and expression, and social interaction."{{Wiki|Wikipedia}}: "Asperger Syndrome is characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, alongside restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. Although not required for diagnosis, physical clumsiness and atypical (peculiar or odd) use of language are frequently reported.", {{Wiki|Dyscalculia}}, or {{Wiki|Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD}}{{Wiki|Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}}: "In school-aged individuals inattention symptoms often result in poor school performance. Although it causes impairment, particularly in modern society, many children have a good attention span for tasks they find interesting."), as she is in an IEP (Individualized Education Program, a program usually reserved for students with said condition) according to her Student File.This could also explain her problems with social interaction, her rejective behavior towards Warren despite possible feelings for him, and also her termination of contact with Chloe after her moving to Seattle. She just might be unable to find the right way of communicating or expressing her feelings to others. It's also possible that Max suffers from some form of social/emotional disorder like {{Wiki|social anxiety}}.[https://socialanxietyinstitute.org/what-is-social-anxiety Social Anxiety Institute] and {{Wiki|Social anxiety}}: "Social anxiety is the discomfort or fear of social interaction that brings on self-unconsciousness, feelings of being negatively judged and evaluated, and, as a result, leads to avoidance and self-isolation. It's typically characterized by the fear of criticism and rejection, feelings of inadequacy, inferiority, embarrassment, humiliation, and depression." It is also possible that Max is just an introvert who is a bit shy, without any mental health conditions to speak of. When asked on Twitter about Chloe's behavior, Co-Director Michel Koch said he "never considered to affirm either BPD or depression, to not stigmatize anyone and to focus on other topics", which possibly also applies to Max.[https://twitter.com/DONTNOD_Michel/status/944177879658762240 Twitter post by Michel Koch]
*Max is a virgin judging from her shy and innocent demeanor, her comments about not having been able to "find a grove with guys" or that she always liked skater boys but they didn't like her as well as the fact that she asks Chloe what that "first magical kiss" feels like in Episode 3, which implies that she never kissed before. Nathan seems to be aware of this and mocked her because of it. In Max's nightmare in Episode 5, Mr. Jefferson calls her 'pure', unlike Rachel and Chloe, which can refer to Max being a virgin.
*Max's surname is a reference to {{Wiki|Holden Caulfield}}, the protagonist of the {{Wiki|J. D. Salinger}} novel *{{Wiki|The Catcher in the Rye}}*, a student at an exclusive boarding school like Max, and an icon for teenage rebellion and angst.This reference was confirmed in an [http://www.siliconera.com/2015/02/05/life-strange-director-talks-theme-identity-visual-novels/ interview] with Creative Director [Jean-Maxime Moris](jean_maxime_moris.md). Both have similar personality traits such as the urge to preserve innocence. A central aspect of *The Catcher in the Rye *is the dilemma of Holden's state in between adolescence and adulthood. There are several other references to that book throughout the game, such as the "the WINGER and the COW" poster in [Max's Room](max_s_room.md) which has a very similar style to the cover of *The Catcher in the Rye*, or the red cap in the principal's secretary office which resembles the hat Holden wears; she also calls it "phony" which is a characteristic word used many times by Holden in the novel.
*In "[Episode 2: Out of Time](out_of_time.md)", Joyce calls Max "{{Wiki|Nancy Drew}}", referencing to an 18-year-old girl who spends her time-solving mysteries, the protagonist of a mystery fiction series created by publisher {{Wiki|Edward Stratemeyer}}.
*There is a possible reference to the 'poker face' meme on Max's room slate.
*Max thinks that "Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within" is one of the best science-fiction movies ever made. She says it while looking at the plasma TV in [Victoria's Room](victoria_s_room.md) in Episode 1.{{Wiki|Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within}}: "This could be a reference to the fact that *Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within* was considered a box office bomb and contributed to the decline of Square Pictures."
* In the diner sequence of Max's nightmare in Episode 5, Max has to enter a code to exit the diner bathroom. If she enters the incorrect code 50 times, she will break the fourth wall and say, "I'm going to make the designers pay for all these bullshit code puzzles!"
*The font used in Max's Journal is an adjusted version of the "Dudu Calligraphy" font that can be downloaded [https://www.dafont.com/dudu-calligraphy.font here].
*An entry rule of the [Everyday Heroes Photo Contest](everyday_heroes_photo_contest.md) was to "submit an image that best represents yourself or others in heroic
