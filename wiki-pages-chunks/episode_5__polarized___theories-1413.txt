Here is a section of the wiki page for Episode 5: Polarized - Theories:

## Interpretation
* [Max's Nightmare](max_s_nightmare.md) represents her emotional reliving of all experiences in the last five days in an exaggerated form, including her fears and trauma regarding the Dark Room investigation, her feelings of guilt regarding her actions throughout the game, the [Alternative Timeline (Life is Strange)](alternative_reality.md) with [William Price](william_price.md) alive, the fate of everyone at Arcadia Bay, her self-doubts as well as the moments she spent with Chloe (as depicted in a sequence of recollected memories from the few days they spent together). ''Click [Max's Nightmare](here.md) to take a deeper look at Max's nightmare.''
* Expanding from the above theory, it has been suggested that the game in its entirety is Max's way of coping with survivor's guilt: The first storm scene is the point Max is at when 'rewinding', i.e. going back through her recollections to find out what she could have done to prevent all the frightening events of the week from happening. Some fans have stressed that because the game's final choice (as well as previous crucial decisions) revolve around Chloe Price, Max is trying to cope with either having saved her or not having saved her. The game would be her thought-experiment or a power-fantasy trying to change what can, in the end, not be changed but only lived with. This would be the final lesson of the game for Max.
* The final decision of either sacrificing Chloe or Arcadia Bay represents the Utilitarian dilemma ("The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few") and that final situation is all about making the right decision in front of moral conflicts and own desires as depicted in Max's nightmare. That would make *Life Is Strange* all about the morality and responsibility of time travel or rather life itself, and whether you can take responsibility for your decisions and bear the consequences, which is also an important part of growing up.
* One theory holds a more relatable interpretation, stating that Max got her powers through the blue butterfly and the real purpose of that power is to let Max enjoy her time with Chloe and say everything she has to say before Chloe dies. It was not really intended for her to save lives nor change the course of the future. *Life Is Strange* is about the human desire for reversing your mistakes and having a second chance, just a little bit more time; to make up for what you didn't do. It teaches us to treasure the people we love and to spend the time we have with them wisely before it could be too late, before we could be left filled with regret for the rest of our lives; like Max would've been after finding out her best friend she abandoned for five years had suddenly died, and she never reached for her in that bathroom. Furthermore, it confronts us with the question: *What are you willing to pay for the person you love? Would you really do anything, sacrifice everything for that person?* It's through these questions that the game pushes you to that extent, from taking one risk after another, investing in everything, and finally taking the immense cost of hundreds of people dying just for the one person you love the most and would do anything for, or finally learning to let them go and move on, not exactly for just the greater good, but for a sense of acceptance.
* Earlier in Polarized, Max reveals that she always wanted her life to be special, an adventure, but never without Chloe by her side. Tied in with this theory, and considering Max's getting these powers just right when she could save Chloe's life in first place shows that universe (or maybe [Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md)'s spirit, since she was guiding them throughout the whole story) gave them a chance to being together, but heavy consequences are waiting for them as *price*.
* Max (and the players) might actually have been deliberately tricked into sacrificing Chloe by the end of Episode 5. A central theme of the early episodes was bullying, and Polarized pushes Max onto a guilt trip even though there is no reason for her getting the power if she was supposed to never use it. It is normal that she is having guilt at all the destruction she witnesses, but it is strange by how many and how often she is told that everything is her fault in the last episode. Also, she has resolved nothing. The ending basically tells us that everything would have been fine (except for Chloe) if she had never started reversing time. [Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md) and Jefferson would have been arrested and Rachel found. So if she was not supposed to do anything, what was the point of it all?
* The obvious answer is that it all happened for Max to have made these "great" experiences. This interpretation is problematic, though. Max, like any person, would be much more likely to develop severe psychological issues after the experiences and choices she made. Seeing all that death and suffering, the experience of the dark room and the nightmare, letting her best friend die... It is hard to imagine her just brushing off all of that. Also, Max would be fully aware that Chloe would not have had any of these experiences and the last thing she would hear in her life is that nobody would miss her. No one would know or believe Max's sacrifices or experiences. No one would know that Chloe was a key element to saving Arcadia Bay. But if, on the other hand, the point was to learn to live with the consequences of your actions it would mean to see this through to the end and save Chloe. If she sacrificed Arcadia Bay they will again, learn to live with these consequences and not going to look back.
* There is also speculation that, in Episode 5, Chloe and Max's clothes foreshadow some major events. The deer skull T-shirt Max wears is speculated to symbolize death and the destruction of Arcadia Bay. The Ouroboros on the T-shirt Chloe wears in this episode (a serpent eating its own tail) has long represented the endless cycle of life, death, and rebirth. It symbolizes self-reflexivity or cyclicality, especially in the sense of something constantly re-creating itself (the eternal return), similar to the mythical phoenix. It used to be thought that a snake about to die would shed its skin and revert to being young and healthy, and so by shedding the surroundings of Arcadia Bay and leaving with Max, Chloe can find new life. So, maybe the tornado was the first and the last (playable) scene in the game. Perhaps the story repeats itself and the town is destroyed. Maybe the ouroboros symbolizes that Chloe sacrificing herself for the town is impossible and will cause an endless loop in the future.
