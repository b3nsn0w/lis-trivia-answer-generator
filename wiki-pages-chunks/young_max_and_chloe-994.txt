## Notes 

 (Episode 3 - Photo focus echo from the past, Max's dorm room.)Because of this, it seems unlikely that young Max would be the selfie-taking person she becomes years later.

Even from a young age, Chloe supported Max just as much as Max thought Chloe was amazing.Max: "But you're still amazing. You always have been since we were kids." (Episode 4 - Alternative Timeline, Chloe's garage bedroom.) Even as years passed, and they both lived separate lives, both girls hung on to mementos of their childhood friendship.

## Family Differences 
Max considers her family to be a lot more serious than Chloe's as her family never took any fun, goofy photos together like Chloe's did.Max: "My family never took fun, goofy photos like this..." (Episode 3 - Family portrait, Chloe's house, 2008.) Once, when they were both chastised by Chloe's father for getting out of hand, Chloe took this less seriously than Max, laughing at her father's attempts to give her and Max a "time-out." Max's believes that if she laughed like that at her own [Ryan Caulfield](father.md), he would "banish" her. This seems to suggest that Max's father was perhaps stricter with her.Max: "I remember that day by the lighthouse." . . . Chloe: "My dad was pissed at us. He actually tried to give us a time-out!" . . . Max: "And you laughed at him. My dad would have banished me." (Episode 4 - Alternative Timeline, Chloe's garage bedroom.) Max took an instant picture of Chloe and her father back in 2008, commenting on the love and the close bond it showed between them.Max: "You can see the bond between Chloe and her father... and the love. Now this is a photo." (Episode 3 - Chloe's house, 2008.) Max seemed almost envious of that father-daughter bond in her later years when she came across another photo that Chloe had held onto.Max: "Look at that... Chloe and her dad were so close." (Episode 1 - Chloe's room.) 
Regardless of Max's parents being more reserved, they did care for her, such as the time when Max accidentally swallowed the eye of her teddy bear and her parents rushed her to hospital.Max: "Ahoy, Captain. At least I know you've got my back. When I swallowed your eye and my parents rushed me to the ER, I knew we were bonded forever..." (Episode 1 - Max's dorm room.) Max also fondly reflects back on the time she had spent sewing a cushion with her [Vanessa Caulfield](mother.md), although it's not known exactly how old she was when this took place.Max: "So cheesy, but it makes me smile thinking of the day Mom and I sewed that together." (Episode 1 - Max's dorm room.)
