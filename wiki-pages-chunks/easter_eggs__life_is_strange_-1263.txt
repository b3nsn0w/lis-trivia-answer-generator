## Michel Koch 
[Michel Koch](michel_koch.md), Co-Game Director, Writer and Art Director behind *Life is Strange* himself, makes an appearance in "Polarized". Or is it a coincidence that a man exactly looking like him is sitting in the same [Plane](plane.md) as Max on her way to the Zeitgeist Gallery?

He is also featured inside the gallery. Admiring three black and white pictures, he comments on them:

*"Bad exposure, bad framing, bad picture. I could have done this so much better."*

## No Fucks Given 
In Episode 3, when Max goes back in time through a photo to find herself in her 13-year-old body on the day that William Price died, she is wearing a blue T-shirt with scrambled letters. A Reddit user managed to unscramble these letters to read, "No fucks given".The Reddit user, Kimchi816, took to [https://twitter.com/Kimchi816/status/601022764485578753/photo/1 twitter] to ask Dontnod's producer, Luc Baghadoust, if this was done on purpose. His reply was: "Haha. Maybe. :)". The concept artist, Edouard Caplain, also replied to say he was "very impressed" by the discovery.

## Reversed Reverse 
In the reversed [Blackwell Academy](blackwell_academy.md) sequence of [Max's Nightmare](max_s_nightmare.md), you can hear and see things normally if Max uses her rewind in this scene.

[Samuel Taylor](samuel.md) is the only character in this scene that doesn't speak backwards. If you walk up to him and stand next to him, you can hear his voice speaking forwards; things he already said during the game.More in [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v# K3Vx1-AJZSk this video].

## Rachel's Poster 
Rachel Amber's missing person poster appears to be based on the real-life missing poster of Sunday Blombergh.

It is interesting to note that not only the template of both posters is similar, but the content of the original missing poster seems to have inspired some of Rachel's features:
*Both Sunday and Rachel have a dragon tattoo on their calf and a (black) star tattoo on the inside of at least one of their wrists.
*Both Sunday and Rachel's height (5"5') and eye color (hazel) are the same.
*The day Sunday and Rachel went missing is the same: April 22.
*The telephone number for the Sheriff's station is the same (minus the central office code): 388-6020.

## Raoul Barbet's Signature 
Co-Game Director [Raoul Barbet](raoul_barbet.md)'s cute little dog signature is present on [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md)'s pencil case that we first see in [Episode 1: Chrysalis](episode_1.md) in [Mark Jefferson](mark_jefferson.md)'s [Photography Lab](classroom.md). It is unknown whether he drew it on the pencil case texture himself or whether somebody on the art team drew it on his behalf.

After its original appearance in the first *Life is Strange* game, Raoul's dog signature has now made its appearance on pencil cases belonging to all playable characters in the *Life is Strange* games created by Dontnod Entertainment. Just like Max's pencil case, [Chris Eriksen](chris_eriksen.md)'s in *[Captain Spirit](captain_spirit.md)* and [Sean Diaz](sean_diaz.md)'s in *[Life is Strange 2](life_is_strange_2.md)* also feature the little dog signature.

## Rewinding is Getting Old 
If you go inside the Swimming Pool lockers in "[Episode 3: Chaos Theory](chaos_theory.md)" and then rewind, Chloe says,

''"Dude, it's getting old! Try and dazzle me with another trick!"''

## Rewind Sounds 
The sounds Max hears while rewinding are reversed future and past dialog pieces or other sounds that are part of the game such as train or shoot sounds.See [https://www.youtube.com/watch?vDsfrTcCumw8 this] and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v# O3eQ_hg1waQ this] video for information and examples.
