## Question 24 

**ShadowLelouch97**

Hello Hailey! I hope you're having a great day thus far.

#What was the first video game you ever played?
#Do you have a favorite book series? If so, what is it, and what's your favorite book from that series?
#What has inspired you the most by interacting with Life is Strange and its community?
#What fictional place would you like to visit?
#What are your initial thoughts on Captain Spirit.

Once more, have a great day!

**haileyhayes**

Hello! So far so good! How are you doing? :)
#First video game I ever played was honestly probably Crash Bandicoot
#My favorite book series is Harry Potter (I know I'm basic, but what can I say? It's a great series). My favorite book is Order of the Phoenix.
#The LiS community has inspired me so much just through their never ending support. I've never had a support network quite so vast and dedicated as the LiS fans
#These questions are golden. Hmmmm if I could visit one fictional place, I think I would like to visit Camelot with all the magical creatures and adventures that come with it.
#I am so excited for Captain Spirit! I can't wait to cry.

## Question 26 

**ManuallyModerated**

Hi Hailey!

Thanks for hanging out so long with us! You are awesome as Samantha and I’m so glad your a part of this expanding LiS cast!

My question revolves around your other pursuits. Besides gaming ;) what other hobbies do you have or causes that you are passionate about?

Thanks!

P.S. - I’m literally low-key typing this under my desk so my boss doesn’t see...I look totally natural right now!

**haileyhayes**

Hello!

Thank you so much! That's very sweet of you to say and ah I'm having a blast!
Hmmm well my other hobbies include cosplay, roleplay, ghost hunting, and acting. I'm a super nerd in all aspects and very proud of it. Causes I'm passionate about are really....just "be kind to others" causes like LGBT, minority, and women's rights. You know, the stuff that shouldn't have to be said in 2018, but still need to be.

P.S. I'm rooting for you! Act natural. Blend in with your surroundings. Become the desk.

## Question 18 

**ashisnotspooky**

i'm asking questions as they pop in my head

how is it knowing all these technically famous people that you've worked with on LiS or even are just regular friends with? i mean, i know that i know you but i'm curious. do you ever get anxious about what they think of you or maybe even starstruck?

**haileyhayes**

Oh definitely, especially like my first times meeting Daye and Hannah, but they're just such kind warm inviting people that I'm comfortable around them now and I don't get nervous talking to them anymore.
