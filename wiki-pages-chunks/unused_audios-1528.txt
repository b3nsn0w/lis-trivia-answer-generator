Here is a section of the wiki page for Unused Audios:

* Max being distraught while watching herself let William die again in the nightmare: "Oh, William. I shouldn't have to choose between Chloe or her dad. I hate seeing this. Chloe... Don't hate me. William... oh, forgive me." [File:Headphones.png](16px.md)
* Younger Max talking to Max while watching her burning the photo in her nightmare (probably, unrecorded, just synthesized speech): "Burn, baby, burn." / "You sure this is a good idea, Super Max?"
*Several lines from characters present in the Two Whales Diner sequence.
*Dark Chloe comes into the diner and speaks to the real Max instead of the bad Max: "Max, you know the truth. Do not listen to this bullshit. You know what we've been gone through together this week. You know where we stand. We're a team, and this is reality." {{Headphones|fileDontNeedToRescueMe.ogg}}
* Dark Chloe trying to convince Max to let her die in the Two Whales Diner scene of her nightmare: "Max, you don't always need to rescue me. I know you just feel guilty for not staying in touch. Dude, I'm so not worth this. Look at how much I fuck everybody over. Do you think we're gonna live happily ever after if you've destroyed Arcadia Bay? Give it up, Max. We're too different after all these years. I'm so tired of fighting the world, Max." {{Headphones|file# DontNeedToRescueMe.ogg}}
* Max during the interactive Chloe and Max museum path in her nightmare: "Oh, my Chloe... It feels like we've lived a thousand lives this week. I'd do anything just to wake up next to you... Maybe if I get to the lighthouse, this will all finally end..."DONTNOD have stated that “cues are written originally and sometimes are cut to the final montage, for questions of rhythm, staging…”, and at this point in the game, they thought they had “sufficiently developed the romance between Chloe and Max even without [this cue], just with the images, the kiss that some players had according to their choices”, etc. [File:Headphones.png](16px.md)
* Chloe before Max's final choice at the [Lighthouse](lighthouse.md): "This is your destiny too, Max. And I'm not leaving you. I'll always be at your side. Like you've always been there for me. Remember... you're my partner in time." [File:Headphones.png](16px.md)
* Max when Chloe is calling her "Maxine": "Without your power, we couldn't have found her. Okay, so you're not the goddamn Time Master, but you're Maxine Caulfield, and you're amazing." - "Max... never Maxine. You know that." [File:Headphones.png](16px.md)
* A slightly different dialogue between Max and Chloe in the Sacrifice Arcadia Bay ending: "Max, now I'll always be with you." - "I know. You're my best friend." - "Forever." {{Headphones|file# AlwaysBeYourBestFriend.ogg}}
* Max instead of kissing Chloe in the Sacrifice Chloe ending: "Being together this week, it was the best farewell gift I could've hoped for. You're my hero, Max." - "Oh, Chloe... I love you." "You better. I will always love you." Also, Chloe says "don't you ever forget about me" instead of "don't you forget about me"Note 4 also applies to this audio cue. In addition, DONTNOD state that the camera zooming in on their hands as they held hands was sufficiently establishing a romance. Therefore, the inclusion of this dialogue cue became redundant with the visual cues already set up. {{Headphones|fileLiS_VO_E5_7A_ChloeEnd.ogg‎}}
* [David Madsen](david.md) after finding Chloe shot in the school's bathroom: "*crying* God... no... please... Chloe... I'm sorry I didn't make it in time... I'm sorry..." [File:Headphones.png](16px.md)
* Max after finding herself on the cliff at the lighthouse in the Sacrifice Chloe ending: "Chloe... au revoir." [File:Headphones.png](16px.md)
