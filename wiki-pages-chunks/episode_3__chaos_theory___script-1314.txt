**Max:** More than Rachel Amber?

**Chloe:** Dude, I'm not her groupie, okay? And I'm sure you have Blackwell bros all over youâ€”like Warren...

You're the bro killer.You're the bro killer.**Max:** You're the bro killer. Tats and 'tude...

**Chloe:** You did not just say that. Plus I am not down with these Arcadia Bay hillbillies.

**Max:** I don't blame you... Anyway, we have bigger fish to fry, right?

|-|Warren is nice...# Warren is nice...**Max:** Warren is nice...

**Chloe:** *[chuckles]* Nice? Ouch. That means "Friendzone."

**Max:** No, he's really cool. It was so sweet when he stood up to Nathan... But I haven't told him about my rewind power...

|-|Gross!Gross!**Max:** Ew! I don't want any Blackwell bros over me. There's a couple cute guys there but they probably think I'm a total nerd.

**Chloe:** Uh, nerds are hot. You just don't have any confidence yet.

**Max:** Unfortunately, that didn't come with my rewind power...

**Chloe:** No worries. Once you get over yourself, you're going to make the world bow.

**Max:** As long as you're there with me...

**Chloe:** Don't look so sad. I'm never leaving you...

*Max and Chloe swim away from the pool border.*

**Max:** Now I'm getting cold in here.

**Chloe:** Because we're yapping instead of attacking each other, otter-versus-shark style... I think I've had my pool experience for the year, let's jet.

**Max:** Let's call it a draw. I'm gonna freeze my ass off when I get out...

*Max and Chloe get out of the pool and put their clothes back on.*

**Max:** Gross, I feel like we just went swimming in Chlorine Bay.

**Chloe:** You look cute with your hair soaked in chemicals.

**Max:** Thanks, you would know...

*'Guards' Comments About the Search**

**Guard:''' Better not try any Halloween pranks after today... I'm serious.

**Guard:** Hello?

**Guard:** Where are they?

**Guard:** I heard something over here.

**Guard:** Who's here?

**Guard:** I got a flashlight and a stick!

**Guard:** Anybody there?!

**Guard:** Hey!

**Max:** We are so invisible!

**Chloe:** Let's bail!

**Max:** Wait, turn around, they're coming! We have to find another way out!

*Max and Chloe climb down and start walking along the wall.*

**Chloe:** This is bullshit. You can't go back to your dorm now, you're a Blackwell fugitive! Crash at my place tonight.

(David is on leave)# (David is on leave)**Max:** You want me to crash where the Blackwell security officer I just busted lives, so I'll be safe? Okay!

|-|(David isn't on leave)(David isn't on leave)**Max:** You want me to crash where the Blackwell security officer lives so I'll be safe? Okay!
