Here is a section of the wiki page for Max's Diary:

first time I saw them bond since we were kids...''

Took Chloe's SideTook Chloe's Side''Suddenly, I couldn't take it anymore either and I kind of blew up. It was like a torrent that felt AWESOME. I've been wanting to rip into David like that myself for a long time. I figured worst case scenario, hello rewind power! But I wanted Joyce to know the depth of his weird paranoia. She looked so sad and angry when I told her about the photos of Rachel and Kate, not to mention the the home surveillance. Joyce kicked his ass out of the house. To Chloe's glee.''
|-|Took David's Side# Took David's Side''But my spidey sense told me that David needed somebody to defend him. Even just this once. I just don't feel that we have enough proof to really blame him for everything. Yes, he's a harassing bully with a surveillance fetish, but he seems to be gathering information for his own investigation. The mystery story side of me appreciates that and hopes we can use his research to buffer our own...*

*Despite David's evidence and the bracelet, Chloe refused to believe Rachel was involved with Frank. This is a part of Chloe I don't much like: she gets so damn petulant if she doesn't get her way. Or if she hears something she doesn't like. Serious denial. I get why, but that doesn't make dealing with it any easier. So I threw my hands up and suggested we check out Frank's RV.*

*I knew that would piss Chloe off and she would do anything to find out what kind of relationship he had with Rachel.*

*But first we had to get the damn keys to the RV. Which meant going into the Two Whales Diner and bouncing like a rewind pinball between Frank, Nathan Prescott, and Officer Berry—and fucking with all of them. I'm still dizzy thinking about how I pulled it off. Yay for Max.*

*Sometimes I feel like I'm just cheating at life...*

*The first thing we had to do was get Frank's scary dog out of the RV. So, we did the classic cartoon "give a dog a bone" routine and CujoThis is a reference to the dog from the same-titled Stephen King's film. became Scooby DooThis is a reference to the dog from the same-titled mystery solving cartoon series. just like that.*

Threw bone into the streetThrew bone into the street*Oh my God! I don't want to think I hurt the poor thing but when I threw the meat bone out for Frank's scary dog, he ran out into the street... and I heard a screech of brakes and a loud whimper.*

*Frank's RV was pretty much what I expected—drug dealer trash chic. But it wasn't as serial killer as I feared. We ransacked the place and found what Chloe didn't want us to find...*

*I'm sorry Chloe had to see the pictures of Rachel posing for Frank, even if she did care about him. To her it's just another betrayal, just another loved one dumping on her. Everybody she ever loved she lost one way or another. Only I came back from the past... for what? To make Chloe's life more painful? I just wish I could use my rewind power to go all the way back to the days when we were covered in pancake flourThis is a foreshadowing to the events at the end of episode three. Chloe and Max made pancakes together, captured in the last photo William took before he died.... Life was simple...''

''I found Chloe's gun (or should I say David's gun?) and decided not to give it back to her. I honestly don't feel that she's any safer with it, especially considering how stupid she acts with it. But I don't want Frank coming after Chloe... I just have to make sure he doesn't.*
