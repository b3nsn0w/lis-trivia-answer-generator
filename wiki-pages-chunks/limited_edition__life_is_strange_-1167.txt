## Art Book 

#

## Cover 
[File:Limited Edition - Cover.png](thumb.md)
The cover of the art book is a replica of [Max's Journal](max_s_journal.md). It has 32 pages and is 5.25 inches (13.34 centimeters) wide by 6.75 inches (17.14 centimeters) tall. It is matte black with red white and blue printing resembling tape on the top of the front cover which does not extend to the spine, back, or the inside. The cover of the book has "stickers" on it as well as tape and postal stamps which gives it a kitschy aesthetic. The red white and blue "tape" is also visible on the right side of the first page along with a sticky note with unintelligible text and some doodles. This page has three stamps; one of a barn owl, one of a sailboat, and one of a monarch butterfly. The monarch butterfly may be an allusion to the Butterfly Effect ever-present in the game, the owl may be an allusion to the one that crosses Max and Chloe's path in [Episode 4: Dark Room](episode_four.md), and the sailboat may be an allusion to the boat that destroys the [lighthouse](lighthouse.md) in Max's visions. All the concept art of locations, photos, and paintings are taped to the pages to resemble photographs.
