**Max:** I'm sorry, Principal Wells... I'm still tense after I thought Kate was going to jump today...

**Principal Wells:** No... no explanation. Seeing Kate come up on that roof... then seeing her come down with you... You saved her ass. Pff, maybe saved Blackwell. Now don't get cocky. Go on back inside. You earned good dreams.
