The **End of the World Party** was organized by the [Vortex Club](vortex_club.md) and takes place at [Blackwell Academy](blackwell_academy.md)'s [Blackwell Swimming Pool](swimming_pool.md) on Thursday, October 10th, 2013. It is seen in the fourth episode, "[Episode 4: Dark Room](dark_room.md)".

[Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) attends the party with [Chloe Price](chloe_price.md) in order to find [Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md) as they believe he is dangerous and could be planning to hurt somebody. Depending on the player's choices, Max can warn [Victoria Chase](victoria_chase.md) that she could be in danger and not to trust Nathan. If Victoria believes Max, she will tell [Mr. Jefferson](mr__jefferson.md) and end up in the [Dark Room (Location)](dark_room.md) in the next episode, "[Episode 5: Polarized](polarized.md)".

Mr. Jefferson announces the winner of the [Everyday Heroes Photo Contest](everyday_heroes_contest.md) at the party, which turns out to be Victoria.
