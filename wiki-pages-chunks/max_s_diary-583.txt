Here is a section of the wiki page for Max's Diary:

That set David off and part of me wanted to kick him in the balls knowing he had something to do with Kate's suicide, maybe more. I thought about doing it, then flipping a quick rewind, but I knew that would be the start of a bad, dangerous habit.*

*Naturally, the Principal didn't believe me (or didn't want to), which means that David Dickhead is going to be allowed to harass other students at Blackwell until they jump off the roof*

*So Kate Marsh is dead and it's business as usual here. I hate this fucking school right now.*

Saved Kate# Saved Kate*After being grilled in the principal's den, I hung out with Warren on the lawn so I could feel grass under my feet and watch the fluffy clouds. He's such a sweetheart, he kept telling me how proud he was that I stopped Kate from jumping.

*Still, I told Warren that something ominous is happening at Blackwell Academy. Rachel Amber, Chloe and now Kate have all been victims. Not to mention me, if I keep playing amateur detective. Wish I could have let Warren know about my power, but it's not the right time... as if anything is the right time anymore.''

*And to make the day end on the most surreal note possible, the sky went dark and we watched a solar eclipse that was not announced on the news or any astronomy site.*
