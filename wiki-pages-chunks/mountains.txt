##  Interpretation 
More than the (short) lyrics, the seemingly obvious reason explaining why this song was chosen for the junkyard sequence is the video clip (released in 2011). In the clip, a woman unearths a box full of the belongings of a loved one (probably one of her ancestors). The general setup of the scene is very similar to the junkyard sequence; a woman on her knees in a remote forest, digging the ground with her bare hands looking for something.
