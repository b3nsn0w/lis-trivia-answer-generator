Here is a section of the wiki page for Young Max and Chloe:

## Activities and Interests 
***Board Games –** Max and Chloe enjoyed playing board games together, but at ages 13 and 14, they no longer played a game called "Oopsies!" which they used to play a lot and is in a scruffy condition by this time.Max: "We used to play Oopsies! a lot, but it's pretty beaten up at this point." (Farewell bonus episode - Chloe's room.) Chloe apparently beats Max every time they play it, but Max calls this "BS" and states she wiped the floor with Chloe the last time they played, so it's unclear if Chloe exaggerates her victories.Chloe: "Just cause I beat your ass every time we play doesn't make it trash." . . . Max: "You beat me?" (Farewell bonus episode - Chloe's room.)
***Painting, Decorating, and Drawing –** Max and Chloe drew themselves in a comic strip as Super Max and Dr. Chloenstein and called one of their strips *The Adventurous Adventures of Super Max and Dr. Chloenstein.*These characters seem to be the same ones that can be seen on the "Power Girls" poster they drew together (as seen in the original game). It is unknown if this different naming in the Farewell bonus episode by Deck Nine Games is an inconsistency or whether "Power Girls" is now to be seen as an all-encompassing name for the duo. They also liked to decorate things together with excessive use of stickers, such as the tall blue dresser in the attic.It is also seen in the original game that they placed stickers all over a flip phone when they were younger.
***Watching Films –** They both liked watching {{wiki|The Land Before Time}}.
***Concerts –** They went to their first unsupervised concert together on Saturday July 7th, 2007. It was to see "Mimi and the Screamers" at [Culm Nation Park Pavillion](culm_nation_park_pavillion.md) in Arcadia Bay, Oregon, and they were on the lower level. Tickets cost $30.00 each. Max would have been 11 years old at the time. Chloe would have recently turned 13.
***Halloween Costumes –** There are photos of them dressed up for Halloween in 2001 and 2002. In 2001, they appear to be dressed as a cream-filled chocolate chip cookie where the cream effect is created once they stand together. In 2001, they went as characters from *{{wiki|The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe}}*. Max was the lion, Chloe was the Witch, and William was the wardrobe. These costumes may have been for the "kiddie costume parade" held at the Halloween Bazaar (as advertized on a flyer inside the [Two Whales Diner](two_whales_diner.md) in the original game).
***Challenges –** They bought a jawbreaker as a gag to take it in turns to lick it to nonexistence over time. Chloe describes it as the "never-ending candy." Max sees it as a serious biohazard as this is yet another thing that Chloe has held on to. She's even kept it, unwrapped, on top of some clothes in a drawer!
***Playing Pirates –** Their much-loved pirate phaseWe see nostalgia for this period in their life in both the original game and Before the Storm. was in full swing when Max was 7 years old and Chloe was 9.There are [Canon_Inconsistencies#Incorrect_Ages](discrepancies.md) in Farewell with the ages they state they were on the date written on the audio cassette tape that Chloe finds in her room. Some of the things they did during this phase are as follows:
** They kept all of their old pirate drawings inside a big sketchbook.
** They called their pirate ship "The bane of Arcadia."
** Chloe's former cat, Bongo, was given a pirate name of "Pogo."
** Their enemy was called "evil commander Shelley, enemy to all pirates," who threatened to take their treasure map from them if it was seen. Shelley is actually Ms. Shelley, their Social Studies teacher from 2003.
** They invented new names for locations around [Price Household (2008)](chloe_s_house.md), such as "Secret Lair" (Chloe's bedroom), "Scary Cave" (Chloe's attic), Treasure island, and Price Castle.
** Their pirate ship was the swing set outside, but during bad weather, they used the couch in the living room as their "rainy day pirate ship."
** They gave each other Pirate names: "Captain Bluebeard" and "Long Max Silver." (They stuck blue painter's tape to Chloe's face to make a blue beard.)
** They buried treasure (a time capsule) in Chloe's back yard, then drew a map and created an amulet to find it.
** Unknown to them, Chloe's dad invented the name "Bloody Bill" for himself and recorded a secret tape for them to eventually find in their time capsule.

***Magic -** Chloe went through a magic phase and still owns her box of magic tricks ("Miss Madalyn's Managerie of Magic"Chloe's box of magic tricks may be named after [https://www.linkedin.com/in/madeleinetate Madeleine Tate] who was the Associate Producer for [Life is Strange: Before the Storm](life_is_strange__before_the_storm.md) at [Deck Nine Games](deck_nine_games.md).) which she had to save weeks of allowance money to buy. This is actually her entire magic collection.Chloe: "Are you insane? That's my entire magic collection. Do you know how many weeks of allowance this cost?"(Farewell bonus episode - Chloe's room.) Chloe did think magic was lame but changed her mind when she found out how much children's birthday parties pay. However, she hasn't used this box of tricks since her fifth grade talent show (age 10/11) where Max, who was her assistant, turned out to be squeamish at the sight of fake blood. The fact that Max thinks she was lucky to survive Chloe's magic phase with all her fingers intact suggests that Chloe was perhaps a little daring with her tricks.
