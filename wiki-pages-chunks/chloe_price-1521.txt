Here is a section of the wiki page for Chloe Price:

31 of her journal: "It shocks me that the girl I grew up with watching SpongeBob ended up in such a scary orbit.", *{{Wiki|Power Rangers}}*One of the things Max can say when talking to Alternative Chloe is: "To me, it seems like yesterday we were little brats here, watching Power Rangers and destroying the kitchen.", ''{{Wiki|Blue's Clues}}''One of Max's idle comments while in Chloe's room in Episode 1: "I guess she's not into Blue's Clues or Teletubbies anymore...", and *{{Wiki|Teletubbies}}*.
*Until she was 14, Chloe used to read teenage lifestyle magazines such as "Tween Life Magazine".
*An [Media:VO E5 5C.STM 336~Cue E5 5C Diner FrankJoycePompidouAlive IGE Joyce 030.ogg](unused_audio_file.md) spoken by Joyce to Frank implies that Chloe always wanted to have a dog.
*Chloe makes comments to Max that seem quite flirtatious on occasion, and her exact relationship to Rachel is left ambiguous. Chloe's voice actress sees her as sexually fluid.In an [https://femhype.wordpress.com/2015/10/27/hella-talk-an-interview-with-ashly-burch-on-chloe-price-queerness-life-is-strange/ interview] with voice actress Ashy Burch, she states that she thinks, "Chloe is sexually fluid. I don’t think she really likes to label herself in any particular way." Perhaps supportive of this view is the porn magazine featuring girls in her hideout at the junkyard, her disclosure of a "boy toy phase" and the condoms Max can find in Chloe's shirt pocket. Chloe tells Max that boys are gross, which could imply that she's more into girls than boys. She tells Max that Rachel "saved her" during her "boy toy phase," which indicates that Rachel may have been the first girl Chloe fell in love (or lust) with and was perhaps the turning point in Chloe realizing she's attracted to girls a whole lot more. In Episode 4, Chloe makes a flirtatious comment about Jefferson in the presence of Max, however, this was potentially said to get a rise out of Max. In Episode 5, during Max's nightmare (shaped by her own insecurities), Chloe flirts with other students, male and female, in front of Max, who can end up emotionally hurt by this. Chloe does act somewhat possessive of Max, at first trying to guilt-trip Max into ditching her school friend, Kate, to hang out with her instead, and later referring to herself as "Max's date" to the Vortex Club's party. If Max kisses Chloe on a dare in Episode 3, Chloe tells Max that now she can text Warren to tell him he doesn't stand a chance. (Warren's texts to Max later on do imply that Chloe did exactly this.)
*The photo of Max Chloe puts up as her mobile phone background in Episode 3 if Max supported her enough until then is the same picture Max uses in her social media profile page. It's presumed that Chloe followed Max to her social media page and downloaded the picture from there, although it is also possible Max may have invited Chloe to Max's social media page in addition to exchanging their mobile phone numbers after seeing her again in the first episode.
*Chloe's character might be based on {{Wiki|Lisbeth Salander}} from *{{Wiki|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo}}*. The female protagonist has a very similar attitude and punk rock style like Chloe; she has the same badass attitude, short colored hair, tattoos and piercings, wears boots and skull motifs. A poster in Chloe's room looks identical to the one used in a promo for the American movie. Chloe's skull shirt from Episode 1 closely resembles the skull motif on Lisbeth's shirt in the Swedish version. Though it's not directly linked to Chloe, Rachel's dragon tattoo is very similar to the dragon image on the Swedish version's film cover.
*Chloe might also be based on Emma from the French movie *{{Wiki|Blue Is the Warmest Color (comics)|Blue is the Warmest Color}}*. Both characters are punkish, rebellious teenage girls with short blue hair and are LGBT. In Emma's case, she is gay, whereas it is kept ambiguous whether Chloe is specifically bisexual, pansexual, gay, or sexually fluid.
*In Episode 5 during Max's nightmare, you need a digicode to get to the next area. The digicode is 0311, likely representing Chloe's birthday, 03/11 (March 11th).
*The phrase "Everybody Lies, No Exceptions" that is written on Chloe's wall is a line from the old animated MTV series *Daria*, which is focused on Daria Morgendorffer, a smart, acerbic, and somewhat misanthropic teenage girl who observes the world around her. Chloe is even drawn in a cool little Daria style next to it. Daria might have been an inspiration for Chloe's character.
*"One day your life will flash before your eyes", another phrase written on Chloe's wall is actually a quote by Gerard Way.
*There is a blue {{Wiki|Awareness ribbon}} on the photo album in Alternative Chloe’s room. Among its meanings is ARDS ({{Wiki|Acute respiratory distress syndrome|Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome}}), a medical condition that may be caused by trauma.

* It was apparently possible for Chloe to die at the end of the confrontation with Frank on the beach in Episode 4 while trying to protect Max, as [Media:Chloedead.ogg](several_unused_audio_files.md) named "Chloedead" seem to indicate. This probably would lead to a forced
