Here is a section of the wiki page for Max's Diary:

VictoriaDidn't Warn Victoria''No matter how evil I thought Victoria was, she's actually just a terribly insecure person with talent, passion, and a tendency to be a cruel dick for no good reason. But that doesn't mean she'll step outside herself to look at me without her hate. I tried to see beyond our petty mean girl drama, assuming she has some role to play in all of this, but she made it impossible and I had to find Chloe. I felt shitty not warning her, but I just have to hope that Victoria is the one person Nathan would leave alone, if only out of friendship or the fact that assholes stick together.* ## Episode Five - "[Episode 5: Polarized](polarized.md)"
