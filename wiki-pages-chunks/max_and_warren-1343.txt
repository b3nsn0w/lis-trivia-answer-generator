Here is a section of the wiki page for Max and Warren:

## Episode Two - "[Episode 2: Out of Time](out_of_time.md)" 
[File:Warren_window.jpg](thumb.md)
Warren can be first seen peeking at [Max's Room](max_s_dorm.md) from around the corner of the dormitory grounds only if Max walks immediately over to a window within seconds of waking. 

If Max saves Alyssa from a toilet paper they will talk a little. Alyssa will say "You and Warren do know your sci-fi. Be careful, you might make Brooke jealous..." and Max will reply to it as "I'll just pretend I have no idea what you mean."

Soon afterwards, they encounter each other around the corner of the building, where he still waits for her. He wants to ask Max about defending her from Nathan the day before and asks who the girl is who showed up in her truck "like a rock star". Max doesn't disclose too much about the situation with Nathan, neither does she discuss her powers with him. Warren suggests to Max that they should go to the [Drive-In](drive_in_theater.md) for the 70's "Planet of the Apes" marathon. Max can say 'yes' or 'no' to his suggestion before leaving to get the bus to meet Chloe at the [Two Whales Diner](two_whales_diner.md).

Accept Warren's invitation# Accept Warren's invitationIf Max agrees to go to the drive-in with Warren he will say that it was easier than he thought, and will also reveal his intention to text Brooke about it. Max will write a further journal entry to say she has agreed. However, she will also write: ''"Hope he doesn't make a lame move on me... (Not that he would, egomaniac.) Warren and I do have a lot in common, but he's like a supercool geek brother."''
|-|Decline Warren's invitationDecline Warren's invitationIf Max declines Warren's suggestion to go to the drive-in together Warren will get disappointed and will say: "I have to see if Brooke wants to go to the drive-in." Max will write that he tried to get her to go and she refused. She also writes that she's *"not really in the mood this week"* and that she also ''doesn't want to lead him on.''

Max writes in her journal afterwards that she "felt like a dick" because she hadn't contacted Warren to see if he was okay after his run-in with Nathan on the parking lot. At this time, Max feels that the less Warren knows, the better for him. She admits that she would love to tell him about her ability to rewind time and space, but doesn't think the moment is right. She also jokes in her journal that he would want to marry her immediately if he found out, just so he could have his own human time machine, or capture her for scientific experiments... Or make her go to the drive-in with him.

Later, he texts Max if she wants to check out his science experiment. If Max does, he asks her what what ingredient he needs for his experiment. Using her powers, Max can rewind and ask [Michelle Grant](miss_grant.md) what ingredient is needed with the information she has from Warren. If his experiment succeeds, Max remarks to herself that it was fun helping him and he is "pretty cute when he is in full-on geek mode". If Max gives him a random answer, Warren will fail at his science experiment, and the mixture will blow up. Max remarks that she "shouldn't laugh but he looks so ridiculous."

Shortly before Max's class starts, Warren enters her [Photography Lab](art_class.md) to tell her that [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md)'s eyes were puffy from crying. He tells Max that he didn't know what to say to her and she didn't tell him anything. [Mark Jefferson](mr__jefferson.md) then enters the classroom and tells everyone who is not in his class to leave, which includes Warren.

[Zachary Riggins](zachary_riggins.md) shouts into the classroom that "some crazy shit is going down at the girls' dorm" and everybody rushes out of the class, including Max. She sees Warren comforting [Alyssa Anderson](alyssa_anderson.md) as they both watch Kate standing up on the roof.

If Max didn't answer Kate's call earlier, during Kate's suicide attempt, one of Max's excuses for not answering the phone will be, "I thought it was Warren! He's been blowing up my phone ever since I gave him my number..." and thinking that she was going to get a brand new phone.

After Kate's (attempted) suicide, he comforts Max at the campus, and she tells him about her experience with Kate and that she is still worried about Kate (if she survived). Max tells him that she thinks something ominous is going on at Blackwell and that she is working on proof that Kate Marsh is somehow connected to [Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md) along with Nathan and Mr. Madsen. He says "he is not a big conspiracy guy but wouldn't doubt it". Warren asks Max what she thinks is really happening, but their conversation is interrupted by the sight of an unexpected solar eclipse. [File:LifeIsStrange 2015-05-25 09-15-49-42.png](thumb.md) Max comments that "the weather confirms this weird day" and she feels the "chill." He points out to her that there was no eclipse scheduled today since he would have known about it. Max hugs her body from the cold, which causes Warren to move closer to her and lay an arm around her, drawing her close. To his comment about the eclipse, she replies: "I believe you, Warren... I'll believe anything this week..."
