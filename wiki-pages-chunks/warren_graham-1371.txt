## Personality 
Warren is a stereotypical science nerd who "knows how to be invisible" and loves old and obscure movies and anime. He has a kind and sensitive nature and is highly interested in Max. He always tries to get closer to her but, depending on Max's reactions to his offers and advances, he may end up having to deal with rejection constantly. He's also very shy and insecure with girls and struggles to express and deal with his feelings, so he tries to hide that underneath humor and bad jokes. He is a good friend, as he's always friendly and protective over Max. Although normally he's the one who would get beaten up, he finds the courage to defend Max against [Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md).

## Biography 
The following is what Max wrote about Warren in her [Max's Journal](journal.md):

*"I knew if I gave Warren my phone he would blow it up for "science". He wants his flash drive back after letting me borrow it for less than a week. He told me to watch everything because he has tons of cool TV shows and films on there.*

''Thank Gawd it wasn't porn. He loves science but he really understands art and appreciates great photography. Even though he says he loves my pictures, I can't tell if he's just being nice.*

*Warren is a geek but he definitely lets you know where he stands, I don't think he would ever lie to me. It feels good to have at least one strong ally the same age here... And he makes me smile."''

## Appearance 
Warren has an average build, choppy brown hair and matching hue eyes. He always dresses casually, wears jeans, sometimes a sweatshirt and t-shirts connected with geek culture throughout the game. After being hit by Nathan, he has a bruise around his left eye.

## Background 
Warren was born and probably grew up in [Arcadia Bay](arcadia_bay.md).

At 16 years old, he is probably the youngest student at Blackwell Academy. He stands out with excellent scientific knowledge as shown by his GPA of 4.0; therefore, he is considered an exemplary and gifted student by [Raymond Wells](principal_wells.md). It can be assumed that he has advanced a few grades due to his academic abilities.
