Here is a section of the wiki page for Theories and Speculations (Life is Strange):

## Blue Butterfly 
*The [Blue Butterfly](blue_butterfly.md) at the end of Episode 5 is speculated to be [Chloe Price](chloe_price.md)'s spirit animal, due to the fact that the blue butterfly appears at the start of Episode 1 when Chloe is shot by [Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md), in a drawing in the alternative reality and as referred below in an ending, this makes even more sense if taken in account that the blue butterfly symbolizes rebirth and change in a lot of cultures. The only entry in [Max's Nightmare](max_s_nightmare.md) journal features a drawing of a [Media:Maxnightmarejournal.png](butterfly_with_chloe_s_head.md), further foreshadowing the final choice. The texture file of that drawing is named Spirit_animal_Chloe, which reinforces the theory of the butterfly being Chloe's spirit animal. In the Sacrifice Chloe ending, a blue butterfly is landing on Chloe's coffin. Not to mention, whilst speculating *Chaos Theory,* a butterfly could cause a [storm](storm.md).

## Blue Jay 
*There is also a strong symbolism associated with Chloe's spirit animal being the [Blue Jay](blue_jay.md). The Native American roots of the Blue Jay spirit animal is vast and involves an ancient character named Blue-Jay who is ultimately good-natured and wants to help humanity, but cannot help but specialize in being mischievous. This is highly associated with Chloe's personality.
Blue Jay also travels to the land of the dead frequently, which makes sense as Chloe frequently dies and is heavily associated with death colors and motifs. Blue Jay is finally at peace with his death, appreciating the world of the dead only after he is finally gone. This could be symbolic of the end to Chloe's emotional suffering after her death, and possibly the end of her physical suffering in the [Alternative Timeline (Life is Strange)](alternative_timeline.md). (This could also be a hint to the theory that Chloe is actually meant to die, disregarding Max's constantly saving her.)
The Blue Jay in the game frequently dies, and Max is given the task of saving it. In Joyce's bedroom in Chrysalis, downstairs in the [Madsen Household](madsen_household.md) in Chaos Theory, and again in Dark Room, we find a Blue Jay and are given the option to save it or not. This is hugely symbolic of Max's constant choice of whether to save or abandon Chloe.

## Doe 
*There are many theories surrounding the true meaning of the [doe](doe.md) in the game. One is that the doe is the spirit of [Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md). This could be likely considering that it appears over her burial site, and again when the body of Rachel is discovered.
*Another likely theory is that the doe is simply Max's spirit animal sent to guide her through her time-travel ordeal. It leads her to the burial site days before the discovery of the body, and bows its head in peaceful reverence for the dead when Max and Chloe find the body. Due to the doe T-shirt designs that Max wears (as well as doe necklace during one of the game endings), [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) has a connection to this animal and so the doe could be Max's spirit animal. Another fact that lends more support to this theory is that the doe seems immune to Max's rewind power, just like the blue butterfly Max sees in the girls' bathroom at the start of the game. After Max becomes aware of her power not even the blue butterfly is immune, only Max and the doe seem to share this immunity. The doe also guides Max in two occasions, during the lighthouse climb in the final of Episode 1 and during a short part of her nightmare in Episode 5. [Samuel Taylor](samuel_taylor.md) says that the doe is Max's spirit animal and that it could be a sign of her destiny when she tells him that a doe was looking right at her like it was trying to communicate. Max's personality traits fit far better with the doe spirit animal than that of Rachel, making it likely that it is her true spirit animal, or totem.

*It could also be that these two theories are linked and that the spirit of Rachel presents itself as a doe as Max's spirit guide.
