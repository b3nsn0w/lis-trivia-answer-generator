**Optional Conversation with Justin**

**Max:** What's up, Justin?

I am.# I am.**Max:** I am always taking photos. I am a camera.

**Justin:** You crack me up, Maxter. Of course, I'm baked, so I'll laugh at anything.

**Max:** You should be studying, bad boy.

|-|Not yet.Not yet.**Max:** Not yet. I need to... get my coffee on too.

**Justin:** Throw in a little green bud and you have the perfect hippie cocktail.

**Max:** You are so not a hippie.

**Justin:** So where's all your homework, schoolgirl?

**Max:** School. Speaking of buds, I saw your bro Trevor sneaking out of Dana's room.

**Justin:** Trevor finally told me about him and Dana hooking up. He got there first, so I snooze and I lose... See ya later, Max.

**Optional Conversation with Trevor**

**Max:** Hey, Trevor.

**Trevor:** Holla, Max. By the way, I know you saw me in the dorm.

**Trevor:** Yeah, and I finally had to tell Justin, because, well, he was into her too.

|-|No.No.**Max:** No, I actually didn't.

**Trevor:** Thought you were staring right at my face. I guess you know now... and so does Justin.

**Max:** How did Justin react?

**Trevor:** I got him blazed. He was cool. Nobody has secrets in Blackwell anyway... See you in class, Max.

**Joyce:** And there she is--a lovely young woman. How are you doing, Max?

*Joyce pours coffee into the mug in front of Max.*

**Max:** Hi, Joyce, it's nice to see you again. You look the same.

**Joyce:** Like I'm still a waitress at Two Whales after all these years?

**Max:** No, like you still look pretty.

**Joyce:** Nice save, kid. You're still smart.

**Joyce:** I am sorry that was your introduction to David. I hope you get to know him on your terms, not Chloe's. He's a good man... He just--

**Max:** Yeah, I'm sure he is, since you married him, but...don't be so harsh on Chloe.

**Joyce:** It's good you're here.

|-|Took the blame for Chloe/Came out of hidingTook the blame for Chloe/Came out of hiding**Joyce:** But not that smart... Now you get busted for smoking pot. I heard the whole sordid story from David. I'm sorry this was how you had to meet him. He's a good man...no matter what Chloe says.

**Max:** Yeah, I'm sure. I don't even smoke...like, ever. It was almost an accident. Very stupid. I'm sorry.

**Joyce:** It surprised me fierce.

**Joyce:** I was hoping you could be a good influence in her life now...

**Max:** I will be. Promise. I know things were hard for you and Chloe. I feel bad I didn't call. Now my folks are in Seattle and I'm all alone at Blackwell. It's my karma.
