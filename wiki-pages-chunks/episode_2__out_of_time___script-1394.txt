Here is a section of the wiki page for Episode 2: Out of Time - Script:

It's over. Just another Blackwell mini-drama...

**Zachary:** You mean stupid shit. Man, I just don't get Victoria. What does she want?

**Max:** Probably for all of us to talk about her. Like now...

**Zachary:** Then let's not. You're pretty smart, Max. See you at the game Friday.

|-|I won't.# I won't.**Max:** I won't. That's what Victoria wanted.

**Zachary:** Yeah. I notice she kinda set up her own drama. Even if it fucks her over. Weird.

**Max:** She doesn't have to, though.

**Zachary:** That's what I don't get at all. She's hot, rich, and talented... What more does she need? Anyway, see you at the game Friday, Max.

*If Max tries to talk to Zachary again*

**Zachary:** Hey bro, later.

Stayed hidden/Blamed ChloeStayed hidden/Blamed Chloe**David:** Do you mind if we talk about what happened yesterday with Chloe?

{{#tag:tabber|You hit Chloe.# You hit Chloe.**Max:** You hit Chloe.

{{!}}-{{!}}I don't think so.I don't think so.**Max:** I don't think so. And you hit Chloe.

{{#tag:tabber|(Stayed hidden)# (Stayed hidden)**David:** I'm sure she told you why. Did she mention...she probably stole one of my guns?
{{!}}-{{!}}(Didn't hide)(Didn't hide)**David:** She got in my face and called me a "pig." And I was still wrong. I'll make it up to Chloe. And I'm sorry.

{{#tag:tabber|Yes.Yes.**Max:** Yes, it was. You know that marijuana is almost legal in Oregon. I can get it at Blackwell.

{{!}}-{{!}}No.# No.**Max:** No, it belonged to a friend of mine.

}}

**Max:** Are you going to bust me now, Mr. Madsen?

**David:** Even I'm not that much of an asshole... And I am sorry about yesterday. I was wrong, but upset. Cannabis is not a big deal to you, but it has been to Chloe.

**Max:** You're a combat veteran. She's no threat to you.

**David:** If I didn't care about her, I wouldn't care at all. When I was her age, I was out raising a lot more hell. She's better than that. All you kids are. So is Kate Marsh.

{{#tag:tabber|You treat Kate bad.# You treat Kate bad.**Max:** But you treat Kate pretty bad...

{{!}}-{{!}}What about Kate?What about Kate?**Max:** What about Kate?

**David:** I shouldn't have said anything... You know about that video going around.

**Max:** Is that why you hassled Kate yesterday? I took a photo of that moment for surveillance sake.

**David:** Soldier, you don't have the facts. You think I'm a hypocrite because I want cameras around here for the safety of the students?

**David:** You stepped between us at a pretty bad time. She's another matter entirely.

**Max:** Kate hasn't done anything wrong.

**David:** Max, this isn't just about Kate Marsh. My concern is for the safety of all Blackwell students. Including you.

**Max:** That'll take more than surveillance cameras.

**David:** It will take more than Ms. Grant and her petition to find missing students.

**Max:** Isn't that your responsibility as head of security? Unless you know something about Rachel Amber that nobody else does...

**David:** I don't want to fight with you anymore. I don't want to fight with anyone anymore... That's all, Max.

*If Max tries to talk to David again*

**David:** You best not bother chatting me up now.

*After entering the hallway leading to the science lab and art class, Max gets a text from Warren. After seeing itâ€¦*

**Max (thinking):** *I still have time...I could go see Warren playing mad scientist in the lab.*

'''Logan and Juliet's Conversation**

**Juliet:** I saw Victoria and her friends shopping for the party.

**Logan:** That reminds me, I have to score some weed from Nathan...

**Optional Conversation with Evan**

**Evan:** Yo, Maxwell Smart. Talk later, cool?
