**Trucker:** Peachy. Interview over.

Bad day?# Bad day?**Max:** Having a bad day at the office?

{{#tag:tabber|(Max damaged the railroad tracks)(Max damaged the railroad tracks)**Trucker:** Some punks messed with the train tracks and now I have to wait for three days until I get my cargo. Time is money for a guy like me.

**Max:** Uh... oh yeah, that sucks...

{{!}}-{{!}}(Max didn't damage the railroad tracks)# (Max didn't damage the railroad tracks)**Trucker:** Work has dried up around here and I have bills to pay. Time is money for a guy like me.

**Max:** That sucks.

{{#tag:tabber|(Saved Kate)(Saved Kate)**Trucker:** Wish I could drive right out of Arcadia Bay. The whole town is crumbling—snow, eclipse, and a slut trying to commit suicide...

**Max:** Maybe you should leave then.

**Trucker:** Would if I could. Hell, even that shifty Rachel what's-her-face once asked me if I'd drive her to Los Angeles...

{{!}}-{{!}}(Didn't save Kate)# (Didn't save Kate)**Trucker:** Wish I could drive right out of goddamn Arcadia Bay. The whole town is crumbling—snow, eclipse, that slut suicide...

{{#tag:tabber|Kate's not a slut.Kate's not a slut.**Max:** Listen, Kate Marsh was not a slut. She was severely depressed for good reasons. You didn't even know her, did you?

**Trucker:** I know all these Blackwell spoiled shits. Like that other loser I'd see around here... Rachel.

**Max:** You knew Rachel Amber? Can you tell me about her?

**Trucker:** Nope. Christ, why don't you get a real job instead of homework? I'd love to see you Blackwell turds try to drive my 1977 Needham eighteen-wheeler out there! Like I said, interview over.

|-|Worst interview.Worst interview.**Max:** Worst. Interview. Ever.

**Trucker:** How the hell did you know that?

{{#tag:tabber|Blackwell class.Blackwell class.**Max:** I took a Blackwell class on the history of... truckers. I always wanted to drive a rig on the road.

**Trucker:** Finally, a Blackwell student with brains. Next time I get a local job, I'll let you ride along. Take care.

{{!}}-{{!}}Rachel Amber.# Rachel Amber.**Max:** My friend Rachel Amber told me about this cool rig in town because I love taking pictures of truckers.

**Trucker:** You knew Rachel? She sure didn't give a rat's ass about truckers... or real work.

**Max:** Oh, so you must have known her too?

**Trucker:** Only from the diner. She was just a gold digger—she belonged in California with all those... you know whats... good riddance. But you can take pictures of my truck anytime. Take care.

*Max bends down to take a photo.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* So ominous...
