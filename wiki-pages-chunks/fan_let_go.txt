##  Lyrics 
:Feathers of blue
:Reminds me of you
:And how I used to
:Be with you

:What's the price of amber eyes?
:When all you did was leave
:I can't let go
:No o oh - it hella hurts

:What's the price of amber eyes?
:When all I do is grieve
:I can't let go
:No o oh - it hella hurts

:found in the dust
:American rust

:Angel of mine
:You ran out of time
:Victim of crime
:Drenched in grime

:What's the price of amber eyes?
:When all you did was leave
:I can't let go
:No o oh - it hella hurts

:What's the price of amber eyes?
:When all I do is grieve
:I can't let go
:No o oh - it hella hurts

:You are my angel in the dusk
:I miss you Rachel, ohhh

:What's the price of amber eyes?
:When all I do is grieve
:I can't let go
:No o oh - it hella hurts

:I'll never, ever
:Let it go
:I'll never, ever
:Let you go
:I'll never, ever
:Let it go
:Wont let go

:I'll never, ever
:Let it go
:I'll never, ever
:Let you go
:I'll never, ever
:Let it go
:Never go!
