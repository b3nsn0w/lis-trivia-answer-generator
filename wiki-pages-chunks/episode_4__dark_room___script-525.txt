Stayed out of it# Stayed out of it**Chloe:** For beating the shit out of Nathan Prescott! Dude, you rule.

**Warren:** I don't know. I kinda went crazy there...like Nathan.

|-|Stopped WarrenStopped Warren**Chloe:** For headbutting Nathan Prescott! That was awesome!

**Warren:** I don't know. I almost went crazy there...like Nathan.

**Max: **You're not anything like him.

**Warren: **Good to know. So, where are you going? I better stick with you guys. Just in case you need me to get my Hulk on again. Or should I call the cops on Nathan?

**Max: **No police. Not yet. Uh...so maybe you better...um...

**Chloe: **Warren, me and Max have to do this on our own. No offense.

**Warren: **It's cool. Whatever I can do to help...

**Max: **What you can do is find out anything you can about Nathan's father.

**Warren: **I'm on it. Between the snow and eclipse, I'm assuming the apocalypse is around the corner...

**Max: **And...thank you. Seriously. I'll call you later.

**Warren: **You better. I'm feeling pretty alpha now.

**Max: **Yes. You are.

*Warren leaves.*

**Chloe: **Man, that guy is so fucking in love with you.

**Max: **I know...

**Chloe: **He really did give a serious beatdown to Nathan.

**Max: **It was a little scary to watch him do that...

**Chloe: **Now let's make a date with Frank.

**Max: **Will he even answer you?

**Chloe: **Frank always answers when he wants money.

*Chloe takes out her phone and texts Frank. Her phone dings as Frank replies immediately.*

**Chloe: **Like I said, Frank wants to see me right now.

**Max: **Let's not keep him waiting...

*Max and Chloe leave the Main Campus.*
