#  Everyday Heroes Photo Contest 

[File:Everyday_Heroes_Poster.png](thumb.md)

The **Everyday Heroes Photo Contest** is a national competition for people to submit one image on approved paper that best represented themselves or others in a heroic action. The winner will fly to {{Wiki|San Francisco}} and represent their school at the [Zeitgeist Gallery](zeitgeist_gallery.md) on October 11. Contestants aged 18 and under will need to have a parent permission form included with their submission. [Mark Jefferson](mark_jefferson.md) told his photography class about the contest on September 23, as mentioned in [Max's Diary](max_s_diary.md)"Speaking of pictures, Mr. Jefferson told us about the national 'Everyday Heroes' photo contest he wants us all to enter. The winner gets a trip to San Francisco and lots of publicity. He wants just one photograph from each student. This is exactly why I wanted to come to Blackwell and of course I'm scared shitless to enter. At least I have a couple weeks before the deadline in October. So I have plenty of time to stress and procrastinate. Sigh." (Max on September 23, 2013), and wanted everyone to enter. It's first mentioned in Jefferson's class right at the beginning of the game when [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) is troubled about entering her own photo. Jefferson seems to be especially keen on Max entering a photo for the contest, possibly to have an easier way to drug her and take her to his [Dark Room (Location)](dark_room.md).

## Mentions 
The everyday hero theme is a recurring and central motif throughout the game:
* Max feels like an "Everyday Hero" if she defends [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md) when she is being harassed by [David Madsen](david_madsen.md) at the beginning of "[Episode 1: Chrysalis](chrysalis.md)".
* If Max tells Kate not to call the police, she guilt-trips herself in her diary saying, "Hello, 'Everyday Hero'!"
* After helping Kate down the rooftop, Max writes in her diary that she doesn't feel that "everyday heroic".
* After breaking into [Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md)'s [Nathan's Room](dorm_room.md), Max expresses concern at having internalized spying and stealing so casually over the week, and calls herself ironically an "Everyday Hero."
* After being captured by Jefferson, Max writes in her diary in "[Episode 5: Polarized](polarized.md)" that she thought she was a real "everyday superhero", but at the end she is just Max Caulfield.
* After informing David of Jefferson's deeds and helping him in busting Jefferson, Nathan and the Dark Room, Max writes in her diary that David had become a real everyday hero.
* (TBC)
