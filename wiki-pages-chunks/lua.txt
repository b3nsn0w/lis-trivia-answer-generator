##  Lyrics 
:I know that it is freezing but I think we have to walk
:I keep waving at the taxis; they keep turning their lights off
:But Julie knows a party at some actor's west side loft
:Supplies are endless in the evening; by the morning they'll be gone.

:When everything is lonely I can be my own best friend
:I get a coffee and the paper; have my own conversations
:With the sidewalk and the pigeons and my window reflection
:The mask I polish in the evening, by the morning looks like shit.

:And I know you have a heavy heart; I can feel it when we kiss
:So many men stronger than me have thrown their backs out trying to lift it
:But me I'm not a gamble you can count on me to split
:The love I sell you in the evening, by the morning won't exist.

:You're looking skinny like a model with your eyes all painted black
:You just keep going to the bathroom always say you'll be right back
:Well it takes one to know one, kid, I think you've got it bad
:But what's so easy in the evening, by the morning is such a drag.

:I've got a flask inside my pocket we can share it on the train
:If you promise to stay conscious I will try and do the same
:We might die from medication, but we sure killed all the pain
:But what was normal in the evening, by the morning seems insane.

:And I'm not sure what the trouble was that started all of this
:The reasons all have run away but the feeling never did
:It's not something I would recommend, but it is one way to live
:Cause what is simple in the moonlight, by the morning never is
:What's so simple in the moonlight, now is so complicated 
:What's so simple in the moonlight, so simple in the moonlight

##  Trivia 
* The song's line "We might die from medication but we sure killed all the pain" could be foreshadowing [Chloe Price](chloe.md)'s fate in the [Alternative Timeline](alternative_timeline.md) if [Maxine Caulfield](max.md) would choose to accept Chloe's request (by granting Chloe an overdose of morphine).
