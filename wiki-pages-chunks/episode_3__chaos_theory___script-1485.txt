Here is a section of the wiki page for Episode 3: Chaos Theory - Script:

be... Do you think she's...?

Alive?# Alive?**Max:** Alive? I HAVE to think that, Chloe. Her spirit is SO powerful here...

**Chloe:** Maybe too much power...

|-|Dead?Dead?**Max:** Dead? I'm sorry. I hate even saying that, Chloe.

**Chloe:** Not as much as I hate thinking it.

|-|Kicking it.# Kicking it.**Max:** Kicking it in Los Angeles? That would be the best-case scenario...

**Chloe:** She wouldn't leave without me, okay? And how often do missing girls turn up?

**Chloe:** Max, we have to find Rachel soon. We have to...

**Max:** I promise you we will. Like you said, it's time to start the search for clues. Now tell me, what's your secret?

**Chloe:** Drum roll, please... *[holds up a pair of keys]* I present the spare keys to Blackwell. Thank you, step-prick.

**Max:** You are such a boss, Chloe! *(hesitantly)* I just...don't want you to get into any more trouble...

(Max is suspended)(Max is suspended)**Chloe:** Look at all the trouble dropping in Arcadia Bay. At this point, who gives a fuck anymore? You're suspended anyway, Max. Lead the way.

|-|(Max is not suspended)# (Max is not suspended)**Chloe:** Look at all the trouble dropping in Arcadia Bay. At this point, who gives a fuck anymore? We're in it to win it, Max. Lead the way...

*Max and Chloe begin walking toward the school building.*

**Max:** I'm so glad you're my partner in crime...

**Chloe:** As long as you're my partner in time.

**Max:** Insert groan here...

**Victoria:** *(in background)* Thank you again SO much for helping me put together a portfolio.

''Max and Chloe hear Victoria and hide behind one of the boards on the main campus displaying Jefferson's photos.''

**Jefferson:** Hopefully, the rest of the class will follow your lead. I'm sorry I was...distracted. As you know, it's not been a good day for Blackwell.

**Victoria:** I know this has been an awful day and you can talk to me anytime, Mr. Jefferson.

**Jefferson:** Thank you, Victoria.

(Saved Kate)(Saved Kate)**Jefferson:** I'm glad it had a relatively happy ending.

**Victoria:** I don't know what I would've done if Katie jumped...

|-|(Didn't save Kate)# (Didn't save Kate)**Jefferson:** I imagine...you're pretty upset over Kate as well...

**Victoria:** I'm, like, still in shock. I've never seen anybody die. I really cared about Katie.

**Jefferson:** "Katie"? I...had no idea you two were that close. Did she...?

**Victoria:** Well...how does this affect the Everyday Heroes contest?

(Jefferson is suspended from contest)(Jefferson is suspended from contest)**Jefferson:** The contest will go on, I just won't be representing Blackwell at the event this year thanks to Max, who claims I enabled Kate Marsh's trouble by merely listening to her.

|-|(Jefferson isn't suspended from contest)# (Jefferson isn't suspended from contest)**Jefferson:** It doesn't. The contest is still a-go and I still have to pick the winner to best represent Blackwell. I've got all the photos except one from...Max.

**Victoria:** I'll give you a one-word sneak preview of Max's photo: selfie. Listen...you've seen my entry, you know it's better than that. Wouldn't that be SO cool to hang out together in San Francisco, Mark?

(Jefferson is suspended from contest)(Jefferson is suspended from contest)**Jefferson:** Stick to Mr. Jefferson, Victoria. I won't be going to San Francisco, remember?

|-|(Jefferson isn't suspended from contest)# (Jefferson isn't suspended from contest)**Jefferson:** Stick to Mr. Jefferson, Victoria, please? And, uh...I haven't picked a winner yet.

*Jefferson starts to leave, but Victoria grabs his arm and stops him.*

**Victoria:** You already love my work, so it's not like you're playing favorites. Just imagine if you picked my photo, though...we would have to spend a LOT of time together... That could be...fun, don't you think?

**Jefferson:** I'm going to think that you didn't say any of that.

**Victoria:** You might as well choose me...otherwise I might have to tell people you offered to choose my photo for favors or something...

**Jefferson:** As a favor to your future, I'll also ignore that undisguised threat. This conversation is officially over, Miss Chase. I suggest you go back to your dorm now.

**Victoria:** Wait!

*Jefferson starts to leave; Victoria reaches for his arm, but he continues walking away.*

**Victoria:** I only...

*Victoria holds her head in disappointment.*

**Victoria:** *[sighs]* *(to herself)* Are you fucking kidding me?

''Victoria walks past Max and Chloe on her way back to her dorm but doesn't notice them.*

**Victoria:** *(to herself)'' So stupid...

**Max:** Just when I think Victoria can't get ANY more evil...

**Chloe:** Shit is about to get real at Blackwell...

**Max:** Let's go find out.

''Max grabs Chloe's hand and they leave their hiding spot. Chloe opens the door to the Blackwell hallway and they both enter.*
