Here is a section of the wiki page for References (Life is Strange):

## The Butterfly Effect 
* The protagonists of *The Butterfly Effect* trilogy all have the ability to visit and alter their past through devices like photographs (or diaries, films) and so create different timelines/realities like Max who can use photographs.
* The protagonist of *{{Wiki|The Butterfly Effect}}*, the first movie of the trilogy, Evan, suffers from headaches, unconsciousness and nosebleeds caused by overusing his ability like Max (though the reason here differs from simply overusing; Evan's brain has to deal with additional memories from all the alternative timelines he creates, whereas Max's brain seems just to be over-challenged by rewinding too much or the attempt of rewinding too far).
* Just like Max, Evan moved away from his hometown when he was 13 leaving his childhood friend behind. They fell out of touch and when he meets her again years later, he has to realize how messed up her life has become since he disappeared from her life. When she, shortly after seeing each other for the first time after all these years, dies, Evan uses his power to prevent her death and tries to change her past for the better.
* Evan changes a major event in his and his childhood friend's past and so creates a new timeline inadvertently resulting in someone ending up permanently in a wheelchair, exactly like in the [Alternative Timeline (Life is Strange)](alternative_timeline.md) Max creates at the end of Episode 3 (though, here it is the protagonist himself that ends up in a wheelchair).
* Evan creates another timeline where his alter ego appears to be the opposite of his personality, member of a popular and elitist social group and friends with people he never would've befriended, which is another aspect of the alternate timeline created by Max in which she is a member of the popular Vortex Club and friends with Nathan and Victoria.
* Halfway through Episode 5, Max wakes up in a timeline where she's back in the Dark Room and cannot escape using her powers because Jefferson burned her diary and photos. Similarly, in the climax of the film, Evan wakes up in a timeline where he's in a mental institution and cannot escape because in this timeline his diaries (his medium for time travel) don't exist.
* At the end of the story Evan has to let go of the person he desperately tried to save throughout the whole story to create a morally acceptable timeline, which resembles the Sacrifice Chloe ending.
* Every time Evan and Max change something in the past, there is a [Timestream](photo_montage.md) of old and new memories that replace each other in the new timeline.
* The Dark Room mirrors the basement of the protagonist's childhood friend's father who wanted to take illicit videos of his daughter and Evan when they were younger. The cuts and transitions that occur when Evan regains consciousness after his blackouts or when going back to this scene resemble the ones that occur in *Life is Strange* when Max is waking up/regaining consciousness in the Dark Room scenes with Jefferson wanting to take pictures of her.

## Donnie Darko 
* Both *Life is Strange* and *{{Wiki|Donnie Darko}}* shares the approach of {{Wiki|Parallel Universes|Tangent Universes}} and the general idea of time travel.
* A common central theme of *{{Wiki|Donnie Darko}}* is the idea of sacrificing one person to save a small American town. In the film, it's the protagonist Donnie that is sacrificed.
* Middlesex and Arcadia Bay are both destroyed by a time vortex resembling a tornado.
* Both in *Life is Strange* and *Donnie Darko* features a well-respected male figure with a secret history of abuse and predation for which he gets busted.
* The first scene of the film shows Donnie waking up from a previous iteration of the time-loop he is stuck into: he gets up off the ground, alone, confused, in a remote area over looking his town, having no clue how he ended up there. This is strikingly similar to what happens to Max in the very first scene of the game.
* In Episode 1, there is a drawing of [w:c:villains:Frank (Donnie Darko)](frank_the_rabbit.md) from *Donnie Darko* on Max's notebook. Frank Bowers' first name is also believed to be a reference to this character.
* In Episode 2, a car license plate in the [Blackwell Parking Lot](blackwell_parking_lot.md) of the Two Whales reads DNNDRK (Donnie Darko).
* In Episode 2, it is shown that Max has a copy of *Donnie Darko* in her room.
* In Episode 2 and *Donnie Darko*, there are scenes involving shooting at glass bottles for target practice.

## Blue is the Warmest Colour 
*Both *Life is Strange* and *{{wiki|Blue Is the Warmest Color (comics)|Blue is the Warmest Colour}}* are coming of age stories about an introverted girl falling for a wild blue-haired girl who appears to be her polar opposite in interests and personality.*[File:Clementine-emma-bleu-est-une-couleur.jpg](thumb.md)*
*Both revolve around LGBT themes.
*Clementine and Emma from the graphic novel version of *Blue is the Warmest Colour* look nearly identical to Max and Chloe from *Life is Strange*.
*It's very likely that Max keeping a diary is inspired by the diary Clementine keeps that the graphic novel revolves around.

## The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo 
* Both *Life is Strange* and *The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo* revolve around the search for a woman who has been missing for long period of time.
* Both villains keep documentation of their victims in photos.
* Chloe's skull shirt from Episode 1 closely resembles the skull motif on Lisbeth's shirt in the Swedish version of the movie.
* A poster in Chloe's and Dana's rooms looks identical to the one used in a promo for the American movie version.
* Both villains own a sleek, high-tech dungeon for imprisoning and photographing their victims, who are all young women.
* Both Nathan Prescott and Martin Vanger acquired their psychopathic tendencies from their fathers. In the game, Nathan Prescott develops his psychotic urges as a reaction to his father's overbearing expectations. It could also be argued that Mr. Jefferson becomes a surrogate father for Nathan and tries to teach him to funnel his anger into his sadistic artwork, but is inevitably unable to control him.
