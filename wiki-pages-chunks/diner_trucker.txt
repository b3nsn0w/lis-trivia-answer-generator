The **"Diner Trucker"** is a resident of [Arcadia Bay](arcadia_bay.md). He is sitting at the counter in the [Two Whales Diner](two_whales_diner.md).

##  Episode Two - "[Episode 2: Out of Time](out_of_time.md)" 
When [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) tries to speak to him, he will say that he doesn't feel like talking and has to "deliver a load of breakfast" to his stomach.

If Max hesitates after [Chloe Price](chloe_price.md) asks her to go to the [American Rust Junkyard](junkyard.md), he can be heard talking with the [Truck Driver](truck_driver.md) about how much the latter eats.

##  Episode Five - "[Episode 5: Polarized](polarized.md)" 
He appears in the diner sequence of [Max's Nightmare](max_s_nightmare.md), sitting at the counter at the same place as in "Out of Time", but with his head turned to the left and a frowning face. He asks Max if she can call his mother in [Portland](portland.md) and tell her that he loves her.

In the Sacrifice Arcadia Bay ending, it is possible that he may have died in the storm.
