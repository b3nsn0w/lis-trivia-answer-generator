## Storm Timeline 
Max travels back in time using the photo [Warren Graham](warren_graham.md) took of them together. Max convinces Chloe not to search for [Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md) and instead to tell David about Jefferson and the Dark Room. A timestream montage shows Max and Chloe warning David, Jefferson being arrested by David and several other policemen, and Max and Chloe facing the storm together.

## Sacrifice Chloe Timeline 
At the end of the game, Max is faced with her biggest decision so far - save Chloe and let the tornado destroy Arcadia Bay, or sacrifice Chloe in order to save everyone. If the player chooses the latter, Max focuses on the photo of the [Blue Butterfly](blue_butterfly.md) and travels to the beginning of the game; this time, she doesn't intervene and allows Nathan to shoot Chloe in the stomach. A timestream montage shows David handcuffing Nathan, Nathan interrogated by the police, Jefferson being arrested by the police, Max talking to [Joyce Price](joyce_price.md) and David, Max hugging her teddy bear, Joyce giving Max a box with Chloe's belongings, Max looking at polaroids and Max standing near the [lighthouse](lighthouse.md) on the cliff. If Max doesn't pick this choice, then these changes will not happen.
