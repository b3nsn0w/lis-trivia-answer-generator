Here is a section of the wiki page for Max and Chloe:

## TPing the Neighbor's House 
After their Blackwell night trip, Max mentions in her diary (page 47) how it reminded her of the time they were going to TP one of the neighbor's houses. They snuck out but ended up being too afraid to go through with it and ran back home.

"''Even though my body smelled like I had been doused in chlorine, it was so nice to crash in Chloe's room for the first time in five years and wake up next to her like our old sleepovers... For some reason, it reminded me of the time we were going to TP one of the neighbor's houses and we even snuck out but got chicken and ran back home, laughing all the way..."*

## Views on their Relationship 
* In the [Developer_Diary_Series_(Life is Strange)](developer_diary_series.md) in January 2015, [Michel Koch](michel_koch.md) and [Raoul Barbet](raoul_barbet.md) stated their very first interpretation of the relationship was "Max and Chloe are different, but they are also opposite and complementary at the same time. I think one is not good without the other."[https://youtu.be/Z-lDFJH_IHc?t# 8m49s Life Is Strange Developer Diary - A New Beginning]; [https://i.imgur.com/yZ5jj7S.jpg Screenshots]
* In October 2015, Co-game Director Michel Koch said in a [https://twitter.com/DONTNOD_Michel/status/658789176955924480 Twitter reply] to another user that Max and Chloe can still continue as just best friends after the ending, because, to him, *"it really depends on the way you played Max and her relationship with Chloe through the game."'' The localized files for the final pages of Max's journal are given the prefixes 'FRIEND' or 'LOVE', so this correlates with what the Co-game Director has said. It seems from certain comments in Max's journal, regardless of how you play the game, that Max has developing feelings for Chloe, shows general disinterest in Warren at this particular time and even writes that she regrets not kissing Chloe if she hadn't kissed her earlier when she was dared; but as Michel Koch has said, this does not mean a romantic relationship is guaranteed to happen if that's not how the player sees things unfolding between them after the "Sacrifice Arcadia Bay" ending. Regarding why they aren't seen to kiss in this ending if the same criteria has been met that achieves the "Pricefield kiss" in the "Sacrifice Chloe" ending, Michel Koch says earlier in the same [https://twitter.com/DONTNOD_Michel/status/657051836147351552 Twitter thread] that, ''"It wasn't the moment, with all the destruction and death... It will certainly happen after, it's an open end."''
* In February 2016, Michel Koch confirmed that Max and Chloe is the ultimate pairing during a [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/39608332 Twitch stream] with [Luc Baghadoust](luc_baghadoust.md). When interviewers asked about romance (i.e. Max and Chloe's relationship), he replied: "''Chloe et Max ne marchent qu'ensemble''", which means they "only walked together" (as also in romantically attached to each other) as in they are a great pair and can only function with each other. He also called Chloe an antagonist and her being the opposite of Max and how it's the reason their pairing worked.
* In February 2018, when [Hannah Telle](hannah_telle.md)'s (Max Caulfield's VA) was asked about their relationship and their love for each other, she said: "Their relationship is bigger than that. Bigger than love. Bigger than romantic." [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v_Xhb_fvZ4UM Video link]

## Before the Storm 
*Before the Storm* is set three years prior to the events of the main game and two years after Max moved to Seattle. Max is not making an appearance in *Before the Storm*, as it is set during the period where Max is absent from Chloe's life; however, Chloe is feeling her absence and will reference her throughout the game. Chloe also is writing [Chloe's Letters](letters_to_max.md) which she never sends because she gave up hope that she would ever play an important role in Max's life again.
