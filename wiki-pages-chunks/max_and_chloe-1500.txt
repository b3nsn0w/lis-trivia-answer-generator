Here is a section of the wiki page for Max and Chloe:

## Trivia 
**Life is Strange* - In [Episode 1: Chrysalis](episode_1.md), when Max is in [Chloe's Room](chloe_s_bedroom.md), she can open a drawer in the blue dressing cabinet and see an old drawing they did together (believed to have been made on the same day as another image dated 07.28.2007 that we see with it on the lounge table in an earlier timeline). In Episode 3, there is now an old [Media:LifeIsStrange 2016-07-28 14-25-37-504.png](cell_phone.md) lying on top of this drawing. Max comments that she remembers this phone because they had decorated it together ("Chloe + Max" is scratched into the paint). The appearance of this phone implies that Chloe has been going through all of her things that remind her of the old days with Max, as though she has been reminiscing about their friendship when Max isn't around. This is further supported in Episode 3 by Max finding a photo of the two of them on her 10th birthday inside Chloe's shoe box of photos. This photo was either not visible or present in Episode 1, as Max only commented on photos she saw of Chloe and her real father. It appears that the photo of Max and Chloe together may have been placed on the top.
**Life is Strange*'s [Don't Nod](developers.md) had the following dynamics for Max and Chloe's relationship in mind: "We wanted them to be quite different. We wanted Chloe to be the best friend [to Max], but we also wanted her to be one of the main antagonists. We tried to find a balance in the hostile best friend."[https://www.polygon.com/2014/8/14/6003109/remember-me-creators-next-game-looks-like-gone-home-with-time-travel Remember Me creator's next game looks like Gone Home with time travel] (August 14, 2014)
* *Life is Strange* - There are options to change the lock screen on Chloe's phone from a picture of Chloe and Rachel to one of just Max. However, the lock screen will remain unchanged no matter what if Max does not hide from David and blames Chloe directly for the weed he finds in Chloe's room in Episode 1.
* *Life is Strange* - Throughout the game, the color blue seems to be associated with Chloe, and pinks and pinkish reds seem associated with Max. It may not be a coincidence that Max has a blue screensaver on her computer and Chloe has a pinkish red one. Even in the alternative timeline, Chloe has the same color screensaver.
* September 21, 2008 to March 10, 2009 is the only date range where Chloe would be 14 and Max would be 13. Max left Arcadia Bay when Chloe was 14, and we know that Max was 13 when William Price died in a tragic car accident in 2008. (The date range for William's death could only be September 21 to December 31 based on the months in 2008 where Max is 13.)
* Chloe would have started as a freshman at Blackwell Academy in fall 2008 at age 14. Max would have still been in Arcadia Bay when Chloe started going to school at Blackwell, as Max only turned 13 in September 2008.
*The fan community refers to a romantic pairing between Max and Chloe as "Pricefield," and those who support a romance are referred to as "Pricefielders."
**Life is Strange 2* - In July, 2017 (the month the [Sean Diaz](main_protagonist.md) leaves the desert commune where Chloe's step-father now lives), Chloe would be 23 years of age and Max would be 21 years of age (turning 22 two months later).
