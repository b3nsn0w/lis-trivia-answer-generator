Here is a section of the wiki page for Warren Graham:

## Episode Four - "[Episode 4: Dark Room](dark_room.md)" 
Warren takes a more prominent role in this episode. After Max collects evidence from Nathan's room in the male section of the Prescott Dormitory, Nathan confronts her and Chloe at the exit. Max and Chloe are pushed around by Nathan, and Warren appears to intervene. He headbutts Nathan to the floor after the fight breaks out between them, which terrifies Max. When Nathan tries to counter by pulling a gun from his pocket, Warren kicks the gun out of his hand and starts beating up Nathan. Warren can carry on beating up Nathan, depending on whether Max stops him or not.

If Max intervenes# If Max intervenesIf Max intervenes, she breaks up the fight and Warren leaves Nathan alone. He gets up, collects his gun and warns that his father is on his way to the dormitory, and that they won't get away with treating him poorly. He runs back into his dorm room slightly injured. This results in his jacket being present later in the Dark Room. 
|-|If Max doesn't interveneIf Max doesn't interveneWarren violently beats Nathan up, kicking him in the stomach. Chloe collects the fallen gun and the girls leave the dorm with Warren as Nathan writhes on the ground in pain. Afterwards he can be heard saying things like "Everybody hates me... Everybody". He is clearly too injured to get up. This results in his jacket not being in the Dark Room later in the episode.

After his fight with Nathan, they will talk about it outside the dormitory. Max will thank Warren for his intervention, and Chloe will tell him that he's awesome for beating Nathan up. But he doesn't know how to think about his actions, as he thinks it might make him as bad as Nathan. Max reassures him that he isn't anything like Nathan, and Warren will suggest accompanying Chloe and Max on their investigations or to call the police, but his offers get rejected by Chloe who tells him that it's something that she and Max must do alone. Instead, Max asks him to find out more about Nathan's father [Sean Prescott](sean_prescott.md) and promises to call him later. Before he heads back to his room, he states how "alpha" he feels now and Max agrees with him. When he leaves, Chloe comments to Max on how he's totally in love with her, which Max responds with "I know".

Warren will later text Max regarding the incident and state his wish to see her at the party, so they can celebrate. If Max left behind a message on his room slate earlier, he will also thank Max for that and state that he will never erase it.

Chloe believes Nathan is responsible for the death of [Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md) and heads to the "[End of the World Party](end_of_the_world_party.md)" with Max. The two encounter Warren outside who claims he's glad that they decided to attend the party with him, but Warren gets rejected on this score. He takes a photo of himself with Max on her instant camera and keeps this photo. Noticing that Warren still seems a little wrecked regarding what happened in the boys' dormitory earlier, Max asks him how he feels. When asked about Nathan, he tells them that he hasn't seen Nathan as he was holed up in his room. Warren also explains that he's at the party because he wants to feel like a normal student after this week's ultraviolence. He never hit anybody before, and usually, *he* was the one who would get beat up. Warren is drunk despite only having half a beer; it is possible his drink was spiked to prevent him from aiding Chloe and Max from that point onward.

[File:319630 screenshots 2015-07-30 00099.jpg](right.md) |At Warren's insistence, Max takes a picture with Warren "for prosperity." Before the two girls enter the party, she asks him to text her immediately if he sees Nathan and to be aware of him. Warren jokes he knows how to be invisible, and Max replies that he's not to her.

## Episode Five - "[Episode 5: Polarized](polarized.md)" 
Warren is seen in the [Two Whales Diner](two_whales_diner.md) after he, [Joyce Price](joyce_price.md), and [Frank Bowers](frank_bowers.md) (if he did not die in Episode 4) have barricaded themselves inside it. Warren has gathered all the medical supplies he can find. Max finally talks to Warren about her powers and asks him for the picture he took outside the End of the World party so that she can go back in time and save Chloe. Depending on the level of interest Max has shown in Warren throughout the week, she will have the option to kiss Warren as well as the option to hug or just leave him behind without showing him any affection.

Hug# Hug If Max chooses to hug Warren, they share a long hug and Warren embraces her very closely. Warren will tell her to better leave before he isn't able to let her go anymore, and Max calls him one of her heroes. 

|-|LeaveLeave If Max chooses not to show Warren any affection, she only tells him to watch out for Joyce (and Frank), which leaves Warren very disappointed.

|-|Kiss# KissIf Max chooses to kiss Warren "for luck", they share a short kiss. Warren will tell her that he always wanted to say something to her, but Max cuts him off and tells him she knows.

He also appears in the maze area of [Max's Nightmare](max_s_nightmare.md), searching for Max, as well as in the nightmare versions of the [Dark Room (Location)](dark_room.md) and the Two Whales Diner.

If Max later chooses to sacrifice Arcadia Bay, the whole town is reduced to rubble. Three SMS messages reveal Max tried to send warning messages about the tornado to Warren with no response from him, which hints he might have been killed in the [storm](storm.md) or is hiding somewhere underground where there is no mobile phone reception. As Chloe and Max drive past the destroyed diner, a body can be seen covered in a blanket next to a blue overturned SUV which resembles Warren's car (although it is unclear if the dead body is Warren or not). *[Life Is Strange 2](life_is_strange_2.md) *confirms that [Joyce Price](joyce_price.md) died in the storm and, since she was presumably still in the Two Whales when she died, this could mean that Warren also died. [Life is Strange (Comic Series)](the_comic_nbsp_.md)similarly has Joyce die in the storm, along with Warren.

If Max chooses to sacrifice Chloe to save Arcadia Bay, Warren is shown to be alive and is one of the attendees at Chloe's funeral, with Max standing next to him.
