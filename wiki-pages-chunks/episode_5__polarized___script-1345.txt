Here is a section of the wiki page for Episode 5: Polarized - Script:

beatdown? Oh, oh, oh, Max, you’re way more disturbed and dangerous than me...

**Nathan:'* Snitches get stitches! *(determinant)''

**Nathan:** Hey, bitch. You can get me expelled, but you can't escape. *(determinant)*

**Nathan:** Holy shit, you really think Victoria is going to be your best friend forever? She will always hate you! *(determinant)*

'''David's comments (Maze 3)**

**David:** You can’t escape my surveillance, missy!

**David:** You thought I was harassing Kate, but I was helping her! What the hell did you do for her?

**David:** You’re such a hypocrite, Max. I may be a dick, but at least I’m honest. You just use your power to cheat at life... and cheat your friends out of life.

**David:** Hey, Max. Pretty fucking ironic that I ended up being right about everything and you end up destroying the town.

**David:** Come on, Max, just admit that you’re jealous of my service record. Admit it!

**David:** Hey, Max, please come here. So I can beat you up!

**David:''' Admit it, Max... you're a stoner! A pothead! A weed junkie! *(determinant)*

**David:** My beautiful wife Joyce hates me because of you, Max... Are you proud? *(determinant)*

'''Frank's comments (Maze 4)**

**Frank:** Get your bony ass over here! I am gonna cut you open, freak!

**Frank:** Those were my beans, Max... Those were my fucking beans!!!

**Frank:** How can I get to Heaven when you keep putting me through Hell?

**Frank:** If you took some of my drugs, maybe you’d be a lot happier.

**Frank:** Now that Rachel’s dead... it’s time for you to die too, skank...

**Frank:** Max, you need to get high like Rachel... Want some drugs?

**Frank:''' Oh man, you shoulda heard Chloe smack-talk you. It was brutal. But, of course, I see what she's talking about, now...

**Frank:** Pssst, Max! Me and Rachel are floating down here in the sewer... Come on down!

**Frank:** I sure hope you don’t think we’re buddies now... *(determinant)*

**Frank:** You are at the top of my shit list, now, Max. *(determinant)*

'''Mr. Jefferson's comments (Maze 4)**

**Mr. Jefferson:** Max... Max... I want to share my gift with you...

**Mr. Jefferson:** Now that Chloe is dead, you won’t be distracted in class anymore...

**Mr. Jefferson:** If only you could have seen Rachel... my blood spattered angel...

**Mr. Jefferson:** You will be my greatest portrait, Max...

**Mr. Jefferson:** Max... Max... I want to share my gift with you... Don’t you dare run away...

**Mr. Jefferson:** Rachel, Rachel Amber... Just like her last name, I can finally see right through her skin... and feel that cold, rotting flesh...

**Mr. Jefferson:** Max, Rachel not only gave great headshots... she gave great head. Especially after I dug her body up to be with her one final time. Why are you looking at me like that?

**Mr. Jefferson:''' Max, come back in the Dark Room. I know you're dying for it.

**Mr. Jefferson:** Since Kate isn’t around anymore, I need a volunteer for the Dark Room... Max? *(determinant)*

'''Nathan's comments (Maze 4)**

**Nathan:** Just because I’m mentally ill doesn’t mean I deserve to die, Max!

**Nathan:** Nobody ever helped me, Max. Especially you...

**Nathan:''' Hey, Max. Whatthefuckever are you going to do now that I'm dead?

**Nathan:** Holy fucking shit, Max... That was hilarious when you guys dug up Rachel’s body! Ha, ha, ha! "Oh, oh no, no, no. Boo hoo. Oh, Rachel is worm food..." Comedy Gold. Genius!

**Nathan:** It’s going to be so sweet when I bury your carcass next to Rachel and do an epic photo shoot...

**Nathan:** Hey, Max, do you want to say hello to Rachel? She's posing for me in Hell!

**Nathan:** Oh, man, Rachel looked just like a zombie model in the dirt... Just bone, meat and maggots. I would be all over that shit. You wanna take pictures?

'''Max's comments about collecting bottles (Maze 4)**

**First bottle:** Oh no... Bottles. This might be Hell.

**Second bottle:''' Well, these ones aren't too hard to find.

**Third bottle:** When did I get bad bottle karma?

**Fourth bottle:** Is there one more left?

**Fifth bottle:** Please let that be the last one...
