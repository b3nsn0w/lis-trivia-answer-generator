Here is a section of the wiki page for Max's Camera:

## Background 
Ever since Max was a young child, she has been drawn to old analog camera gear rather than digital tech, and her interest in photography has lasted into her late teens.

Five years before the events of *Life is Strange*, the [:Category:Caulfield Family](caulfields.md) left [Arcadia Bay](arcadia_bay.md) to move to [Seattle](seattle.md). It can be assumed Max spent those years honing her photography skills before being accepted into [Blackwell Academy](blackwell_academy.md)'s scholarship program during the summer of 2013. She is happy to have been accepted into such a prestigious art school and is looking forward to [Mark Jefferson](mark_jefferson.md)'s class which she describes as being "one of the best photography programs in the country." 

Max appreciates all kinds of styles and techniques when it comes to photography, but it is the instant camera selfie that she loves most.

## Life is Strange 
We first see Max's camera in Jefferson's [Photography Lab](classroom.md) near the beginning of Episode 1, "[Episode 1: Chrysalis](chrysalis.md)." During this lesson, the shock of predicting an occurrence ([Victoria Chase](victoria_chase.md)'s phone ringing) makes her accidentally knock it off her desk, breaking it. She manages to fix it by testing her [rewind](rewind.md) power that has suddenly manifested. The camera is broken once again during a confrontation with [Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md) on Blackwell Academy's [Blackwell Parking Lot](parking_lot.md). After failing to fix it at [Chloe Price](chloe_price.md)'s [Madsen Household](house.md), Chloe gives her a replacement instant camera as a belated birthday gift. This camera originally belonged to her father, [William Price](william_price.md).

If Max chooses to save Arcadia Bay, Max will revert to her original yellow camera which will never have been broken in the first place. Max will also receive William's old camera from Joyce as seen in the last [Timestream](timestream_montage.md). It is unknown if this is the camera she will use from this moment on.

## Alternative Timeline 
In the [Alternative Timeline (Life is Strange)](alternative_timeline.md), William uses his camera to take a picture of Chloe and Max, the same picture she uses to go back to this moment. Max also has the chance to use his camera to take a picture of Chloe and William cooking.

## Before the Storm 
In the prequel game, *[Life is Strange: Before the Storm](before_the_storm.md)*, the instant camera that originally belonged to William and was later gifted to Max can be seen in the garage of the [Price Household (Before the Storm)](price_household.md). When Chloe looks at it, she wonders if there are still films made for it.

In the bonus episode, "[Farewell](farewell.md)", Max can pick up and take a selfie with the instant camera that belongs to Chloe's father, and she can use it to take photos throughout the episode. When Max asks Chloe why her dad's camera is in her room, Chloe tells Max that her dad said she could bring it up there for Max to use because he's tired of watching her drool all over herself every time he uses it - "his words."
