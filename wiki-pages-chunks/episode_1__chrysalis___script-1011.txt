bathroom.

**Max:** I'm sorry, but I really have to use the bathroom.

**Mr. Jefferson:** Nice try, Max. But you're not gonna get away that easy. We can talk more after class.

**Max:** *(shaking her head, thinking)* Oh, shit, Jefferson wants to keep me after class. And I need time to save that girl...

**Mr. Jefferson:** Is there anybody here who knows their stuff?

**Victoria:** Louis Daguerre was a French painter who created "daguerreotypes" a process that gave portraits a sharp reflective style, like a mirror. Now you're totally stuck in the Retro Zone. Sad face.

**Mr. Jefferson:** Very good, Victoria. The Daguerreian Process brought out fine detail in people's faces, making them extremely popular from the 1800's onward.

**Max:** *(thinking)* What if I rewind again, and give him the right answer?

*Max rewinds.*

**Mr. Jefferson:** Now Max, since you've captured our interest and clearly want to join the conversation, can you please tell us the name of the process that gave birth to the first self-portraits?

**Max:** The Daguerreian Process. Invented by a French painter named...Louis Daguerre. Around 1830.

**Mr. Jefferson:** Somebody has been reading, as well as posing. Nice work, Max.

*Victoria gives Max an annoyed look.*

**Mr. Jefferson:** The Daguerreian Process made portraiture hugely popular, mainly because it gave the subjects clear defined features. You can learn more when you actually finish reading the assigned chapters. Max is so far, way ahead of everybody.

*Bell rings.*

**Mr. Jefferson:** And, guys, don't forget the deadline to submit a photo in the "Everyday Heroes" Contest. I will fly out with the winner to San Francisco where you'll be feted by the art world. It's great exposure and it can kickstart a career in photography. So Stella and Alyssa, get it together. Taylor don't hide, I'm still waiting for your entry too. And yes Max, I see you pretending not to see me.

**Max:** *(thinking)* Max, you are not crazy. You are not dreaming. It's time to be an everyday hero.

# # ## **Optional Conversation with Kate **
**Kate:** Nice answer, Max. Are you okay? You look pale.

**Max:** Kate, uh, did we talk at all today?

**Kate:** This is the first time. What's wrong?

**Max:** I'm sorry, I'm just tripping. Too much stress.

**Kate:** I know the feeling.

I have to go.# I have to go.

**Max:** I have to go... Too much happening right now.

**Kate:** Sure.

|-|I wish we didn't.I wish we didn't.

**Max:** I wish we didn't. I do have to go, but we can talk later if you want.

**Kate:** I'll see how I feel. Thanks, Max.

'''Jefferson and Victoria's conversation**

**Mr. Jefferson:''' Yes, Victoria, you still have to do your homework this week, even if you're submitting your photo for the competition. Everybody in class is turning a photo, so you see the dilemma.

**Victoria:** I know, Mr. Jefferson. I just worked so hard on this shot, and I'm sure you know what it's like to be consumed by your work. I just really think "Everyday Heroes" is an important cultural event and I want to represent Blackwell Academy.

**Mr. Jefferson:** You have just by participating, by putting yourself out there in the world. Well, no matter who wins, this is just a bump on a bigger road. I don't want anybody to feel excluded from this process. But I also want everybody to know that this photographic world is not for everybody. I had my moment in the camera eye and everybody should have that chance, right?

**Victoria:** Oh, totally. I only want to share whatever gifts I have with the world...
