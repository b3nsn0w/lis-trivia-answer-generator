''If Max rewinds and unplugs the home phone, William's cell phone rings.''

**William:** Hey, honey! I have no idea why the home phone didn't ring just now. I'm just making a fabulous breakfast with Chloe and Max. We're all going to work at the Two Whales... What? Oh, I didn't know you had to get groceries. Of course I'll come pick you up. Now I'll have an excuse to get a mocha. Be there shortly. Love you.

*William hangs up.*

**Max:** *(thinking, first time only)* I have to stop William from taking his car today.

**William:** Excuse me, ladies, I have to go rescue yonder queen at the Sav-Mart. She doth have many bags of delicious grub for us to feast upon.

**Chloe:** You are ridiculous.

**William:** *(laughs)* You'll be grateful for that someday. Shit, where are my keys?

*William searches around the room.*

**Chloe:** That's a dollar for the swear jar!

**William:** You mean your college fund! Keys, please...

**Chloe:** Another dollar for the swear jar!

**William:** You're bankrupting me!

*William pulls out a beeper to locate his keys.*

{{#tag:tabber|(Max doesn't hide them)(Max doesn't hide them)*If Max has not hidden the keys by the time William activates the beeper, the beeper will reveal that Max has the keys.*

**William:** Max, this is not the best time for a prank. Keys, please.

**Max:** Uh, I was just—um, are you sure Joyce is ready? Uh, let's just—let's just wait... I, um... Sorry. Here...

*Max hands the keys to William.*

**William:** I'll get you back someday.

{{!}}-{{!}}(Max hides them unsuccessfully)# (Max hides them unsuccessfully)''If Max hides them anywhere but out the window, in the sink, or out the back door, the beeper will sound, revealing to William the keys' location.*

**William:** I know I had those keys right here... I know it... Forgot all about you, little buddy... Release the keys! Of course. Last time I order from [SpyGuy](spyguy.md) Electronics...

*Max approaches him.''

**Max:** You can take the bus, right? The stop is right down the street!

**William:** This I can do. Good call, Max.

**Max:** Oh, yeah, the bus is great! It comes every 15 minutes and there'll be plenty of room for you and Joyce and groceries and it'll save the environment...

*Chloe walks out of the kitchen.*

**William:** You sold me already. I'm off to yonder bus stop. Joyce will love this.

*William waves goodbye and leaves the house.*

**Chloe:** Max, you are being so fucking strange. You feel okay?
