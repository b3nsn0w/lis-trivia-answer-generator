**Max:** For reals, Warren, this is between you and me, not social media.

**Warren:** Don't insult me. Max, go on.

**Max:** I told him the truth. A student had a gun.

**Max:** And did what? Gave you a stern lecture?

**Nathan:** Nobody...nobody lectures me. Everyone tries though... They try...

**Max:** You should talk to somebody, Nathan...

**Max:** Stop that! Right now!

**Chloe:** Max?

**Max:** Chloe?

**Nathan:** No way. You again?

*Warren jumps at Nathan and knocks him to the ground.*

**Max:** Warren!

**Warren:** Go, go! I got this!

*Max gets in the car. Nathan gets up and kicks the door closed.''

**Nathan:** Get your punk asses out of there now! Don't even try to run! Nobody messes with me! NOBODY!

*Max and Chloe drive away. In the background, David Madsen runs into the parking lot.*
