## **Cliff** 

*Chloe and Max fall to the ground. The lighthouse is behind them.*

**Chloe:** Max? Max, can you hear me? Please, say something.

**Max:** Chloe? I... I must have passed out... Sorry.

**Chloe:** Oh, thank God... Don't you ever do that again, okay?

**Max:** I swear... but that nightmare was so real... was so horrible...

''Chloe takes Max's arm and they stand up. Max watches the tornado, horrified.''

**Max:** This is my storm. I caused this... I caused all of this. I changed fate and destiny so much that... I actually did alter the course of everything. And all I really created was just death and destruction!

**Chloe:** Fuck all of that, okay? You were given a power. You didn't ask for it... and you saved me. Which had to happen, all of this did... except for what happened to Rachel. But without your power, we wouldn't have found her! Okay, so you're not the goddamn Time Master, but you're Maxine Caulfield... and you're amazing. Max, this is the only way.

*Chloe hands Max the photo she took of the blue butterfly.*

**Max:** I feel like I took this shot a thousand years ago.

**Chloe:** You... You could use that photo to change everything right back to when you took that picture... All that would take is for me to... to... *[Chloe holds her face in her hands]*

**Max:** Fuck that! No... no way! You are my number one priority now. You are all that matters to me.

**Chloe:** I know. You proved that over and over again... even though I don't deserve it. I'm so selfish... not like my mom... Look what she had to give up and live through... and she did. She deserves so much more than to be killed by a storm in a fucking diner. Even my step... father deserves her alive. There's so many more people in Arcadia Bay who should live... way more than me...

**Max:** Don't say that... I won't trade you.

**Chloe:** You're not trading me. Maybe you've just been delaying my real destiny... Look at how many times I've almost died or actually died around you. Look at what's happened in Arcadia Bay ever since you first saved me. I know I've been selfish, but for once I think I should accept my fate... our fate...

**Max:** Chloe...

**Chloe:** Max, you finally came back to me this week, and... you did nothing but show me your love and friendship. You made me smile and laugh, like I haven't done in years. Wherever I end up after this... in whatever reality... all those moments between us were real, and they'll always be ours. No matter what you choose, I know you'll make the right decision.

**Max:** Chloe... I can't make this choice...

''Chloe grabs Max's arms.''

**Chloe:** No, Max... You're the only one who can.

SACRIFICE CHLOE# SACRIFICE CHLOE

**Chloe:** Max... it's time...

**Max:** Chloe... I'm so, so sorry... I... I don't want to do this.

*Chloe hugs Max tightly.*

**Chloe:** I know, Max. But we have to. We have to save everybody, okay? And you'll make those fuckers pay for what they did to Rachel. Being together this week... it was the best farewell gift I could have hoped for. You're my hero, Max.

**Max:** Oh, Chloe... I'm gonna miss you so much.

*They share a long hug.*

**Chloe:** I'll always love you... Now, get out of here, please! Do it before I freak. And Max Caulfield? Don't you forget about me...

**Max:** Never.

*Max focuses on the photo and travels back in time. She takes the freshly printed photo from her camera and tosses it to the floor. She looks around the stall and waits for the bathroom door to open.*

**Nathan:** *[talking to himself in the mirror]* It's cool, Nathan... Don't stress, you're okay, bro, just... count to three. Don't be scared. You own this school... If I wanted, I could blow it up. You're the boss.

*The blue butterfly lands on the edge of the sink near Nathan. Chloe enters the bathroom.*

**Nathan:** So what do you want?

**Chloe:** I hope you checked the perimeter, as my step-ass would say. *[She opens the stall doors]* Now, let's talk bidness.

**Nathan:** I got nothing for you.

**Chloe:** Wrong. You got hella cash.

*Max sinks to the floor.*

**Nathan:** You don't know who the fuck I am or who you're messing around with!

**Chloe:** Where'd you get that? What are you doing? Come on, put that thing down!

**Nathan:** Don't EVER tell me what to do. I'm so SICK of people trying to control me!

**Chloe:** You are going to get in hella more trouble for this than drugs.

**Nathan:** Nobody would ever even miss your punk ass, would they?

**Chloe:** Get that gun away from me, psycho!

*Nathan accidentally pulls the trigger. Max lowers her head and her tears fall to the floor. Nathan, distressed, shakes Chloe repeatedly. The song [Spanish Sahara](spanish_sahara.md) begins to play.*
