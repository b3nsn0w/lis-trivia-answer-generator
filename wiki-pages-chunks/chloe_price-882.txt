## Biography 
[Max's Diary](max_s_diary.md) entry about Chloe is as follows:

''"Then there's Chloe Price. What do you say to your best friend after five years of silence? After finding out you saved her life in a bathroom? NOTHING. I feel so lame for not staying in touch... or even text. I have no idea how to process seeing Chloe like this again. For one thing, she looks so similar but so different... She's all grown up now, but it doesn't seem like she's only one year older than me.*

*I absolutely love her blue hair and punk clothes. It makes sense she would become a rebel. She still kinda looks like a pirate. Except one who stage dives. I know she's angry with me because of her body language. I'm glad I can still see the old Chloe in there. Or is that the young Chloe? I'm sure she's still messed up about her dad dying. I would be too. That was a terrible time for Chloe and Joyce.*

*I feel bad because I wonder if I was happy to move away just to avoid the grief... Speaking of grief, it's clear she's all mixed up with [Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md)'s shit. I have no idea what's going on between them, but I am going to find out, no matter what."''

## Background 
Chloe and Max grew up together in Arcadia Bay with their families, where they were close childhood friends who used to always hang around each other and played pirates at their homes or in the woods, dreaming of their future and the adventures they would experience together.  

We discover that Chloe had a cat named [Bongo](bongo.md) who died in 2008.  

In 2008, Max was with Chloe at [Price Household (2008)](her_house.md) when her father tragically died in a car crash. Although Max was supportive at the time, her family moved away to Seattle, leaving Chloe to deal with her grief alone. Chloe always used to smile and laugh, but gradually became more resentful of her life without her father and Max. Not long after the loss of her father, Chloe's mother Joyce and David Madsen became lovers. David Madsen is a military veteran and Head of Security at Blackwell Academy whom Chloe immediately despised. From there, Chloe started getting more rebellious, hanging around with bad boys, taking drugs and running away from home, making the [American Rust Junkyard](junkyard.md) her "home away from Hell." She grew more and more frustrated with Arcadia Bay and conceived the desire to escape from her home town. Her emotional temperament took physical form, as she gradually changed her outward appearance to the punk-rock style of today. She often got into varying degrees of mischief and thus earned a bad reputation with the local police over the years.  

Chloe attended Blackwell Academy until at least 2010Blackwell documents in both Chloe's and Alternative Chloe's rooms dated 2010 reveal that Chloe attended Blackwell Academy at least since then., where she eventually found support from another local girl, Rachel Amber, striking up a firm friendship.A [Media:Note-chloesroom-postcardback.png](postcard.md) in Chloe's room written by Rachel on August 24, 2011, reveals that they've been close friends for at least two years. Her student file reveals she had a 1.7 GPA, taking part in pranks and vandalism before being thrown out of the Academy about three years before Max began attending. Chloe and her new best friend planned to run away together to California to start a new life before Rachel's disappearance prior to the start of the 2013 Fall term when Max started as a senior. Chloe planned to leave Arcadia Bay without paying Frank back.  

Chloe originally had long strawberry blond hair before cutting it. She began to dye it some years ago during her time at Blackwell, starting with a chunk at first, as evident from a picture of her on her birthday with David and on her Blackwell Academy Record photo. Her hair gradually progressed from a large blue streak to entirely blue. She also got a sleeve tattoo and her belly pierced.
