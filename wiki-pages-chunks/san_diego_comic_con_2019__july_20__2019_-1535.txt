Here is a section of the wiki page for San Diego Comic Con 2019 (July 20, 2019):

give you a bit of a hard question now. So, some of the players out there did mention that they felt a little bit forced into some aspects of the game. So, for example, in Episode 2, going to the [Christmas Market](christmas_market.md), or in Episode 3, going along with the heist. How do you respond to that sort of question?

**Raoul:** Yeah, I think it's like all things: to find the right balance. And you've got also production aspect to take into account. It cost a lot to have a [wolf?] scene created, and maybe half of the players see it or not, so... for example, you're examples are great. For the Christmas market, we ask... we discuss a lot with the team to say, okay, maybe you can't go, but how are you going to bring the cops, et cetera? But as we wanted the player to have this feeling of this small town, to meet the drifters, et cetera, we decided to go to the market in every [video cuts to splice sentence together. Unintelligible couple of words]. And we had some discussion before the market to explain why Sean maybe doesn't want to go, but we'll go anyway, because of unintelligible few words], et cetera, so it's to find this balance to... I know players sometimes want to say, "I don't want to do that, and I don't have the option I want," et cetera, but it's also the way you write narrative games sometimes. We come to a full, open world... We would love to have something maybe with more freedom, but sometimes you-- I would say I prefer to stick to some choices to be sure that those ones are accurate with our characters, so... Of course, you have some frustration; I always have when I play a game and I can't do the thing I'm thinking about, but, yeah, it's the way we tried to design it.
**Lucy:** Of course. Let's discuss Daniel, because, this time, unlike Life is Strange 1, you are not playing as the person with the power. Your younger brother has the power. So, why did you take that sort of route, and what kind of influences do you have over your brother as well? Because you have the little wolves in the bottom corner. Whenever you do something, it either affects Sean or Daniel or both. So, how does that work?

**Jean-Luc:** In Life is Strange, the power - the supernatural effect - is always linked to the story, you know? In the first season, Max was afraid of growing up. She doesn't want to grow up and become an adult. That's why the power of rewinding time was linked to maybe her weakness, you know? In the second season, the main theme is not becoming of age; the main theme of Life is Strange 2 is about education. That's why we gave the power to Daniel, because we wanted for the player to experience what Daniel can be if you act too good with him, if you are teaching-- if you are raising him well. Or, on the other side, if you are showing him the bad example, what Daniel can [video clip cuts off his sentence completely].

**Lucy:** Music is obviously a massive part of the Life is Strange games. I know the first game people absolutely loved the soundtrack. How does it differ? Because, obviously, it changes with the character's tastes, so Max, for example, isn't gonna have the same music tastes as Sean. But how did you decide to kind of construct the Life is Strange 2 soundtrack?

**Raoul:** Music is really, really important for us. I'm the Music Supervisor of the project, so I wanted to continue to work with [Jonathan Morali](jonathan_morali.md), from {{wiki|Syd Matters}}, in Life is Strange 2. I really love his work, and I think players also love the soundtrack of the first season.

**Lucy:** Absolutely. Definitely.

**Raoul:** So we have continued with him, but we wanted also to explore new themes, and as it's a road trip structure, maybe have the score changing a lot more than in the first season. So, for each episode, you've got like maybe two or three themes composed by Jonathan linked to the characters you meet, linked to the seasons, linked to the environments. It was really important to change a bit with-- And I think Captain Spirit is a good example of what we tried to do. So, in Captain Spirit, you've got the music from [Death with Dignity](sufjan_stevens.md), a folk artist, in the beginning, and in the very end when you see the power and the end of Captain Spirit, you got this electronic music from French artist [Parade](rone.md). And it was this evolution we wanted to show coming from the first season [which was] more folk, and with season 2 with electronic sound in it. So it was the idea for Captain Spirit to create a link between the two seasons, and we wanted also to continue to have licensed tracks in this season 2. So, like you said, all the tracks we pick are linked to the characters. We want to tell something about the characters with the tracks we choose. So Max was listening to Syd Matters or [Crosses](jos__gonz_lez.md) songs - so very neo-folk music - when Sean is listening to [On The Flip Of A Coin](the_streets.md) - a hip-hop artist from England. So I think it tells us something about the characters. Like Chloe was listening to PJ Harvey... artists like that. In the first season, the music you listen to is really telling something about you, so it's interesting to use it this way and also to have licensed tracks on top of things, like in cinema or in movies. So, having this cinematographic feeling, I think, a song - existing song - can add a lot of emotion to a moment, to a scene. So, it was the idea to continue like this.

**Lucy:** How does the process work? So, is it more skewed towards-- Raoul, do you really want a song to be in a scene, and then, Jean-Luc, do you have to write around that song? Or, Jean-Luc, do you write the section and then, Raoul, you pick the track to go along with that?
**Jean-Luc:** When I'm writing, most of the time, I'm writing without music to [not] be disturbed, to be really into a scene. But,
