Here is a section of the wiki page for Frank Bowers:

## Background 
He used to attend [Blackwell Academy](blackwell_academy.md), but was likely expelled. He also used to bet on dogfight matches, but later had a revelation and saved several of the dogs, including his current companion, Pompidou.

Frank grew up in a religious family. His father, who was strongly religious, went to jail when he was young.

## Episode One - "[Episode 1: Chrysalis](chrysalis.md)" 
On her way to meet Warren on the [Blackwell Parking Lot](blackwell_parking_lot.md), she comes across Frank's dirty RV at the inner corner of the parking lot, and his dog Pompidou sleeping in front of it. Max can draw a face in the dirty window of Frank's RV and take an [Optional Photos](optional_photo.md) of it.

Later, we learn that Chloe is in great debt to Frank - she owes him $3,000 she borrowed to cover the cost of repairing her banged up [Chloe's Truck](truck.md), in order to escape Arcadia Bay. Frank is demanding his money from her. It is partially due to Frank that Chloe needed to attempt to steal from [Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md) to get money; in part to pay back Frank, and in part to escape the Bay with Rachel.

Although we do not meet Frank in this episode, he is shown in the ending scene with Pompidou outside the RV during the snowstorm.

## Episode Two - "[Episode 2: Out of Time](out_of_time.md)" 
At the [Two Whales Diner](two_whales_diner.md), Frank's RV is parked in the parking lot outside the diner with Frank sleeping on a chair and Frank's dog keeping watch outside. If Max tries to approach the RV or its occupants outside, Frank's dog Pompidou will bark loudly. Frank will tell Pompidou not to bark anymore and Max will back off.

Inside the diner, if Max speaks to a police officer, he will warn Max to stay away from the RV and tells her that the owner, Frank, is a sketchy character. As Max and Chloe are leaving the diner, Frank will wake up and watch them drive away from a distance.

At the [American Rust Junkyard](american_rust_junkyard.md), Frank will investigate the sound of gunshots and breaking glass. Upon seeing Max and Chloe together, Frank will call them "{{Wiki|Thelma and Louise|Thelma and Louise}}" and "{{Wiki|Bonnie and Clyde|Bonnie and Clyde}}". Chloe tries to ignore him but he continues to mock them, and starts to compare himself to Chloe. Chloe takes offense at the comparison, claiming they’re nothing alike. Frank reminds her that Frank and Chloe both need money and she owes him.

While Chloe is assuring him that she’ll pay him back, Frank's attention is drawn towards Max, who is hiding [David Madsen](david_madsen.md)’s gun behind her back. He approaches her and asks what she’s hiding. Chloe notices Frank has a blue bracelet on his right wrist and interrupts, demanding to know where Frank got it.

Frank claims the bracelet was from a friend. Chloe recognizes the bracelet to be Rachel Amber’s bracelet and accuses him of stealing. When she tries to snatch the bracelet, Frank pulls out his switchblade, pointing it at Chloe and threatening to cut her. Frank notices that Max now has the gun pointed at him and she asks him to step back. However, Frank thinks Max doesn't look capable enough to shoot a gun and tries to step closer to snatch the gun from Max's hands, saying Max is kidding and she should put the gun down. Max has the option to shoot or not to shoot Frank.
