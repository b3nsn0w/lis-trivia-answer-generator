##  Lyrics 

: I got sunburnt waiting for the jets to land
: Circus people with hairy little hands
: Come on boys strike up the army band
: I got sunburnt waiting for the jets

: How do you feel?
: How do you feel?
: I can't seem to see through solid marble eyes

: Fiery pianos wash up on a foggy coast
: Squeaky old organs have given up the ghost
: Fire them up and kill the pianos
: There's creaky old organs burning on the coast

: How do you feel?
: How do you feel?
: I can't seem to breathe with a rusted metal heart
: I can't seem to see through solid marble eyes
