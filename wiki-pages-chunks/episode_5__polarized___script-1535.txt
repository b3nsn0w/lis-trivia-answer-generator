What did you do?

Terrible choice.Terrible choice.
**Max:** Chloe, I'm... I'm going to tell you the truth, no matter what. I changed your past and I had to make a terrible choice, and I... I...

**Chloe:** Max. Please tell me... I won't be mad at you...

**Max:** I was able to go back in time... to the last day William was alive. I stopped him from leaving, but... But you ended up in a car crash instead.

**Chloe:** You saw my dad again?

**Max:** You... you were completely paralyzed. And you were in pain. You were slowly dying, and you… you asked me to… end your life.

**Chloe:** God, Max... That must have been... That must have been awful for you... I'm so sorry I had to ask you that...

**Max:** It was worse for you. But I had no idea what would happen, and... as usual, I messed everything up, and… I never want to hurt you, ever. You have to believe me.

**Chloe:** Of course I do. Do you think I would even know how to handle that situation? Nobody would... The important thing is that we're together again.

{{!}}-{{!}}Nothing.# Nothing.
**Max:** Uh... nothing. I mean, whenever I use my rewind, I create new timelines, new destinies...

**Chloe:** Then you can't be sure of anything! That's why I'm going to take out Jefferson... and that will be our reality.

**Max:** No, no... Chloe, hold on! Chloe!

**Max:** You're right. That's why you should come with me so we can stay together... and stay alive.

**Chloe:** I hear you, Max... but do you think we should let Jefferson get away with torture and murder?

**Max:** Of course not! If we tell David, he'll believe us and he can actually stop him... right?
