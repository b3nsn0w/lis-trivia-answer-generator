Here is a section of the wiki page for Episode 1: Chrysalis - Script:

## '''[Jefferson](jefferson.md)'s Lecture'* 
*Max wakes up and examines her surroundings.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Whoa! That was so surreal.

**Mr. Jefferson:** Alfred Hitchcock famously called film, "little pieces of time" but he could be talking about photography, as he likely was.

**Max:** *(thinking)'' Okay... I'm in class...

''[Stella](stella.md)'s pen falls on the floor and she reaches down to pick it up.*

**Max:** *(thinking)'' Everything's cool... I'm okay...

**Mr. Jefferson:** These pieces of time can frame us in our glory and our sorrow; from light to shadow; from color to chiaroscuro...

*[Taylor](taylor.md) throws a paper ball at [Kate Marsh](kate.md).*

**Mr. Jefferson:** Now, can you give me an example of a photographer who perfectly captured the human condition in black and white? Anybody? Bueller?

''[Victoria](victoria.md)'s phone vibrates.*

**Max:** *(thinking)'' I didn't fall asleep, and... that sure didn't feel like a dream... Weird.

**Victoria:** Diane Arbus.

**Mr. Jefferson:** There you go, Victoria! Why Arbus?

**Victoria:** Because of her images of hopeless faces. You feel like, totally haunted by the eyes of those sad mothers and children.

**Mr. Jefferson:** She saw humanity as tortured, right? And frankly, it's bullshit. Shh, keep that to yourself. Seriously though, I could frame any one of you in a dark corner, and capture you in a moment of desperation. And any one of you could do that to me. Isn't that too easy? Too obvious? What if Arbus chose to capture people at the height of their beauty or innocence? She had a brilliant eye, so she could have taken another approach.

**Victoria:** I have to admit, I'm not a big fan of her work. I prefer... Robert Frank.

**Mr. Jefferson:** Me too, Victoria. He captured the essence of post-war, beat America. And there was honesty about the economic conditions of the era, but a beauty in the struggle. You don't have beauty without a beat. Which explains why Frank was Kerouac's photographic muse and both were the great chroniclers of the 1950's. Well... We've all seen that iconic shot of Kerouac on the balcony—and if you haven't, shame, shame—capturing the romantic urban solitude of the 20th century poet. You dig? Now, contrast Frank's stark Americana, with Salvador Dali's surrealist photographs. Like Cocteau, he was a true renaissance man, and his famous self-portraits are famous early examples of that truly awful word you pesky kids love so much, the "selfie"... And it's a great tradition, and I wholeheartedly fight for your right to self-expression. Or selfie-expression. Heh, sorry, I know. So if anybody wants to question the portrait as modern narcissism, they could go back hundreds of years to blame society. Speaking of questions, I bet you thought I'd talk all the way until the bell rang. It's your turn to lecture us. Now, based on the chapters I have no doubt you all memorized, who can tell me the name of the actual process that led to the birth of the self-portrait? Anybody? ... This does not bode well. Just jump right in with an answer. This was in the chapters you read. You did read the chapters, right? Your silence is deafening. If this were a photo, I'd call it a still life.

*Max looks at her entry photo.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Look at this crap! How can I show this to Mr. Jefferson? I can hear the class laughing at me now.

''Max takes a selfie with [Max's Camera](her_camera.md).''

**Mr. Jefferson:** Shh, I believe Max has taken what you kids call a "selfie"... A dumb word for a wonderful photographic tradition. And Max... has a gift. Of course, as you all know, the photo portrait has been popular since the early 1800's. Your generation was not the first to use images for "selfie-expression." Sorry. I couldn't resist. The point remains that the portraiture has always been a vital aspect of art, and photography, for as long as it's been around. Now, Max, since you've captured our interest and clearly want to join the conversation, can you please tell us the name of the process that gave birth to the first self-portraits?

You're asking me?# You're asking me?

**Max:** You're asking me? Let me think... Um...

|-|I did know...I did know...

**Max:** I did know! ...But I kinda forgot.

**Mr. Jefferson:** *(angrily)* You either know this or not, Max. Is there anybody here who knows their stuff?

**Victoria:** Louis Daguerre was a French painter who created "daguerreotypes" a process that gave portraits a sharp reflective style, like a mirror. *[turns to Max]* Now you're totally stuck in the Retro Zone. Sad face.

*Taylor laughs.*

**Mr. Jefferson:** Very good, Victoria. The Daguerreian Process brought out fine detail in people's faces, making them extremely popular from the 1800's onward. The first American daguerreotype self-portrait was done by Robert Cornelius. You can find out all about him... In your textbook. Or even... online.

*Bell rings.*

**Mr. Jefferson:** And guys, don't forget the deadline to submit a photo in the "[Everyday Heroes Photo Contest](everyday_heroes.md)" contest. I'll fly out with the winner to San Francisco where you'll be feted by the art world. It's great exposure, and it can kickstart a career in photography. So, Stella and Alyssa, get it together. Taylor, don't hide. I'm still waiting for your entry, too. And yes, Max, I see you pretending not to see me.

*Victoria walks over to Mr. Jefferson.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Victoria doesn't waste a second kissing ass...
