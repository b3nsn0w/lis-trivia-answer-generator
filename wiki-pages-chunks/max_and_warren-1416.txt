Here is a section of the wiki page for Max and Warren:

show up in the Dark Room sequence of the nightmare, as one of people flirting with Chloe. Depending on Max's actions earlier, he will insult her in different ways. He also shows up at the diner, and he'll be one of the people who plead for Max to save them.

During the final scene of the game, Max can check her text messages and see Warren's past messages, repeatedly asking for her well-being. There were also undelivered messages to Warren, where Max was warning him about the storm and that he should tell everyone to take shelter as soon as possible.

Warren also can be seen in the Sacrifice Chloe ending along with Kate Marsh and other students as they attend Chloe's funeral with Max. Considering that Max was questioning her feelings for Chloe (and Chloe's feelings for her) at the [Easily Missed Details (Life is Strange)#Max.27s_Last_Journal_Entries](end_of_her_journal.md), it can be assumed that they remain as friends.

He is presumed to be dead in the Sacrifice Arcadia Bay ending. ## Alternative Timeline 
[File:Warren and Stella.jpg](thumb.md)
Warren first appears in the [Alternative Timeline](alternative_timeline.md) when Max finds herself sitting on the main campus lawn at Blackwell Academy and discovers that she is a member of the Vortex Club and that Victoria is now her friend. She spies Warren nearby, who now appears to be dating [Stella Hill](stella_hill.md).

When they are at Chloe's house, Chloe asks Max if she is dating anyone at Blackwell. Max can either say that "Not really, no. There are some cute boys there, but you know me... I'm too damn shy" or that she's busy with school and photography. Chloe replies that this is stupid because there are surely a lot of boys at Blackwell crushing on Max. Max then mentions Warren and the fact that she was originally supposed to go out with him, but he's not into her anymore or that he is with someone else. Chloe says that it's "his loss" and jokes that there is still "plenty of fish left in the bay".

## Trivia 
*At the beginning of the game, Max says she considers Warren to be her Supercool Geek Brother.
* The "line" Warren tries to use on Max in the parking lot; "Art is Science, Science is Art" is actually a motto or a quote by {{Wiki|Leonardo da Vinci}}.
*Warren is Max's best friend amongst Blackwell students.
*Warren, who self-proclaims to be Max's "White Knight", certainly tries to deserve the title. He saves Max from two confrontations with Nathan and ultimately saves Chloe's life indirectly by providing Max the last surviving photo of a timeline when Chloe is alive and well, after Mark Jefferson burned Max's diary that contained all of Max's photos.
*In spite of Max referring to Warren as having the same age as her, Warren is actually two years younger than Max.
*At a given point in the game, depending on what Max answers, Chloe will jokingly say that Warren is "friendzoned" by Max. 
*Warren seems to be a "lightweight" when it comes to alcohol consumption. Max and Chloe find Warren at the entrance of the [ End of the World Party](_end_of_the_world_party.md), visibly drunk after drinking just half a beer. Due to the "drug environment" that surrounds Vortex Club parties there is also the possibility that someone spiked his beer.
*Warren, like Max, seems to be a fan of World of Warcraft.
*Warren, in spite of being nothing but supportive of Max, and always kind and friendly, seems to have a darker side. He goes out of control when he beats up Nathan, which both Max and Chloe seem to notice and disapprove in private. 
*He also waits for Max in the courtyard in the beginning of [Episode 2: Out of Time](episode_2.md) and even develops a photo that he and Max took together, which he puts up in his locker.
*The above reasons might be an explanation to Warren's behavior during [Max's Nightmare](max_s_nightmare.md). While in the nightmare, Warren's speech will be more aggressive—almost violent—and he will have a locker full of crudely altered photos of Max.
*Max may not be that oblivious about Warren's romantic feelings for her. After a reply from Alyssa warning Max to be careful, because she might make Brooke jealous, Max quickly replies, "I'll just pretend I have no idea what you mean." Also, after Warren's movie invitation, she will express concern in her diary about him making a move on her if the invitation was accepted. If Max declined, she will write in her diary that one of the reasons is that she doesn't want to lead him on.
*Even if Max shows no inclination towards Warren whatsoever, Chloe will always consider Warren her rival in the dispute for Max affection. Chloe will ask about Warren in the pool scene and if Max kisses her, Chloe will jokingly say she will be texting Warren about him being out of the loop, and she actually follows through with the deed.
*Max considers Warren to be one of the smartest students at Blackwell. In [Episode 3: Chaos Theory](episode_3.md), when Max and Chloe gain access to student files, her opinion is confirmed by Warren's 4.0 GPA scoring. His report states he is "considered an exemplary student and represents a long tradition of excellence in science at Blackwell."
