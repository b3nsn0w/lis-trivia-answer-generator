Here is a section of the wiki page for Episode 2: Out of Time - Script:

didn't tell me anything...

*The class bell rings and Jefferson enters.*

**Jefferson:** Okay, I know you love me, but if you're not in this class, beat it. Everybody else, please sit down.

**Warren:** Maybe I'll see you later?

*Warren and Nathan leave as the other students take their seats.*

**Jefferson:** We have a lot to cover today, and so little time, as usual. I see all the usual suspects here... Anybody seen Kate Marsh?

**Victoria:** I think everybody has seen Kate Marsh by now.

*Taylor laughs.*

**Alyssa:** She's...not feeling good.

**Jefferson:** Sounds like you're giggling about a video gone viral. Maybe it involves a student or a friend. I wonder how it would feel to have false images of yourself shot out all over the world for people to judge...

*Max receives a text from Chloe.*

(If player uses the on-screen prompt to check the message)(If player uses the on-screen prompt to check the message)''In the Original Edition, the phone's display is shown on-screen for a split second before Jefferson interrupts. In the Remastered Edition, Jefferson catches Max looking at her phone once the player leaves the text message UI.*

**Jefferson:** No smartphones in class, Max! Put that away.

*After Max puts her phone away, Jefferson continues his lecture from the point it was interrupted.''

**Jefferson:** Usually people need something to judge so they never take a good look at themselves. We can thank reality TV for some of that. In the end, we can only blame ourselves for participating... Speaking of participation, there are a few souls here who have yet to enter a photo in the contest. Like Max Caulfield, for example. Who I know can't wait to enter, right? I'm sure you read the syllabus like it was a Harry Potter book, so you must know today we're studying chiaroscuro; that beautiful word about the contrast between light and dark, the shadowplay that gives photography such...visual power. It's basic yin and yang. Black and white images are effective precisely because of their contrast. Although we don't technically "see" in monochrome--

*Zachary bursts into the classroom.*

**Zachary:** Yo, some crazy shit is going down at the girls' dorm! Check it!

**Jefferson:** Zachary, do not come into my class like that ever again--

*All the students begin to leave their desks and head outside.*

**Jefferson:** Listen! Everybody remain seated--

*The students leave and the classroom is empty.*

**Jefferson:** Dismissed...

# ## **Dormitories** 
*Girl shrieks in the background.*

**Evan:** Did you see that?

**Dana:** Is this for real?

**Logan:** Bitch flipped out!

**Courtney:** I didn't think she was that messed up...

**Dana:** Oh, my God!

'''Students' Comments About Kate**

**Zachary:** Who is that up there?

**Daniel:** Oh, no! Is that Kate?

**Trevor:** I hope not.

**Male Student:** Holy shit! That chick is right on the ledge!

**Dana:** If she jumps, she might not die...

**Juliet:** Yes, she will.

**Alyssa:** I cannot believe this, Brooke...

**Dana:** No! No!

**Trevor:** How long has she been up there?

**Evan:** Long enough.

**Dana:''' Don't! Come down! Get down!

**Brooke:** Poor Kate. That fucking viral video.

**Daniel:** Man, this is so not why I came to Blackwell!

*If Max sees Kate on the roof before she jumps.*

**Max: **Kate! No! Oh, God, I have to do something to help her!

*Kate jumps off the roof.*

**Max (thinking): **''She can't die. She can't!*

*Max rewinds, but she gets an intense headache and her nose begins to bleed.*

**Max (thinking):** *Not again...not now...*

*Kate jumps off the roof again.*

**Max (thinking):** *I have to try something...I won't be able to rewind again and again...*

*As Max rewinds again, suddenly everything stops. Everyone and everything but Max is frozen in time.*

**Max (thinking):** *Keep...going...Max... You...can...do it...*

*Max walks toward the dormitory building and heads up to the roof.*
