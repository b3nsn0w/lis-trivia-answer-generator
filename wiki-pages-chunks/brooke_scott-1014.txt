Here is a section of the wiki page for Brooke Scott:

## Episode Four - "[Episode 4: Dark Room](dark_room.md)" 
Brooke is seen flying her drone outside of the Blackwell dormitories. When approached by Max, she will comment on how ironic it is that Warren is taking Max to the movies if Max accepted Warren's offer, but she will loudly talk about her plans to go to the drive-in with Warren if Max turned down his offer. Max may ask Brooke to let her fly the drone once again. If Max accepted Warren's invitation, Brooke will deny the request, saying that Max "doesn't have time" to fly the drone. If Max turned down Warren's offer, Brooke will happily allow Max to fly the drone, saying she needs to look at the exact time of her date with Warren.

Brooke is later seen at the [End of the World Party](end_of_the_world_party.md). If Max encouraged [Daniel DaCosta](daniel_dacosta.md) to go the party, Brooke will be talking to him about future plans to take a road trip to an art museum in [Portland](portland.md). If Max accepted Warren's invitation to go to the drive-in, she and Max can sort out the issues she has with Max and become friends.

## Episode Five - "[Episode 5: Polarized](polarized.md)" 
Brooke appears in the diner scene ofÂ [Max's Nightmare](max_s_nightmare.md). She is seen sitting on the floor and texting. When Max approaches her, she says that she hopes Max does the right thing.

If Max chooses to sacrifice Arcadia Bay, Brooke is presumed to be among the town's casualties.

## Alternative Timeline 
Brooke is still a student at Blackwell Academy in the [Alternative Timeline (Life is Strange)](alternative_timeline.md) Max created when she prevents Chloe's father, [William Price](william_price.md), from dying in a car accident. Brooke can be seen sitting down on the right side of the school bus Max catches when she makes her way to [Alternative Price Household](chloe_s_house.md). When the sight of three dead humpback whales comes into view on the [beach](beach.md), Brooke stands up to look at them through a window on Max's side.

## Relationships
#

## Friends 
* [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) (**Determinant**) - Depending on Max's actions, Brooke can be a friend to Max. She will allow Max to fly her drone in Episode 1 if Max looks at the packaging to see what the drone is called. She will allow it once more in Episode 4 if Max turned down Warren's offer to go to the movies.
* [Daniel DaCosta](daniel_dacosta.md) (**Determinant**) - Regardless of Max convincing Daniel to attend the party, Daniel and Brooke do have a conversation about Kate. If Max does convince him to go, he and Brooke will be seen together at the party.

#

## Romantic 
* [Warren Graham](warren_graham.md) - Brooke clearly has feelings for Warren, as she is jealous of Max if Max accepts Warren's invitation to the drive-in and will accept the invitation herself if Max rejects. The other students at Blackwell seem to be aware of Brooke's feelings for Warren. The two also have a common interest in science. When Max helps Warren with an experiment in Ms. Grant's class, Brooke responds sarcastically from the back of the class in response to Max and Warren's mutual praise of each other: 

**Warren:** "Eureka! She's got it!"

**Max:** "No, you got it."

**Warren:** "Don't be so modest, Doctor Caulfield..."

**Brooke:** "Oh you guys really broke the bounds of science."
* [Daniel DaCosta](daniel_dacosta.md) (**Determinant**) - Brooke can end up discussing plans to go to an art museum in Portland with Daniel if you successfully convince him to go to the "End of the World" party.

#

## Enemies 
* [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) (**Determinant**) - Brooke is obviously jealous of Max due to Warren being more interested in her. Depending on Max's actions (namely, accepting Warren's movie date invitation), Brooke may be hostile toward Max in Episode 4. However, it is possible to reconcile and Brooke will agree to schedule a "drone date" with Max. Regardless of Max's decisions, it should be noted that Brooke does respect Max for trying to save Kate and maintains a certain amount of politeness.
