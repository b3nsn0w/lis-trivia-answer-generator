distracted.**Max:** You look distracted. Everything cool?

**Brooke:** I was riveted by that weird snow flurry yesterday.

**Max:** I can't tell if you're being serious or not... Um, since I'm a science noob, I was wondering if you could explain it...

**Brooke:** I'm serious. Even meteorologists can't explain that snow. I bet Warren can. Did you talk to him yet?

I will later.I will later.**Max:** I will later.

**Brooke:** Lucky you. I'm sure he'll track you down, Max. I'll see you around.

|-|No.# No.**Max:** No, not at all. He's my friend, not my mother.

**Brooke:** True. And Warren really loves to talk meteorology with me, since I'm one of the few who can talk back. Talk to you later, Max.

*If Max tries to talk to Brooke again*

**Brooke:** I don't have time, Max. I can't talk now.

**Brooke:** Really, Max?

**Max:** Oh! Uh... Hey, Kate. Sorry about yesterday.

**Kate:** Yeah, I'm sorry you didn't do anything to help. But you're just like everybody else here...

**Max:** That's not true, I wanted to help, but, but--

**Kate:** Whatever, it's done...

**Max:** Hey, Kate. How are you doing?

**Kate:** I'm here. Thanks again for standing up for me yesterday. I needed that.

**Max:** Anytime. That guy has issues.

**Kate:** Doesn't everybody here?

**Kate:** By the way, Max, do you still have my copy of "The October Country"?

**Max:** Oh. Yes, of course. It's great so far. I didn't realize Bradbury was such a poet.

**Kate:** Can you please bring it back to my room this morning? I just need to take some notes for class.

**Max:** Absolutely. I'll bring it by later.

*Max begins to take a shower.*

*Victoria and Taylor enter and approach Kate.*

**Victoria:** What's up, Kate?

**Kate:** School.

**Taylor:** That's it?

**Victoria:** That video of you clubbing didn't look like homework...

**Kate:** Victoria, that wasn't me...

**Taylor:** Oh, my God. Right.

**Victoria:** Don't be shy. I think it's awesome you set a tongue record on video...

*Taylor laughs.*

**Kate:** You're going to be sorry someday.

*Kate leaves.*

**Victoria:** Oh, boohoo, I'm sorry you're a viral slut. I'm sure she had fun.

**Taylor:** Looks like it.

**Victoria:** I know Nathan hooked her up. And you know he has the good shit.

**Taylor:** Preach it, sista.

*Victoria examines herself in the mirror.*

**Victoria:** Yuck. I still have goddamn paint all over my face.

Made fun of VictoriaMade fun of Victoria**Victoria:** "Max Selfie" thought she was a badass taking that picture. I shoulda beat her down.

**Taylor:** That was so uncool.

**Victoria:** She's jealous because Mark--Mr. Jefferson knows I'm going to win the "Everyday Heroes" contest. He thinks Max is a joke.

|-|Comforted Victoria# Comforted Victoria**Victoria:** Good thing my faithful minions took their sweet time bringing me a towel...

**Taylor:** We ran all the way--

**Victoria:** Give it a rest, Taylor. Now I know if I'm in an accident I won't rely on you or Courtney for help. You can hang out with Kate...or Max.

**Taylor:** She's a weirdo with that dumb camera.

**Victoria:** I hate that "I'm so quirky" crap. Anyway. Let's leave the link to Kate's video so everybody gets a chance to see her in action...

**Taylor:** You are such an evil beeatch. I love it!

*Victoria pull out a tube of lipstick and writes the link to the video of Kate on the mirror.*

*Taylor laughs, then she and Victoria leave.*

*Max puts her PJs back on and steps out of the shower.*

**Max (thinking):** I better get dressed, then go give back Kate's book.

*Optional: Max washes her face at the sink.*

**Unknown female student (from inside the shower):** Hello?! Water!

**Max:** Sorry, I forgot!

*Optional: Erase the link written on the mirror.*

**Max (thinking):** Even if I can stop one person from watching it, it's worth it.

''Max leaves the bathroom and returns to her own room (if Max left Victoria's photos in the rearranged state, Max's slate will say "LOOK AT ME: I AM MAX SELFIE!" and show a drawing with a photo of a turd. Max can erase this and draw a new picture on her slate).*
