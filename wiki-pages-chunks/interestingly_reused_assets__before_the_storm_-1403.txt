#  Interestingly Reused Assets (Before the Storm) 

Many of the **game assets** from *[Life is Strange](life_is_strange.md)* by [Don't Nod](don_t_nod.md) were reused in *[Life is Strange: Before the Storm](life_is_strange__before_the_storm.md)* by [Deck Nine Games](deck_nine_games.md). This article lists some interestingly reused game assets.

## Episode One - "[Episode 1: Awake](awake.md)"

## License Plate 
The **978 AM** license plate was originally seen in [David Madsen](david_madsen.md)'s [David's Garage](garage.md) in *Life is Strange*'s [Episode 2: Out of Time](second_episode.md). In *Before the Storm*, the same plate appears in the [Old Mill](old_mill.md) behind the bar area.A dirtier version of the plate could also be found in the [Hideout](hideout.md) at the [American Rust Junkyard](junkyard.md) in the original game. The 978 AM plate was one of the few plates in *Life is Strange* which did not appear to be [References (Life is Strange)](referencing.md) a famous TV show. As this particular plate is being reused at this location, this may be causing a minor inconsistency between *Before the Storm* and *Life is Strange*.
