Here is a section of the wiki page for David Madsen:

## Episode Five - "[Episode 5: Polarized](polarized.md) " 
After changing the past twice and finding herself again in the [Dark Room (Location)](dark_room.md), no matter who Max supported, David used the clues found by Chloe and Max's investigation and successfully tracked to the source behind the attacks on students and found himself in the Dark Room, fighting with Mark Jefferson. With the guidance and a bit of manipulation of the playing field by Max, David successfully knocks out Mark Jefferson and frees Max. David reconciles with Max (regardless of which options were picked in the conversation) and tells her he also suspected Nathan in his role behind Kate's (attempted) suicide and should have apprehended them sooner. He also admits that he was being too harsh on Kate.

However, if Max is to reveal to David of Mark's killing of Chloe, David will shoot Mark in the head for revenge. Otherwise, he will be continuing the investigations at the desk in the Dark Room.

Max can tell Joyce that David needs her in the diner.

When the timeline has been rewound through [Warren Graham](warren_graham.md)'s photo to prevent Chloe's death at the hands of Jefferson, Chloe and Max reported their investigations to David. David promptly tracked Mr. Jefferson to the Dark Room and had him arrested with the help of the police.

David later appears in the maze area of [Max's Nightmare](max_s_nightmare.md) where he is among the people hunting down Max.

He was confirmed to be one of the sole survivors of the storm along with Chloe and Max.

If the timeline is reversed and Chloe had been shot dead by Nathan back in Blackwell, David is the first who enters the bathroom and arrests Nathan. David will be among the attendees at her funeral together with his wife Joyce, clearly being in mourning about Chloe's death. Kate as one of the attendees will stop at them and comfort them. Revealed in the second game, David and Joyce eventually divorce.

## Alternative Timeline 
David is seen as the Blackwell bus driver in the [Alternative Timeline](alternative_timeline.md). It is evident that he is no longer involved in any security for the school. He also seems to have no relationship with Max; treating her as a regular student looking to board the bus. It is clear he has not been involved with Joyce, considering William is alive and well. If Max mentions David to Joyce, Joyce will reply that David is a regular at the Two Whales Diner and that he is "quiet" and "cute," but it is evident that they share no relationship beyond that.

## Associated Deaths 
* [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md) (**Contributed, Determinant**) - He is seen bullying Kate by Max. He has also been taking pictures of the girl and following her around the Blackwell campus. By leaving the Dormitory roof door unlocked, he is partially responsible for Kate being able to climb onto the roof to attempt suicide.
* [Mark Jefferson](mark_jefferson.md) (**Direct, Determinant**) - If Max reveals to David that Chloe was killed by Jefferson, he will shoot him as an act of revenge.

## Relationships

## Friends 
* [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) (**Determinant**) - Despite being suspicious of Max during their first meeting and calling her the one who "likes to pop up and start trouble", David does apologize for his earlier actions in Episode 2 and also states he doesn't want to fight with Max or anyone else again. He also doesn't bust Max for smoking weed. He will obviously be on good terms with Max if she chooses to side with him during the living room argument. He thanks her numerous times for defending him and at the end of the game no longer uses his service as an excuse for his behavior. David also remarks that he is impressed by Max and Chloe's investigation, who managed to track Jefferson without the high-tech equipment. That comment, however, was likely just to make her feel better, as he already admits how close he was to know the truth in the nights before. He knew about Nathan's and Jefferson's car and registration and was close to cross-referencing those coordinates on the map, consequently linking Jefferson with Nathan, along with the [Prescott Barn](barn.md), before she ever decided to intervene. Meanwhile, Max and Chloe became victims of Jefferson in the timelines.
* [Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md) (**Questionable**) - Nathan is the only one who's not a suspect to David at the beginning of the game, but his photos are among David's secret files and at the end, David says he always knew Nathan was a threat and admits he should have neutralized him earlier.
