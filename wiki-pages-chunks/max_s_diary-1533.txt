Here is a section of the wiki page for Max's Diary:

for how she was treated. I am glad that so many people wanted to honor her. The cynical side of me says, "Too little, way too fucking late." But I know that Kate would smile and forgive us all. Sigh. Cry.*

*Day-um, that was too close. I was doing so well until I got outside and of course, it was Principal Wells of all people blocking the way. The one person I least wanted to see. I wasn't ninja enough for him so yeah, he busted me. But, I finally got to see that the gossip was true for a change. *

*Principal Wells was shitfaced. He didn't even try to hide it. In fact, he was lot cooler drunk than sober. I can see why he's so confused, dealing with Kate's family, and the Prescotts, and David Madsen. He still acts suspicious and gives me way too much "tude" as he would say (nobody says that seriously!), but I can see that he's under a lot of pressure. So much that he's so wasted he can't even use his keys at midnight. *

*Sure he was in my way, but he was no match for my rewind power. After all, I had to go and meet Chloe... Bad Max.*

*Even though I thought I was in "full ninja mode", Chloe still scared the shit out of me, which pissed me off considering what I've been going through. Sometimes she's so damn insensitive to other people's feelings.*

*She wants all my attention for her and finding Rachel and she gets all butthurt if I don't have time for her. Obviously I have time in hand. But I can't stay mad at her for long and she was so damn excited about having the keys to the main building. And honestly? I was pretty amped up too.*

*Even more so when we went to the front of the building and spied on Victoria talking smack about me (shocked!) and worse, actually trying to blackmail Mr. Jefferson to pick her photo for the "Everyday Heroes" contest. She is freaking unreal...*

*I give Mr. Jefferson major respect for telling her to get lost, even though she deserved to be expelled for pulling that crap. This is her priority after what happened with Kate? I just don't understand Victoria, no matter how I try. She's already rich, pretty, and a good photographer. Why try so hard and hurt so many to manipulate everything already in your favor?*

*I just hope that's not what I'm doing with my rewind power...*

*Yes, there's something incredibly AWESOME about breaking into your own school at the witching hour. Although Chloe was technically right: how can we break in with a key? Never mind that it was a stolen key from the school's head of security...*

*Anyway. The Blackwell Ninjas strike again!*

*So cool to stalk the halls when it's dark and quiet. Even with so many terrible things happening all around us, it felt like Chloe and I were walking towards the center of a great cosmic mystery, something bigger than any of us...*

*But we kinda suck as master spies since we didn't have a key for the Principal's office. No worries with my rewind power at hand. And of course Doctor Warren Graham. He came through with a bitchin' mini-bomb made of sodium whatthefuckever. I probably learned more putting those ingredients together than the entire semester so far. Sorry, Ms. Grant, Warren is the star student here. He tries so hard to help... maybe too much, but what's wrong with that these days? I'm so grateful he's on my team.*

*Talk about being in the sancto sanctorum (thanks Latin class I barely passed!) of Blackwell... I did feel freaking weird about being in the Principal's office after midnight, going through his files and laptop with Chloe. She was waaaay too into it. Technically, we could be arrested and thrown in jail. Yikes. I just pretended that we were on a very special episode of "The Wizards of Waverly Place,"*-* you know, just a couple of "wacky Sherlocks" investigating the school for a good cause... Yeah, that helped.*

*While we didn't find The Proof, we found Nathan's file had a weird drawing in it that just said, "Rachel in the dark room" over and over. So that's a major clue that Nathan is involved in this somehow. Or he's just insane. But his note also referenced "David M." which means that we absolutely have to find a way into David's secret bunker files. For a good cause.''

I stopped her, but it kind of bothers me that Chloe can be so selfish like that. I'm not going to let anything happen to her, but I can't just let her do anything she wants... "Mad Max"?

I'll find a way to make it up to the fund... after all, saving a life is priority. As is my habit with Chloe. No matter what, our fates seem bound together, for better or worse.

Usually worse.*
