**Max:** Victoria is not nice. I don't get it. She has everything. And to pull that prank on a friend.

**Dana:** Just because they're in the Vortex Club doesn't mean they're BFF's. I'm in it and Victoria creeps me out. Max, you're smart to be a loner here. Though Warren obviously likes hanging with you...

**Max:** Dana, I'm not trying to be nosy, but I heard a rumor about you.

**Dana:** What? Who told you I was pregnant?

**Max:** Nobody important. They just acted like it was bullshit. I just wanted you to know...

**Dana:** Uh, Max? That's mine, thank you! You're not helpful, you're just nosy. I think you better go...

**Max:** *(thinking)* Nice, Max. You hurt her feelings by being so damn nosy again. But I could rewind and make it up to her...

**Max:** *(thinking)* Must protect my precious, so Max never has to chase it down again.

*Max exits the girls' dormitories.*
