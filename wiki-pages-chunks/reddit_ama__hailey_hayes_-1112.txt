## Question 18 

**ashisnotspooky**

i'm asking questions as they pop in my head

how is it knowing all these technically famous people that you've worked with on LiS or even are just regular friends with? i mean, i know that i know you but i'm curious. do you ever get anxious about what they think of you or maybe even starstruck?

**haileyhayes**

Oh definitely, especially like my first times meeting Daye and Hannah, but they're just such kind warm inviting people that I'm comfortable around them now and I don't get nervous talking to them anymore.

## Question 19 

**GO-ON-A-STEAM-TRAIN**

Hi! :) Thank you for stopping by and answering questions! :)

I was just wondering what recording with the other cast felt like? It must have been surreal getting to be a part of a series you'd played before getting casted! :)

The other thing I was curious about is if you're still in touch with anyone from the voice or game side of things? Would you like to work with anyone in particular again? :)

Thank you again for doing this, Samantha was one of my favourite characters in Before the Storm! :)

**haileyhayes**

Hello! Thank you for stopping by and asking some great questions!

So I actually recorded alone. However, getting to meet up and talk with other members of the original cast such as Daye and Hannah definitely felt surreal and mind blowing because here are two people who brought to life two amazing on screen presences I thought I'd never talk to in my life and now they're inviting me to stream with them and eat waffles together. It's really cool and I wish there was a more eloquent word I could use to sum it up, but I feel like "cool" says it all.
I am definitely still in touch with most of the VAs from both games and Phil, our voice director. Honestly, I'd love to work with any of the VAs on another project again and Phil is my favorite director I've worked with so I definitely would love to work on another project with him.
Ah thank you so much! I'm so glad you enjoyed her and the game!

**GO-ON-A-STEAM-TRAIN**

Thank you so much for your answer! I didn't realise it was a solo mission to perform dialogue! :) I can totally see why the developers would much prefer that, but from how the talking went back and forth I can't believe you weren't in the same room! :) That just made your scene outside Blackwell even more impressive! :)

That's so nice!! :) I'm really happy that you had a blast recording it, and it wasn't a one and done deal. :) I need to have a look into twitch a bit more, it sounds like a bunch of awesome people who worked on the series are on there! :D

Fingers crossed that next project with Phil is in this world, but I really can't wait to see what's next, best of luck, and thank you so much for answering, you've made my day! üòÅ

**haileyhayes**

Thank you so much for participating in the AMA! Have a beautiful day!
