Here is a section of the wiki page for Young Max and Chloe:

## Max # 
When it comes to helping Chloe throw away old items, Max's sensibility and detachment suggests she has less of an emotional response to things than Chloe, but this is not entirely the case as she is very reflective and sad to be leaving Chloe behind in [Arcadia Bay](arcadia_bay.md). She even worries she won't be okay without Chloe.In her diary from the first game, Max describes Arcadia bay as "a town I was excited about leaving."

Max is prone to second-guess and worry about the consequences of things before she can loosen up and enjoy herself (such as asking Chloe what her mom would think about Chloe's mischief) and has a reserved personality and quiet-spoken nature. See the [#Family_Differences](family_differences.md) section above, as the differences between their parents may have an influence on each girl.
She can also tell Chloe that she worries she's not going to be okay without her, regarding her move to Seattle.

Max is drawn to the retro aesthetic. She especially loves the {{wiki|Instant_camera#Polaroid_cameras|Polaroid camera}} that belongs to Chloe's father, because she thinks they make every photo look a little nostalgic. Chloe tells Max that [William Price](her_dad.md) is tired of watching Max drool all over herself every time he uses it. ("His words.") Max also admires the vintage cooler in Chloe's attic, saying that she never realized how much she liked vintage things until she saw it. She thinks that recording messages on audio cassette tapes was so much fun in 3rd grade (ages 8/9).

Some further facts we learn about Max are as follows:
* At age 13, she is still terrified of Chloe's attic as she is afraid of the mice and spiders that could be up there.
* Chloe's mom bought her a toothbrush, because she spent the night at Chloe's so often.
* She doesn't get the idea of makeup other than using it for acting or Halloween costumes.
* She gets squeamish at the sight of fake blood which may suggest she gets squeamish when she sees the real thing.
