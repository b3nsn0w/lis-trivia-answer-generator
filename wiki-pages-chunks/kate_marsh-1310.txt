Here is a section of the wiki page for Kate Marsh:

## Episode Four - "[Episode 4: Dark Room](dark_room.md)" 
Provided that Kate survives the events of Episode 2, Max and Chloe will visit her in the hospital before going to the Prescott Dormitory to look for Nathan. Max, who is extremely happy to see her, will talk with her, noting that she seems happier since she attempted suicide. Kate regrets her suicide attempt deeply and feels very ridiculous, but Max assures her that other people need to feel responsible for what has happened. She is also very grateful towards Max for coming up to the rooftop to talk to her because she was feeling lost and alone all the time, but Max's caring and trying showed her that she wasn't. Actually, she understood that there are a lot of people who love her.

Kate tells Max that she has to stay at the hospital for another day until her family comes to visit. Her family is now very protective towards Kate, and feel very guilty.

People seem to have felt truly sorry for her, sending postcards, letters, balloons, flowers and cards to her. She comments that she gave most of the flowers away to other patients, believing they need them more than her. She seems surprised that so many people from Blackwell wrote to her, including [Daniel DaCosta](daniel_dacosta.md), Mr. Jefferson and even Victoria who wrote her a very sweet note. Max notes that Nathan's name is not on the card from the Blackwell students. Taylor had sent her pretty tulips.
[File:Kate's Drawings.jpg](thumb.md)
A nurse provided Kate with pencils and paper, and Kate started drawing children's illustrations again; planning on creating a new book about bullying. She asks Max to take photos of the book for her. The drawings seem to make her more hopeful for the future. She and Max even talk about having a tea-shop tour of [Portland](portland.md). Kate suggests she also bring Warren along. Max can disagree, banning boys from the trip, or question Warren's involvement.

[Raymond Wells](principal_wells.md) sent her an email wishing her a speedy recovery. He talks about a rally in her honor, and tries to offer her help.

After seeing a postcard by Victoria sent offering her help, Max can talk to Kate about Victoria's personality, speculating about either her insecurities or how bitchy she is. Kate decides to forgive her, because she believes in forgiveness and redemption.

If Max chooses to talk to Kate about Nathan, Kate states that he should pay for what he did to her and that they have to stop him from hurting anybody else. She will text Max his room number (111) when she visits the boy's dorms later in the episode.

On the End of the World Vortex Club Party, Victoria dedicates her [Everyday Heroes Photo Contest](everyday_hero_contest.md) prize to Kate.

## Episode Five - "[Episode 5: Polarized](polarized.md)" 
Whilst in the [Dark Room (Location)](dark_room.md), Max uses her selfie taken at the beginning of the first episode and travels back to Jefferson's class where everything started. Max may comfort Kate after the class telling her she'll always be there for her and also confront Victoria with her video of Kate. Kate will later be deeply thankful, as evident from her [Max's_Messages#Kate_3](messages.md), although it does not have any effect on the rest of the episode, as Max later travels back in time again.

Kate later appears in [Max's Nightmare](max_s_nightmare.md).

Kate Survived# Kate Survived
If Max saved Kate, in the art class scene of Max's nightmare, Kate's place in Jefferson's classroom will be filled with scribbles of "I WANT TO DIE". In the Girls' Dormitory scene, Kate is seen sitting in front of her dormitory room and mourning at her memorial. When Max talks to her, Kate blames Max for making sure that Kate would never be alone again by saving her life. She will then jump off the roof like she did in Episode 2. In the diner scene, Kate asks Max not to let her die.

If Kate succeeded in committing suicide, in the art class scene of Max's nightmare, Kate's place in Jefferson's classroom will be splattered with blood. In the Girls' Dormitory scene, Kate is seen sitting in front of her dormitory room and mourning at her memorial. When Max talks to her, Kate blames her for letting her die and claims that she is stuck in hell forever now. She will then jump off the roof like she did in Episode 2. In the diner scene, Kate asks Max not to kill her so that they can "have [their] tea session."

Kate's survival and last appearance depend on Max's decision at the end of Episode 5.

Sacrifice Chloe# Sacrifice ChloeIf Chloe is sacrificed in the end of the game by returning to the bathroom at the beginning of the week and letting her die at the hand of Nathan, Nathan gets arrested and denounces Mark Jefferson to the police. Kate doesn't go to the roof anymore since the police found evidence in the Dark Room that she was abducted. It will be hard for her but people believe her and it will be easier for her to overcome this, especially with Max at her side.
	
In the closing scene, Kate can be seen walking along with Principal Wells and other attendees before stopping beside David and [Joyce Price](joyce_price.md) to comfort them during Chloe's funeral.
|-|Sacrifice Arcadia BaySacrifice Arcadia Bay
If Max prevented Kate's suicide she has a good chance of surviving the [storm](storm.md), as she planned to leave the town after her hospitalization with her parents on Friday morning, but it's not clear if she or her parents managed to leave in time. *Life Is Strange 2: Episode 5: Wolves* revealed that she died in the storm as David says he and Chloe lost "everyone", which presumably includes Kate.
