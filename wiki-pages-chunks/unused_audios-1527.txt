and Joyce got into an argument... I could rewind and not answer Kate. It's not like I won't see her in class later." {{Headphones|file# Ep2-Diner-KateChoicePhone-voiceover-01.ogg}}
*Max if she ignored Kate's call in the diner: "I hope Kate won't have a meltdown because I didn't answer... She knows I'll see her in class later."The line is spoken differently to how it is actually written: "I hope Kate doesn't have a meltdown if I don't answer... She knows I'll see her in class later." This line would have been spoken before answering the call and may have been seen as influencing the player's decision too much. {{Headphones|fileEp2-Diner-Max-voiceover-02.ogg}} . . . "I hope Kate doesn't get upset I didn't answer... but I could rewind and answer her..." {{Headphones|file# Ep2-Diner-KateChoicePhone-voiceover-02.ogg}}
*Max in the [junkyard](junkyard.md), looking at some graffiti: "Can't see the name of who Frank loves..." {{Headphones|fileEp2-Junkyard-Graffiti03-look.ogg}} . . . "A popular meme these days..." {{Headphones|file# Ep2-Junkyard-Graffiti04-look.ogg}} . . . "Irony or metaphor?" {{Headphones|fileEp2-Junkyard-Graffiti06-look.ogg}}
*Max in the junkyard when she finds a message in a bottle: "Oh my gawd... I've actually found a message in a bottle!" {{Headphones|file# Ep2-Junkyard-MessageInBottle-look-01.ogg}} . . . "Why yes, I could just accidently *[sic]* smash it open and take a peek..." {{Headphones|fileEp2-Junkyard-MessageInBottle-look-02.ogg}} . . . "Boom! Release the message! But I can't bring broken glass to Chloe. I can always rewind to unbreak the bottle..." {{Headphones|file# Ep2-Junkyard-MessageInBottle-look-03.ogg}} . . . "Snap! Everything back the way it was. Rachel wanted this message to be secret, and so it shall remain a secret..."Before this last line, the following line was intended to be spoken: "Now what's up with this weird secret relationship? Sounds like Rachel was confused about it, maybe even ashamed... I wish she named names. I better not show this to Chloe or she will be seriously hurt." In the game, this line is instead heard when Max finds the "paper ball" (Rachel's secret letter) in the trash can inside the [hideout](hideout.md). {{Headphones|fileEp2-Junkyard-MessageInBottle-look-05.ogg}}
*Max in the junkyard with Chloe, when Chloe fails at hitting bottles: "Just shoot, it's all good." {{Headphones|file# Ep2-Junkyard-Bottle01Fail.ogg}} - "Max?" {{Headphones|fileEp2-Junkyard-Bottle02Fail.ogg}} . . . "Yes, I'm getting bored, Max." {{Headphones|file# Ep2-Junkyard-Bottle03Fail.ogg}} . . . "How about another target, Max?" {{Headphones|fileEp2-Junkyard-Bottle04Fail-01.ogg}} . . . "Like today." {{Headphones|file# Ep2-Junkyard-Bottle04Fail-02.ogg}} . . . "What a waste of a bullet." {{Headphones|fileEp2-Junkyard-Bottle04Fail-03.ogg}} . . . "Max, the bottles are mocking us." {{Headphones|file# Ep2-Junkyard-Bottle04Fail-04.ogg}}
*Chloe in the junkyard, during the bottle shooting test: (If the test is a failure, she urges Max to repeat it again) "One for the road—" {{Headphones|fileEp2-Junkyard-GunFail.ogg}} . . . (When the test is successful and Max passes out from a nosebleed) "Max!" {{Headphones|file# Ep2-Junkyard-GunSuccess-01.ogg}} . . . "Max, here let me help you find a place to chill..." {{Headphones|fileEp2-Junkyard-GunSuccess-02.ogg}}
*Frank in the junkyard after Max shot at him: "You're Dumb and Dumber." {{Headphones|file# Ep2-Junkyard-ShootFrank-Frank-01.ogg}} . . . (To Chloe) "You still have a tab with me. Don't ever pull crap like this again—it will be the last time you do." {{Headphones|fileEp2-Junkyard-ShootFrank-Frank-02.ogg}}
*Max in the junkyard after shooting at Frank: "Jesus, I almost shot this guy. Now he's even more dangerous to Chloe and me... I should rewind and try something else..."The suggestion to rewind has been removed from the line we now have in the game. Possibly removed for being too influencing on the player to choose the other option. {{Headphones|file# Ep2-Junkyard-ShootFrank-voiceover.ogg}}
*Max to Chloe in the junkyard after shooting at Frank: "It's okay. I need to walk. I'm still jacked up after all that..." {{Headphones|fileEp2-Junkyard-Shoot-Max.ogg}}
*Chloe in the junkyard, speaking to Frank (line originally intended to be spoken after Frank says, "Oh Christ. You're more like Abbot and Costello."): "Who?" {{Headphones|file# Ep2-Junkyard-DropTheGun-Chloe.ogg}}
*Max in the junkyard after losing possession of David's gun to Frank: "Damn, that was intense, Chloe. Too much. I need to walk off all that drama... and you can tell me about what's been going on in Arcadia Bay since we were kids." {{Headphones|fileEp2-Junkyard-DropTheGun-Max.ogg}}
*Max looking at a Blackwell corridor poster of [Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md): "These "Missing Person" posters are so sad." {{Headphones|file#
