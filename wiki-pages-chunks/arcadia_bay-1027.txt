**Arcadia Bay** is a fictional, picturesque seaside town in Oregon, United States, and the setting of the original *[Life is Strange](life_is_strange.md)*. It reappears in the [Life is Strange: Before the Storm](prequel_game.md) and very briefly in *[Life is Strange 2](life_is_strange_2.md)*.

Arcadia Bay was originally inhabited and founded by [Native American](native_american.md)s, as mentioned by [Michelle Grant](ms__grant.md) when she speaks of the settlers living peacefully with one another after their arrival. Its main source of commerce was fishing which - according to a [R.J. MacReady](fisherman.md) - is no longer feasible due to the [Prescott Family](prescott_family.md)'s business practices.

## Life is Strange 
In *Life is Strange*, which is set in October 2013, the town is experiencing [Meteorological Anomalies](strange_weather_and_other_phenomena.md) that is somehow linked to [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md)'s [Rewind](time_controlling_abilities.md).

A freak snow flurry and an unexpected eclipse end [Episode 1: Chrysalis](episode_1.md) and [Episode 2: Out of Time](episode_2.md), respectively. The reoccurring deaths of animals are seen throughout [Episode 3: Chaos Theory](episode_3.md), and an ominous double moon appears at the end of [Episode 4: Dark Room](episode_4.md). In [Episode 5: Polarized](episode_5.md), Arcadia Bay's fate is in the player's hands as the town can be destroyed by the [Storm](tornado.md) in Max's visions, or it can be saved by going back to the beginning of the game and allowing [Chloe Price](chloe_price.md) to get shot by [Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md).

## Before the Storm 
In *Before the Storm*, which is set in 2010, three years before the events of *Life is Strange*, a [Forest Fire](forest_fire.md) is started by [Rachel Amber (Before the Storm)](rachel_amber.md).

## Comics 
***Note: The events of the comic series, based on the original game, are not intended to be a true ending continuation, [https://twitter.com/Emmavieceli/status/1060208929622446080 as emphasized by the writer].***

The [Life is Strange (Comic Series)](comic_series.md), continues the Sacrifice Arcadia Bay ending. It shows Arcadia Bay has been destroyed. However, it is also revealed that the Prescotts and the Prescott Foundation have chosen to contribute money to the relief effort and rebuilding.
