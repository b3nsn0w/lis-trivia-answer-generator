# ## Outside the Gallery 
Outside of the gallery is viewed through the glass door near the entrance. There are cars parked along the street near the gallery and cars that pass by every couple of seconds. Across the street there are multiple storefronts and electric lines. Directly across the street from the gallery, there are graffiti or perhaps a sign for a store that reads "THiS iS WATER" with three fish in between the words "this is" and "water". Across the street there is also a parking sign. A street corner is also viewable, suggesting that the gallery is on a corner. It is a sunny day outside with minimal clouds.

## "Everyday Heroes" Wall 

"What is a hero?

The Zeitgeist Gallery is proud to be a participant in the 2013
"Everyday Heroes" national contest, a showcase for today's
future stars of photography.

The winners, chosen by prestigious teachers from art schools
and programs across the nation, reveal imaginative skill and
heartfelt awareness which highlight the casual heroism of those
who may never appear on the news (or reality shows) for unrecog-
nized deeds to the community and beyond. Celebrating each
young artist and their work is as important as their celebration of
our all too often invisible Everyday Heroes..."
