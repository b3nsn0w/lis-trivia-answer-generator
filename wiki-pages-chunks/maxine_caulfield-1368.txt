Max is geeky, quite introverted and slightly self-conscious, particularly when it comes to her photography. According to Max, she prefers to observe the world around over participating in it. Because of this, several students, including [Juliet Watson](juliet_watson.md), think she doesn't care much about others. But on the contrary, she makes a genuine effort to show kindness to all of Blackwell's students. She's a clear, deductive thinker, smart and sneaky, while also practical, reasonable and mature, in some aspects, for her age, especially compared to her best friend, Chloe. She is also brave, placing herself in harm's way to protect those she cares about.

She has great affection and interest in photography, always taking pictures of her surroundings, since she considers it a way to be part of the world at a safe distance and aspires to make it into a career one day. She especially has an affinity for old analog cameras and instant camera selfies. She also seems to like obscure cult movies and anime, much like her friend [Warren Graham](warren_graham.md). She has always dreamed of traveling and exploring the world, as well as going on "adventures" together with her childhood friend Chloe.

Max becomes more confident and decisive as her adventure continues, probably due to Chloe's influence combined with her time-altering powers. This newfound strength and self-confidence reaches its apex in [Episode 5: Polarized](episode_5.md) when she is finally confronted with Jefferson and has to save Chloe. Right from the beginning, Max feels deeply responsible for her actions and does not take her rewind power lightly, and she doesn't yet realize the full consequences of her power. In the end, Max appears deeply troubled with the consequences of her decisions and the responsibility she has to bear, as represented by [Max's Nightmare](her_nightmare.md).

Some people regard Max as "nosy" - as revealed in her [Media:Note3-office-maxfile-alive.png](blackwell_student_file.md). There are several instances throughout the game where Max is called that by other characters, including admitting to being nosy herself. It's obvious that Max is pretty interested in other people's stuff, but it's up to the player how far her curiosity goes, such as to what extent she goes to nose around in other people's rooms.

She is shown as extremely introverted, preferring to stay in her room, likes to isolate herself with music and excuse herself to go to the bathroom to have a "meltdown" after being called on in class, is reluctant to submit her photo, despite strong encouragement from her favorite teacher, and has trouble during social interactions with people, even her dorm-mates, until her powers allow her to "cheat". She also comes across as aloof to her peers (a common experience for people on the autistic spectrum or with anxiety disorders) and apparently fluctuates between being too quiet or too chatty. She is in an IEP (Individualized Education Program, a program usually reserved for students with some form of disorder which means they need help) according to her student file, but otherwise, nothing is confirmed.

She refers to herself as being clumsy after breaking and spilling a number of items and having to rewind time.

## Appearance
Max is the quintessential hipster, preferring an understated style that consists of simple T-shirts bearing logos and "generic jeans" (as Chloe calls them). She has auburn brown hair, blue eyes, and freckles. She appears to wear eye shadow and eyeliner, although this is also quite understated. She has no tattoos or piercings that we know of. She wears a set of three colored bangles on her right wrist that appear to be silicone wristbands.

## Autobiography
The following is what Max wrote about herself in [Max's Diary](her_journal_s_diary.md):

''My name is Max Caulfield, and ever since I was a little kid I knew I wanted to be a photographer. I've always seen the world through my own lens finder. Maybe it's a way for me to be part of the world, but at a safe distance.*

*For some reason I was always drawn to old analog camera gear rather than digital tech. I love all kinds of styles and techniques but for me, the instant camera selfie is the one I love most. I don't care if people make fun of me or not. I'm in great company, right? And now I've come all the way back to my childhood home to study photography at Blackwell Academy, a private school for 12th grade seniors.*

*On a scholarship even! I originally left behind [Chloe Price](chloe.md), my "best friend forever" (at least until I left without talking to her once in five years) and it feels so weird to be back here without seeing her yet. So I'm eighteen now, an official adult even though I don't always feel so wise or mature, and I'm ready to begin a whole new life here with retro camera at my side.*

*"Say Cheese!"*

*At least I'm trying to climb out of my cocoon.''That's a reference to the butterfly, which is a recurring leitmotif in *Life is Strange* and an important symbolism regarding time controlling powers.'' I shouldn't expect my life to completely change after a few weeks of Blackwell Academy. As my parents love telling me on a loop, "You have all the time in the world." ''That's a very ironic foreshadowing to the happenings in "Chrysalis" and her gaining of time controlling powers.
