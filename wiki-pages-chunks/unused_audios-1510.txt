Here is a section of the wiki page for Unused Audios:

## Episode Five - "[Episode 5: Polarized](polarized.md)" 
* Jefferson to Max regarding Nathan in the Dark Room: "Like you Max, I... am a camera. And like some cultures believe I'm going to use my camera. To capture... your... soul. Now take a break. I need to deal with Nathan first. Don't worry, our session is just... getting started."This unused audio file indicates that it was planned for Nathan to still be alive after Max finds herself in the Dark Room. It would've been possible for him to make another appearance in this episode, and it would've also been possible for Max to save him in that situation. [File:Headphones.png](16px.md)
* Kate in Jefferson's class room after Max approaches her: "I hope I'm not bothering you. As long as I have friends like you everything should be okay. Max, you gave me strength. Thank you. Thank you for being such a good friend. You're so kind and patient with me. I hope you don't think I'm being silly. It's not such a shitty day now. You have a great heart and soul." {{Headphones|fileYouGaveMeStrengthh.ogg}}
* In the plane, Max could make this inner comment: "And now I'm flying 30000 feet over the world, on the way to my first gallery show... in San Francisco. So maybe this is my own heaven."{{Headphones|file# VO_E5_3A.STM_1~Act_E5_3A_Plane_IdleLines_Scripted_Max_060.ogg‎}} (note: commercial jets tend to fly between 35000 and 42000 feet)
* In the plane, Max could make this inner comment: "Maybe I'll need counselling (sigh)... I have been through my own hell."{{Headphones|fileVO_E5_3A.STM_31~Act_E5_3A_Plane_IdleLines_Scripted_Max_050.ogg‎}}
* In the plane, Max could make this inner comment: "Get your bearings Max. You were trapped in a darkroom... then you time-warped back to Jefferson's class on Monday. Check. You sent a warning text to David and actually turned in your photo for the contest. Check. (sigh) Now what will happen?"{{Headphones|file# ‎VO_E5_3A.STM_48~Act_E5_3A_Plane_IdleLines_Scripted_Max_020.ogg}}
* In the plane, Max could make this inner comment: "I know she will be devastated about Rachel and it crushes me to thing of her and Rachel's family dealing with this nightmare. I wish I could have gone back further. But... at least the police have Nathan and Jefferson... and they'll never hurt anybody else."{{Headphones|file‎VO_E5_3A.STM_58~Act_E5_3A_Plane_IdleLines_Scripted_Max_040.ogg}}
*Max in the [Zeitgeist Gallery](san_francisco_art_gallery.md): "I love this map of the city, it's so romantic." "I could take so many epic shots from anywhere in the city." "The Zeitgeist Gallery. Starring Max Caulfield." "Anyway, this really is so cool." "*Windows* by Maxine Caulfield, 2013." "Ugh, Maxine, for reals? Sigh, eat me." {{Headphones|file# SoRomantic.ogg}}

* Max going back in time through her [Everyday Heroes Photo Contest](everyday_heroes_contest.md) photo: "Nothing will keep us apart again, Chloe... not even time." {{Headphones|fileNotEvenTime.ogg}}
* Max looking at her desk when between realities (not possible in the final game): "I can't leave warnings to myself everywhere, I'll end up changing too much... or worse" [File:Headphones.png](16px.md)"baby steps Max, do as little as possible, please"[File:Headphones.png](16px.md)
* David in the Dark Room after saving Max: "Now this is exactly why I don't trust man with goatees." {{Headphones|file# WhyDontTrustGoatees.ogg}}
* Max looking at Nathan's jacket after having been freed by David (the jacket didn't make it in the final game) "If Nathan had more help, more support *sigh* this might have gone a different way. I think about him, chilling on the grass in the other timeline... I hate what he did but... I can't hate him".{{Headphones|file16Eg.ogg‎}}
* Max looking at Mr. Jefferson's car: "Almost as good as a DeLorean" (reference to Back to the Future) [File:Headphones.png](16px.md)
