: ''For information on Max's rewind ability, see [Rewind](rewind.md).''
[File:Max's_Journey.jpg](thumb.md)]
**Timestream montages** appear whenever [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) uses her Focus ability on a photo to go back in time and alters a past events and the present event which causes the [timeline](timeline.md) to be Altered. These timestream sequences consist of moments that happened in the earlier timeline burning and merging into moments of the new timeline. The timestream images were illustrated by French concept artist [Florent Auguy](florent_auguy.md).

## Alternative/Altered Timeline 
Max travels back in time to the day [William Price](william_price.md) ([Chloe Price](chloe_price.md)'s father) dies in a car crash. She prevents him from driving his car, creating an [Alternative Timeline](alternative_timeline.md) very different from the original where William is now alive. A timestream montage shows the events of the original timeline being altered. After either accepting or refusing a serious request made by Chloe in this alternative timeline, Max returns to the day William died and lets events happen as they did in the original timeline. Another timestream montage occurs, depicting the previously shown events reverting back to the original ones.
