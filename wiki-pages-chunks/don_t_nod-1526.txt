## Notes 

, {{Wiki|Ubisoft}} and {{Wiki|Electronic Arts}} staff, DONTNOD started operating out of a small Paris-based office in May 2008. 

Their first game and AAA release was the third-person action brawler titled *Remember Me*. This game was published by {{Wiki|Capcom}} in June 2013 and is an action-adventure sci-fi game based around a member of a resistance group looking to recover her lost memories. The game was originally called *Adrift* and was planned as an exclusive title for Sony's Playstation 3 console, but it was cancelled by Sony in 2011 due to budget constraints. The team had spent almost five years developing *Remember Me*, but its critical reception was mixed and it failed to hit commercial targets. As a result, Capcom never commissioned a sequel and Dontnod found itself in trouble. In January, 2014, it was reported that the studio had filed for bankruptcy. CEO Oskar Guilbert dismissed reports that the studio was bankrupt and stated that earlier financial issues were no longer a problem for the company as they started to work on "new projects" which required judicial reorganization and new investments.[https://www.polygon.com/2014/1/31/5364452/report-remember-me-studio-dontnod-filing-for-bankruptcy Report: Remember Me studio Dontnod filing for bankruptcy] (January 31, 2014) CEO Oskar Guilbert: "After *Remember Me*, the financial situation at Dontnod was very difficult. After that, we had to restructure the company and reinvent ourselves. Before, what we wanted to do was make big games with large teams and long production cycles... So we had to change that, do something smaller with smaller teams. We didn’t want to do just a small game, we also wanted to bring something new to the market, and we did it pretty well with *Life is Strange*."[https://www.mcvuk.com/business-news/how-life-is-strange-changed-dontnod/ How Life is Strange changed Dontnod] (October 25, 2016) 

*Life is Strange* is the studio's second game and breakthrough title, published by . At the time, most prospective publishers were unwilling to publish the game unless it featured more action sequences[https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-s-life-is-strange-considered-100-diffe/1100-6425742/ Square Enix's Life is Strange Considered 100 Different Names] (March 6, 2015) or had a male protagonist due to "little sales potential"[https://www.gamespot.com/articles/other-publishers-told-us-to-make-it-a-male-lead-ch/1100-6424577/ "Other Publishers Told Us to Make It a Male Lead Character," Life is Strange Dev Says] (January 10, 2015)[https://v1.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/139401-Publishers-Disliked-Dontnods-Life-is-Strange-Having-Female-Leads Publishers Wanted Life is Strange Devs to Make Leads Male] (January 11, 2015), a problem they had already faced with their first title, *Remember Me*.[https://www.gamespot.com/articles/publishers-said-you-cant-have-a-female-character-says-remember-me-dev/1100-6405550/ Publishers said 'You can't have a female character,' says Remember Me dev] (March 19, 2013) CEO Oskar Guilbert had also challenged the idea at the start.Barnes, Ben (June 2016). "Edge #293". Edge. p. 94-97: Future plc. Square Enix, who loved the game's storytelling element, was the only publisher that supported the project with no intention to change it. Originally, Dontnod had pitched a larger game to Square Enix that the publisher was not interested in, whereupon Dontnod chose to present their smaller narrative project *What If?*[https://www.mcvuk.com/business-news/they-originally-pitched-a-different-game-how-square-enix-discovered-life-is-strange/ ‘They originally pitched a different game’: how Square Enix discovered Life Is Strange] (August 7, 2015), which would later be retitled to *Life is Strange*.The game was originally codenamed "What If" but then retitled to distinguish itself from the film of the same name. Dontnod had considered over 100 different titles, including "Chrysalis", which would later be used as the first episode's title. Before signing with Square Enix, *Life is Strange* was imagined as a full-length video game that Dontnod would self-publish. However, the publisher surmised that it would be more successful as an episodic title. The episodic format, which had become a successful phenomenon through Telltale Games' releases, was adapted due to financial reasons as a "slow risk" approach, as well as marketing and creative reasons, allowing them to tell the story in its preferred slow pace.[https://www.mcvuk.com/business-news/life-is-good-dontnod-on-the-success-of-life-is-strange-and-what-comes-next/ Life is good: Dontnod on the success of Life is Strange and what comes next] (March 15, 2015)[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/26/life-is-strange-episodic-video-game-dontnodLife Is Strange: episodic video games prove as addictive as episodic TV] (April 26, 2015) An episodic game about a young girl with rewind powers, it builds on a central mechanism from their first game, *Remember Me*, the memory remixes. Its first episode was released in January 2015; all five episodes were released by October 2015. Development on this game actually began in April 2013 with a small team of 15 people. This increased to a staff of 40 after a year when Square Enix stepped in to support production in June 2014.Citation needed.Two months after signing their publishing contract with Square Enix, *Life Is Strange* was announced for PS3, Xbox 360 and PC at Gamescom on August 11,
