## Question 20 
**PinkAbuuna** 

Hello!

# How are you today?
# If DONTNOD announced a Life is Strange Video Game Universe akin to the MCU, how would you react?
# Best moment when voicing Samantha?
# If you could tell yourself before getting the role of Sam anything, what would you say and why?
# Will you be playing The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit, what game are you currently playing, and what are you hoping to play?
# How many questions in an AMA from one person are too many?

**haileyhayes**

Hello!
#You're super sweet! I'm doing great, thanks, how are you? :)
#Omg I'd be so excited. That would be the coolest thing ever. I can't wait for Life is Strange: Infinity War
# Best moment when voicing Samantha was the "You shut the fuck up" line and also "You should be ashamed" because Phil had me flip him off in the booth while I delivered that line which was pretty cool
# Oh god, if I could tell myself anything before getting Samantha it would be 'Keep pushing forward, all your hard work's about to pay off.'
# I will definitely be playing The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit! I'm super excited for it! Currently, I'm playing South Park: The Fractured But Whole, Heavy Rain, and Inside. I have so many games I'm hoping to play, I think I'm most excited for the Batman: Arkham series, Detroit: Become Human, and the Tomb Raider series
# Oh there can never be enough. One million. That might be excessive, but even then I'd probably answer all one million of them tbh

**PinkAbuuna** 

With #2, would Hawt Dog Man be the "Thanos" of the universe? ðŸ¤”

## Question 21 

**AkashicRecorder**

Hi Hailey!

Since Life is Strange 2 has been said to feature completely new characters, what kind of settings and characters would you personally like to see in it?

**haileyhayes**

Hello!

Awesome question! Well I honestly have no idea what the new season of Life is Strange holds, but I think it would be very cool to follow the adult protagonist of Captain Spirit, even though we still don't know much about him yet!

## Question 22 
**alexmason32**

Hi Hailey! Your performance was fantastic. I seriously felt for Samantha!

My question is how much did you personally relate to Samantha? Was there anything you'd change about her character?

Also, where do you think she'd end up after the game? I'm assuming some kinda prestige college.

Also also, favorite band?

**haileyhayes**

Thank you so much!

When I was Samantha's age, I was really shy and kept to myself a lot. I feel like I try to stick up for people who are misunderstood or wrongfully misjudged. I try to see things from multiple perspectives and not just my own. I wouldn't change a thing about Samantha, I feel like the writers and devs created an exceptionally well rounded character.

Oh, I love the idea of her ending up at some kinda prestige college and I might just steal your idea as my answer, because....I love that. I feel like she'd go into some field where she could help people, maybe even become a therapist/psychologist.

I'm really bad at following bands, but my favorite artists right now are Hayley Kiyoko, Troye Sivan, and P!NK

'**alexmason32**

Thanks so much for answering! And glad you liked my answer, by all means take it!

And I can actually say I'm familiar with those bands/singers!

Oh!! I'm so sorry I almost forgot. What did you think about her relationship with Nathan? I was so concerned for her knowing what he was like. Also my friend Liz is a huge fan, if you could say "Hi Liz!" It would mean much!

**haileyhayes**

Everyone needs someone. I feel like Samantha could really be a positive influence in Nathan's life, but I guess whether or not that happens is up to the player. On the flip side, knowing what Nathan does regardless, I can see why some players prefer the choice of keeping Samantha away from Nathan.

Ah, Hi Liz!! I hope you're having a fantastic day!

'**alexmason32**

I agree! If only Samantha could have helped Nathan. I guess I just really liked the bookish type Samantha was. I mean, I can relate! So even knowing what Nathan was like I still tried to set them up!

Thank you so much for answering my questions! I really look forward to seeing you in more stuff. You're talented and I mean that with sincerity!

**haileyhayes**

Thank you so much!! I really appreciate that!

## Question 23 
**Templarkommando** 

Assuming that there would be an eventual relationship between Samantha and Nathan, what do you think that the eventual relationship between Samantha and Sean Prescott would be like?

Would you be in favor of a direct sequel to LiS: Season 1? What about a direct sequel to BtS?

What is your favorite line in all of BtS?

**haileyhayes**

I feel like at first Samantha would be very shy and quiet when it came to Sean, but after a while, she would stick up for Nathan and even defend herself if it came to that.

I feel like a direct sequel to LiS might be a little difficult, but I trust that if the devs wanted to do one, they'd do a fantastic job! For BtS, it'd be cool to follow the lives of Samantha and Steph and the other new characters from the prequel!

My favorite line in all of BtS is "Life needs a little mystery."
