Here is a section of the wiki page for Episode 4: Dark Room - Script:

## **Old Barn**
*Chloe drives her truck up a dirt path, passing a sign that reads "NO TRESPASSING." She pulls up to the barn and parks. The girls get out of the truck and approach the barn.''

**Max:** Holy shit, this is scary.

**Chloe:** I know, but we're here. Let's go find the best way in.

*Max bends down to examine tire tracks.*

**Max:** Whoa, check this out. Fresh tire tracks.

**Chloe:** Dude, somebody was just here.

**Max:** Then we need to get in that barn...

'''Chloe's comments**

**Chloe:'* Max, get over here before I torch this place!

*Max goes around to the side of the barn and moves a metal sheet, revealing another entrance.''

**Max:** Chloe! I found the front door! Come on!

**Chloe:** Oh yes! Maximus rules!

**Max:** God, this is way too Blair Witch... I have goose bumps all over.

**Chloe:** Come on, Super Max. Hey, check out this old chest!

**Max:** A little louder, Chloe! Jeez, that is ancient.

**Chloe:** Jackpot. Old shit.

**Max:** No, look closer.

**Chloe:** "Harry Aaron Prescott and family donate new library to Arcadia Bay"... "Prescott Industries celebrate grand opening"... "The Prescotts bring bomb shelter boom to town."

**Max:** Nice scrapbook. You search for more clues and I'll scope out the area.

'*Max *(thinking)*:*' ''Yes, old Prescott clippings, but that can't be the only thing here.*

*'Chloe's comments**

**Chloe: '*Boring... boring...

*Max walks to the other side of the barn and searches the ground, revealing a hatch.*

*'Max *(thinking)*:'* *Whoa, what is this? It's totally brand new. Why?*

*Max attaches a nearby hook to the padlock. She walks over to a platform and attempts to climb onto it.*

**Max:** Chloe, can you give me a hand?

**Chloe:** Sidekick at your service! Up, up and away, Super Max.

**Max:** I dig having minions.

*Max pulls the old motor down from the platform above her, steps onto it, and climbs to the next platform. She then rewinds until the motor is back in place, then attaches a nearby rope to it. She pulls the motor, which comes crashing down, pulling up the padlock.*

*'Max *(thinking)*:'* *MaxGyver strikes again!*

*Max jumps back down to the ground floor and walks back over to the hatch.*

**Max:** Damn, this is heavy...

*Max and Chloe open the hatch to reveal a staircase.*

**Chloe:** What... is this?

**Max:** Jackpot. Do I even need to say how weird this is?

**Chloe:** You just did. Who builds this kind of place?

**Max:** A Prescott, of course.

*'Max *(thinking)*:'* *This bunker is so surreal.*

*Max enters the grayed-out numbers, 542, into the keypad.*

**Max:** Oh yes! I thought that only worked in the movies! Open sesame.

**Chloe:** Stocked and ready for the apocalypse. This must have cost a fortune. Come on.

*'Max *(thinking)*:'* *Now what the hell is this...*

*'Chloe's comments**

**Chloe: **Everything is sketchy as fuck, but nothing about Rachel here.

**Chloe: '*Can you imagine chilling in this room?

*Max opens the cupboard to reveal rows of red binders. She takes out the binders labeled "Rachel," "Kate," and "Victoria" and puts them on the desk.''

**Chloe:** Come on, let's see what this shit is all about.

**Max:** We are. Okay, a binder marked "Victoria," but it's empty...

**Chloe:** Look, the next one says "Kate."

**Max:** Oh no, Kate... No...

**Chloe:** God, I should have killed that bastard back there.

**Max:** Kate wasn't the first... All those binders are filled with other victims. Victoria has to be next. Nathan must be planning to dose her tonight at the Vortex Club party.

**Chloe:** Rachel... This can't be real... These are all--these are all posed shots, right? Right?

**Max:** Chloe. Look at her face. She's... out of it.

**Chloe:** Maybe--maybe Nathan paid her a shitload of cash to do this. She probably would have.

**Max:** I don't think so. Why is he putting her in the ground like that? Where--

**Chloe:** The junkyard! Max, we have to find that spot, now! Then we can see what he did... There's no way she's dead. No way! She posed for those pictures, Max. I know it, please... let's go.

'*Max *(thinking)*:*' *Oh my God... Rachel... Kate... all these files...*
