This leads to Principal Wells deciding to suspend Jefferson from representing Blackwell at the [Everyday Heroes Photo Contest](everyday_heroes_photo_contest.md) due to the potential negative publicity from Kate's suicide attempt. Jefferson will try to shift the blame on Nathan or David in his defense depending on whether Max tried to tell on Nathan or David to Mr. Jefferson outside his class earlier.

**[Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) tries to convince [Chloe Price](chloe_price.md) that she can [Rewind](rewind_time.md) but starts to suspect that her power may not last forever. Meanwhile, [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md) tries to deal with the public shame over a viral video that was leaked and shared around the students of [Blackwell Academy](blackwell.md).**

Max wakes up in her [Prescott Dormitory](dorm.md), completely exhausted after staying awake most of the night to research the source of her [Rewind](rewind_power.md). She looks in the mirror and remarks: *"Whoa, hello zombie-face. This is what happens when you research quantum physics all night..."*. After getting shower supplies, she exits her room and overhears [Victoria Chase](victoria_chase.md) and [Taylor Christensen](taylor_christensen.md) talking. On her way to the bathroom, she sees [Alyssa Anderson](alyssa.md) get hit by toilet paper and can rewind and warn her. As she enters the dorm shower room, she sees Kate who is brushing her teeth. Kate's greeting will be kind or accusing, depending on whether Max intervened or took a photo when Kate was accosted by [David Madsen](david_madsen.md) the day before. Kate will ask if Max can bring a book back to her that she had borrowed as she needs it for class.

As Max takes a shower, she hears voices and peeks around the shower curtain to see Victoria and Taylor teasing Kate about the viral video of her allegedly setting a "tongue record" on video. Kate is clearly distressed and leaves the bathroom upset. Victoria continues to talk about Kate and says to Taylor, *"I know Nathan hooked her up. And you know he has the good shit,"* referring to [Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md). The conversation then turns to Max. Taylor says that Max is a weirdo with her dumb camera and Victoria remarks that she hates Max's "'I'm so quirky' crap." Before they both leave the bathroom, Victoria uses lipstick to leave a link to Kate's video on a bathroom mirror. Max has the option to wipe away the link before leaving the bathroom to head back to her dorm and retrieve Kate's book. If Max told on Nathan or made fun of Victoria in the [Episode 1: Chrysalis - Summary](previous_episode.md), she will find her [Max's Room](room.md) trashed by either Nathan or Victoria (with a threatening message written on the wall by Nathan or on the mirror by Victoria); however, if Max didn't do any of this, they won't vandalize her room. After finding the book, she spills juice over it and must rewind and move the juice out of the way before getting the book.

When Max visits Kate to return the book, she finds her in a depressed state, and her room is in a state of untidiness, which Max knows is completely unlike Kate. They have a conversation about the video, and Kate will be adamant that all she remembers is feeling "sick and dizzy" after just one sip of wine, Nathan offering to take her to the hospital, waking up in a room that she thought looked like a hospital, and then waking up again outside her dorm room the next day. She asks Max for her advice on what to do next.

After advising Kate, Max leaves the dorm and, after optionally speaking with [Juliet Watson](juliet_watson.md), [Dana Ward](dana_ward.md), [Brooke Scott](brooke_scott.md), and Taylor, she runs into [Warren
