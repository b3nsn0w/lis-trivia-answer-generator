Here is a section of the wiki page for Chloe Price:

## Episode Five - "[Episode 5: Polarized](polarized.md)" 
Max wakes up tied to a chair in the Dark Room. By cunning manipulation of a conversation with her captor, Mr. Jefferson, she is able to focus on a selfie that she had taken in his classroom earlier that week. She initially prevents Chloe's death in the junkyard at the hands of Jefferson by jumping back in time through the selfie and informing David of Jefferson's deeds, creating a new timeline where Jefferson was arrested on the Tuesday with Chloe still alive and Max as the winner of the [Everyday Heroes Photo Contest](photo_contest.md) as well as a journey by [plane](plane.md) to [San Francisco](san_francisco.md).

Through Max's text messages that she reads on the flight, we get to know that Max was there for Chloe after finding out about Rachel's death on Tuesday. Everything that happened during the following days in the original timeline probably never did. After David helped in the arrest of Rachel's murderer, Mr. Jefferson, he apologized to Chloe. Chloe realized David's efforts and that he truly cares for their family and came to good terms with him, calling him "step-hero." She also seemed to have put behind all the burdens that pulled her down over the years; she appears livelier by using emoji and has hope for the future again, as she has filled in paperwork to enroll in [Bay City College](bay_city_college.md), which Max seems proud of her for. After finding out about Max's win on Wednesday, Chloe is very proud and happy for Max and had helped her to pack for the trip to San Francisco. Aside from finding out about Rachel's death, everything seems optimal for Chloe. However, in this timeline, the tornado still comes to Arcadia Bay, which we learn from Chloe's panicked phone call to Max while Max is in the [Zeitgeist Gallery](zeitgeist_gallery.md) where her winning photo is on display.

Max returns back to her captivity in the Dark Room of the original timeline where Chloe was already dead at that point. Max escapes from the Dark Room with the help of David, who had found the location thanks to the clues they had left on their investigation board in Chloe's room. Before leaving the Dark Room, Max has a conversation with David, at the end of which he asks where Chloe is. Max can tell him the truth or hide it.

Tell David the truthTell David the truthUpon hearing the bad news, David looks visibly distraught that he didn't manage to save Chloe in time, and never told her he loved her. Afterwards, he will kill Jefferson in an act of revenge and sit on the floor next to Jefferson's dead body. If Max tries to talk to David, he will ask Max to leave the Dark Room, preferring not to let Max see him in that state. 
|-|Don't tell David the truth# Don't tell David the truth If Max hides the truth about Chloe by telling him that Chloe went medicating before she ended up in the Dark Room, he is happy and reassured for the first time in his life that Chloe is a stoner. Afterwards, David goes on to investigate Jefferson's computer. If Max tries to talk to David, he will ask Max to leave the Dark Room, saying Max has probably had enough of the place. 

After leaving the Dark Room, Max will manage to reach Warren at the Two Whales diner and successfully prevent Chloe's death once again by using a selfie photograph that Warren took with Max at the End of the World Party, returning to the time when it was taken. Max warns Chloe of Jefferson's treachery and Nathan's apparent death at his hands. Moreover, Max reveals to Chloe what she had experienced in the alternative timelines where Max prevented William's death and insists that she cannot keep altering time. Max manages to convince Chloe about the threat Jefferson poses and that they must do nothing and instead go back to Chloe's house to stay safe from Jefferson, so instead of springing Jefferson's trap as they did before, Max and Chloe report the scandal to David who promptly, with the help of the police, assists in the arrest of Mark Jefferson. Max stays with Chloe at Chloe's house until the storm gets too bad. After altering the timeline, Max wakes up at the beach and finds out that Chloe took "Auto Max"'s advice to head to the beach where they would be protected from the storm. Shortly after their reunion, Max loses consciousness and falls into a disturbing [Max's Nightmare](nightmare.md) which features Chloe and the key moments they shared throughout the week.

During Max's unconsciousness, Chloe carries her up to the cliff. Upon reaching the lighthouse, safe and out of the way of the incoming tornado, Max finally laments to Chloe that she was the cause of the town's destruction, whereas Chloe - admitting her selfishness after how much Max went through in preventing her from dying over and over again - is ready to accept death as her fate. Chloe bravely hands Max the photograph of the [Blue Butterfly](blue_butterfly.md) that Max had taken in the Blackwell bathroom at the start of the week and gives Max the option to go back in time to when Nathan had killed her so that Max can undo every change that was made to the timeline. The other option is for Max to stop changing history and remain in the present timeline where Chloe is still alive. Whichever decision Max makes, Chloe completely accepts that Max will have made the right choice.

Sacrifice Chloe Sacrifice Chloe  Max will kiss or hug Chloe before she rewinds for the final time, depending on whether she kissed Chloe earlier and took Chloe's side at least two times in previous episodes. After their final farewells, Max uses the photograph of the blue butterfly to return to the point when Nathan Prescott shot and killed Chloe in the bathroom in Blackwell, only this time Max does not intervene. [Timestream](timestream_montages.md) show that Mark Jefferson and Nathan were eventually arrested and questioned for their role in the deaths of Chloe and Rachel Amber. A few days later, the town is completely restored to normal without the ominous signs of dead animals and strange weather. Max attends Chloe's funeral at the [Arcadia Bay Cemetery](cemetery.md) close to the lighthouse, with David, Joyce, Principal Wells, Frank, Pompidou, Warren, Kate, Justin, Trevor, Victoria, and Dana among the attendees. During the ceremony, a blue butterfly will land on top of Chloe's coffin before flying away.

|-|Sacrifice Arcadia Bay # Sacrifice Arcadia Bay  Max takes the photograph and rips it in half, deciding that she could not stand to lose Chloe yet again and giving her another shot in life. The storm subsides and Arcadia Bay is in ruins when the two return to the town in Chloe's truck. The two are last seen leaving Arcadia Bay and driving off into the distance.
