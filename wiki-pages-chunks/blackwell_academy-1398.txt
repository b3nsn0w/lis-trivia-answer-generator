Here is a section of the wiki page for Blackwell Academy:

## Trivia 
*Blackwell Academy was originally, in an early stage of conceptualization back in January 2013, meant to be called "Avendell Highschool", as evident from a [Media:Blackwell Academy Concept Art by Gary Jamroz Palma.jpg](concept_art.md) by [Gary Jamroz-Palma](gary_jamroz_palma.md).
*The academy's architecture is based on schools in Oregon around 1910, the year Blackwell Academy was founded, aiming for a design true to reality. Main concept artist [Edouard Caplain](edouard_caplain.md) conducted research on what schools looked like at that time, their architecture, the materials that were used to build them as well as what kinds of trees populated their campus.[http://www.momenta.online/2016/02/edouard-caplain-on-the-art-behind-life-is-strange/ Edouard Caplain on the Art Behind Life Is Strange] (February 9, 2016)
*Game Designer [Alejandro Arque](alejandro_arque.md) stated in a [Blackwell Podcast](blackwell_podcast.md) [https://youtu.be/7_1PUySC38I?t27m23s interview] that the creative team at [Don't Nod](dontnod.md) looked into a lot of Oregon high schools to provide references for the creation of Blackwell Academy. They also looked into private schools and colleges for references of a more closed educational environment that does not contain many people.
* Blackwell students are provided with a student email extension of *@BlackwellAcademy.ed*.
* [Blackwell Campus](blackwell_campus.md) appears briefly in the alternative Chloe's timeline, when Max first arrives to the timeline and discovers she is a member of the [Vortex Club](vortex_club.md).
*A flyer that can be found in the Two Whales Diner states that Blackwell offers free campus tours every third Saturday.
*{{Wiki|Eye_of_Providence|The Eye of Providence}} appears around the school.
*In the main campus, near the corner of the pool building, there are a lot of joint and cigarette butts. On the wall nearby, there is a graffiti of a shark devouring an otter. This may have been drawn by Chloe to express her anger at the fact that Max was in Blackwell for over a month and made no attempt to contact her. Chloe later refers to Max as an otter in the pool while mimicking the "Jaws" theme song.
*In the [Blackwell Parking Lot](parking_lot.md), there are [References (Life is Strange)](references.md) to several different television shows on the license plates: "PRKSNRC" for *[w:c:parksandrecreation](parks_and_recreation.md)*; "THWR" for *[w:c:thewire](the_wire.md)*; "TPFTHLK" for *[w:c:topofthelake](top_of_the_lake.md)* on Jefferson's car; "CRNVL" for *[w:c:carnivale](carniv_le.md)*; "BFFVMPRSLR" for *[w:c:buffy](buffy_the_vampire_slayer.md)*; "THXFLS" for *[w:c:x-files](the_x_files.md)* on Warren's car; "TWLGHTZN" for *[w:c:twilightzone](the_twilight_zone.md)*; "THSPRNS" for *[w:c:sopranos](the_sopranos.md)*; "BRKBD" for *[w:c:breakingbad](breaking_bad.md)* on Frank's car; "BRDCHRCH" for *[w:c:broadchurch](broadchurch.md)*; "TWNPKS" for *[w:c:twinpeaks](twin_peaks.md)* on [Chloe's Truck](chloe_s_truck.md); "QNTMLP" for *[w:c:quantumleap](quantum_leap.md)*; "THPRCTC" for *[w:c:thewire:The Practice](the_practice.md)*; and "SXFTNDR" for *[w:c:sixfeetunder](six_feet_under.md)* on Nathan's car.
*Without Blackwell's eventual shift to a specialized two-year extended senior program between the events of *Before the Storm* and *Life is Strange: Season 1*, certain familiar characters such as Victoria Chase and Rachel Amber would not have been students in the academic years of 2012/2013 and 2013/2014.
* If Max fails to save Kate in Episode 2, the school flags outside Blackwell Academy remain at full-staff. There is no law that requires a school to seek a local major or Governor of State's permission to half-staff school flags upon the death of a student. It is up to the discretion of the school with regards to whether they want to do this as a mark of respect.For more information see [http://theweek.com/articles/469282/why-are-flags-flown-halfstaff-times-mourning this website].  
* Principal Wells is aware that the students call the academy "BlackHell".A drunk Principal Wells makes the following comment near the beginning of Episode 3 "Chaos Theory" when Max is trying to sneak past him from the dorms: ''"Look at me feeling sorry for myself when Kate Marsh's family is in mourning... They'll probably sue the academy right out of Oregon... Now I understand why the students call this place "BlackHell"..."''
*[File:max-student-ID.PNG](thumb.md) Max's student ID is **B1OT21F2015**. The 2015 could be an expiry year. If this is the case, then Blackwell Academy's switch to a specialized two-year extended senior program by 2013 makes a 2015 expiry date on Max's student card make sense. If the academy operated like a normal high school, then her student number would have ended with 2014.
