Here is a section of the wiki page for Rachel Amber:

## Background 
Rachel attended Blackwell Academy and was both successful and popular with the students and faculty. With an outstanding GPA of 4.0, she was considered the quintessential representation of Blackwell by [Raymond Wells](principal_wells.md) and excelled in both her studies and numerous extracurricular activities.

Her diverse goals included a career in international law and fashion modeling, and she was very ambitious to realize her dreams.This is evident through her [Media:Rachel Amber Blackwell School Record.jpg](blackwell_academy_record.md).

In 2010, she got to know Chloe Price, as they were both Blackwell students, and soon they became very close friends. Rachel helped Chloe through her hard time after facing her father's death and her mother's new marriage. The two often got into varying degrees of mischief and spent most of their time in their secret [hideout](hideout.md), a den in the [American Rust Junkyard](american_rust_junkyard.md). They even planned to leave Arcadia Bay together to head for [Los Angeles](los_angeles.md), California.

Rachel was connected with Arcadia Bay's drug scene and developed a relationship with drug dealer Frank Bowers, which she kept secret from Chloe, but she left him after he became violent towards her.

As memos from Principal Wells' office reveal, Rachel was accused of drug dealing by Nathan and [David Madsen](david_madsen.md). In her defense, she claimed that David was following her and taking pictures, but Wells didn't take any side's accusations seriously due to Rachel's acquaintance with Frank at that point. Arcadia Bay Police Department reports indicate that David actually caught her with "controlled substances" at school.

Secret files from David's computer furthermore reveal that he was actually investigating her for some time before her disappearance. Moreover, they prove that she was cutting school and meeting up with Frank at least one week before her disappearance.

She regularly attended Vortex Club parties. The last one she attended was probably on March 28, just one month before she went officially missing on April 22 after she met someone who "changed her life".

After an unknown period of time, the [Arcadia Bay Police Department](arcadia_bay_police_department.md) decided to close investigations on Rachel's disappearance, and even her parents gave up hope looking for her. Only Chloe didn't want to give up, believing she was still out there and distributed Missing Person posters all over the town.

When we later search Chloe's room for the CD, we can see that she obviously had a close relationship with Rachel. In her lockbox by the bed, we discover the original photograph from the Missing Person poster; originally a shot of the two girls together. Chloe is responsible for creating and putting up the posters, if you look around Chloe's room you can find a postcard from Rachel.

She tells Max that Rachel's parents have given up hope looking for her, choosing to believe she just moved away, rather than face the unknown. Chloe reveals that they had planned to gather enough funds to move to Los Angeles together, to start a new life. Chloe believes Rachel is still out there, and never would have left Arcadia without her.
