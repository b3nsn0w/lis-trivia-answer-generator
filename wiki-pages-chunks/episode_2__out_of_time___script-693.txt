Reported Nathan and/or made fun of VictoriaReported Nathan and/or made fun of Victoria

*Max's room will be vandalized if she did either of the above.''

**Max (thinking):** No fucking way! This is not why I came to Blackwell. And I still have to clean all this crap up? After I find Kate's book...

''Reported Nathan: "NOBODY MESSES WITH ME BITCH" will be written in red letters over Max's selfie wall. There will also be a defaced photo of Max on her bed.*

*Made fun of Victoria: "CRAPPY ARTIST FILTHY WHORE" will be written on Max's mirror and the photo of Victoria covered in paint will be stolen.*

*In both instances some of Max's stuff will be scattered near her bed.*

*Max can clean up her room by:*
* *Putting away the defaced photo of herself (only if she reported Nathan)*
* *Tidying up the mess near her bed''
**Max (thinking):** Ta da! I do love a clean room. Very zen. Except for that bullshit graffiti.

''Max's room will be untouched.*

*Max gets dressed at her closet.''

**Max (thinking):** Maybe I'll just put on a shirt and jeans. Hey, Einstein had the same exact suit for every day of the week. And he couldn't even rewind time.

''Optional: Max searches for Kate's book in the clutter on her couch.*

**Max (thinking):** No book here...

*Optional: Max searches for Kate's book in the clutter at her desk.''

**Max (thinking):** My desk is a pigsty, but...I know it ain't there.

''Optional: Max searches for Kate's book in the clutter on the floor.*

**Max (thinking):** And nothing here.

*Max searches the clutter on the end table next to the couch. She lifts up a piece of paper and finds the book, but accidentally spills a cup of soda all over it.''

**Max (thinking):** Of course you just spilled soda on Kate's book. Better fix this fast. Kate needs the book and I don't want to add to her list of problems.

*Max rewinds, then moves the cup.*

**Max (thinking):** Begone, foul soft drink!

*Max takes the book.*

**Max (thinking):** Aha, you sneaky book, you're mine! Now I can finally take this back to Kate before I'm late. As if I have to worry about being late anymore... I do have all the time in the world now.

*Max leaves her room.*

''Kate's slate will have insults written on it. Max can erase them.*

*Max knocks on Kate's door.''

**Max:** Kate? You in there?

**Kate (from inside her room):** Yes, I'm here. Come in, Max...
