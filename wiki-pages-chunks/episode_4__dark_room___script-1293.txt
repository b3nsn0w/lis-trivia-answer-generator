(Courtney wrote Max's name on the list)(Courtney wrote Max's name on the list)

**Courtney:** Max! Our guest star arrives fashionably late! Say “Bonsoir” to the “End of the World”! Even though you flaked on my party make-over...You still get special access to the Vortex Club VIP lounge…

**Max:** You better let your minion know since she won't let me pass.

**Courtney:** Oh, that little asshole just made her last mistake. She thinks she’s Victoria. Buh bye. Now, let’s go make an official VIP entrance, Max Factor! Get it… ?

**Courtney:** Hey Sarah, do you know that I personally put Max’s name on the list? So you like, decide to block her from coming in while I’m taking a break? You’re not in charge here.

**Sarah:** Wait, I just... I…

**Courtney:** Oh my God, you’re done. And you’re off the list, permanently. Welcome to the Vortex Club.

**Courtney:** What is Max Caulfield doing at a Vortex Club party? It really must be the end of the world… get it? But seriously, like, what do you want?

**Max:** I didn't want to be alone tonight after this week, so I'm even on the guest list. But "Zuul the Gatekeeper" won't let me pass.

**Courtney:** You got on the list? That’s very…unlikely but let’s check it out. Follow me…

**Courtney:** Sarah, our friend Max here claims she’s on the list. Just for shits and giggles, let’s see.

**Courtney:** No way…

**Max:** Yes, way. That’s my name right there...

**Courtney:** Oh. My. God. Do you think I’m that dumb, Max? That’s not even my handwriting and I’m in charge of the list! Victoria is right, you are so fucking weird! Well, this is the closest you will ever get to the Vortex Club again. Promise. Yes, you can leave now, Max. The party’s over.

|-|(Max isn't on the list)(Max isn't on the list)

**Courtney:** What is Max Caulfield doing at a Vortex Club party? It really must be the end of the world… get it? But seriously, like, what do you want?

**Max:** I didn't want to be alone tonight after this week… so I thought it'd be nice to hang out in the VIP section.

**Courtney:** Yes, it is very nice. If you're in the Vortex Club, which you're not and will never be. So, excuse me...

(Kate lived)# (Kate lived)

**Hayden:** Look, up in the sky—it's Super Max, here to save the party!

**Max:** Have you seen Nathan?

|-|(Kate died)(Kate died)

**Hayden:** Oh, hey, Max... I didn't think you'd actually come tonight...

**Max:** Well, I didn't think anybody would want to party after Kate Marsh killed herself this week... Have you seen Nathan?

**Hayden:** I just vaped some dank OG bud, so I can barely see you... or these hotties next to me. You want a hit?

Nathan.# Nathan.

**Max:** No, I want to find Nathan.

**Hayden:** Me too. He's supposed to be bringing some special party favors... I hope... at the party... you actually plan to party at the party.

|-|No, thanks.No, thanks.

**Max:** No, thanks.

**Hayden:** Come on, come on, I would kill to see you baked. Get that stick out of your ass. You need to get high more than anybody I know... next to me.

**Max:** Not this week. So, has anybody here seen Nathan?

**Hayden:** I guess you have to go ask everybody here... or you can sit down and take a quick hit.

Sean Prescott.# Sean Prescott.

**Max:** Hayden, does Sean Prescott pay for the Vortex Club parties?

**Hayden:** What doesn't he pay for? The Prescotts shit money. How else could we afford DJ Doomsday to spin?

**Max:** The Prescott family is literally making you dance...

|-|Victoria.Victoria.

**Max:** What about Victoria?

**Hayden:** God, go ask her yourself. I would, but like I said... I'm fucking ripped.

**Max:** Maybe you better take it easy tonight.

**Hayden:** Whatever. I'm in this world to have fun... try it sometime, Max. I finally get you and Dana to come out to a Vortex Club party, but you just want to lecture me... Gee, thanks, "Mr. Madsen."

**Max:** How much fun did Kate have at your last party? Listen, Hayden... just watch out for Nathan tonight.

**Hayden:** I think that's your job, Max. Come back when you're ready to have fun...
