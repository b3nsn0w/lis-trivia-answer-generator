'*Max *(thinking)*:*' Take a breath, Max...Go through all this data and you can find out where Nathan took Kate after the party!

''Max takes the screenshot of Nathan's text messages to Frank, the record of their transaction on October 4th, and the photo of the barn.*

*Max deduces the remaining clues and brings a photo of a barn to Chloe.*

**Max:** Chloe, this is definitely the place.

**Chloe:** Let me dig up some more clues here.

*Chloe tries looking up info about the barn. ''

**Chloe:** Nope... Nothing, Max. There's nothing here. Just some shitty old barn...

**Max:** Let's keep searching and find out who owns this haunted barn.

**Chloe:** I'm on this, hold on.

*Chloe searches the barn.*

**Chloe:** Somebody named—"Harry Aaron Prescott."

**Max:** I'm shocked. Should we call the police?

**Chloe:** Fuck that. You know the police here are like Nathan's private security, right?

**Max:** That's so messed up...

**Chloe:** As you've noticed, this whole town is messed up. We can't trust anybody... Except each other. So we have to go out to that farmhouse by ourselves.

**Max:** I was afraid you'd say that. We could call Warren, since he kicked Nathan's ass...

**Chloe:** It's just the two of us. Nobody else. And I'm not scared at all. You have the power. I feel like we're this close to finding Rachel... We have to find her, Max.

**Max:** We will. But remember, my power isn't infinite. We still have to be careful. Do you hear, Chloe?

**Chloe:** Yes, sir.

''Max and Chloe leave Chloe's room to find the barn. Chloe's computer remains on, showing a map and the coordinates of the barn.*
