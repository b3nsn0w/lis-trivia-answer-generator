## Unresolved Issues and Open Questions 
There are many ideas developed throughout the season that weren't resolved in the final episode and a lot of questions remaining unanswered.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v# 29FVl2INSZk 10 unanswered questions] This can partly be explained with the ambiguous or metaphorical ways of the game.[https://www.gamereactor.eu/news/288154/Life+is+Strange+-+%22Supernatural+things+merely+metaphors%22/ "Supernatural things merely metaphors"] (Gamereactor, Jan 26, 2015)
* Where did Max's powers come from?
** If there is a reason, for what exact purpose were they given to her? How long did she have them?
** If she had her powers her whole life, why is it that she couldn't use them earlier?
** Did her powers come from the blue butterfly?
* Did or how did the powers create the storm by messing with time, changing the course of everything and jumping into alternative realities, why did she get the powers in the first place unless to be with Chloe?
** If yes, why did Max's first vision happen before her first rewind?
*** A possible explanation is that Max's powers were caused by the storm, a destiny that awaited her if she used them. In this way, her powers are a Pandora's Box of sorts, a disaster waiting to happen.
*** Another explanation is that the storm was most likely caused by a 4th dimensional tearing in the space-time continuum when Max first used her powers, as Warren hinted in Episode 5.
* Does the sacrifice of Chloe have consequences for the timeline?
** Time travel is technically not meant for saving lives and sacrificing Chloe prevented many deaths from happening. Would that affect the timeline in a good or bad way?
** Strangely, Chloe died many times throughout the game other than being shot by Nathan, but the unusual events are still happening.
* Does Max still have her time controlling ability after her final decision, especially in the Sacrifice Chloe ending?
** If yes, will she keep using it or stop using it altogether?
* What does the butterfly's appearance at the beginning of the game and in the Sacrifice Chloe ending signify? Does it encourage Max to try again, if it was the butterfly that gave here the rewinding powers?
** What was the true purpose of the butterfly? Is it a spirit animal?
*** If yes, then it is Chloe's spirit animal, or Rachel's?
* What about the mystery surrounding [Pan Estates](pan_estates.md) and the allusions to Native Americans and their spiritual culture presented throughout?
* What about Samuel and his mysterious behavior, talking about spirit animals and a non-scientific explanation for the strange phenomena at Arcadia Bay?
* What is the purpose of the mystical, transparent doe that appears to Max throughout the episodes?
** Is it a spirit animal and is it connected to Max or Rachel?
* Who is the owner of the [:Thread:9247 Twilight Zone](_twilight_zone_.md) number plate, and are they of any significance to the plot?
* What was the true purpose of the nightmare? Was it trying to tell Max something important or was it trying to deceive her?
* Do the other realities Max creates continue to run parallel to her current one after she leaves them, or are they destroyed? If not, do the other Maxes keep their powers, or are they only available to the primary Max in whichever reality she's currently in? Additionally, do the small adjustments Max makes create entirely new realities just to accommodate the change? Or is the current reality simply rewound for Max to resume from the point she desires?
* Can the toll Max's powers take on her actually be lethal? Or only wear her down to the point where she can't use them for a bit, as seen on the rooftop with Kate?
* Who really lived or died in the "Sacrifice Arcadia Bay" ending?It is revealed nearly four years after this event that the only other confirmed survivors are David and Victoria. Though Mark Jefferson is mentioned on Victoria's letter if this ending is chosen, his fate remains unknown. It is also revealed that Joyce died in the storm. Since Warren, Frank and Pompidou (if they weren't killed) are with her in the Two Whales Diner, it is presumed that they too didn't survive.
** What about the Prescott family? Did they survive the storm?The officially licensed [Life is Strange (Comic Series)](comic_series.md) by *Titan Comics* hints that the Prescott family survived the storm and are planning to rebuild Arcadia Bay. However, this story is just "one of many possibilities." See [http://lifeisstrange-blog.tumblr.com/post/176098141569/the-first-official-lifeisstrange-comic-from-titan here] for Comic series author Emma Vieceli's stance on the story. DONTNOD had no involvement with the series. *(This entry was written based on information from Issue #1 which was the only issue released at the time of writing.)*
** What about everyone at Blackwell Academy and the Hospital?
*** Since Blackwell and the Hospital are solid brick buildings, they should've been able to withstand the storm, meaning that everyone inside them may have survived.
