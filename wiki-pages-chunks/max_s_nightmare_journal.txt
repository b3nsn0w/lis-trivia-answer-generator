#  Max's Nightmare Journal 

[File:Maxnightmarejournal.png](thumb.md)In [Maxine Caulfield](max.md)'s [Max's Nightmare](nightmare.md) scenes, opening [Max's Journal](max_s_journal.md) reveals violent and contorted versions of her entries with a degree of self-loathing. This also effects her pictures, texts and character notes.

##  Diary Entry 
###  Left Page 
Maxine, you keep fucking up. How many times does [Chloe Price](chloe.md) have to die in front of you? Maybe it would be better to actually, you know, have a life?

* THE DOE A LIE THE DOE IS A LIE THE DOE

* MAX IN THE DARK ROOM *(repeated about 8 times)*

* FIND MY CAT PIX. PLEASE. MY HEART IS BROKEN.

* CHLOE CHLOE CHLOE *(CHLOE backwards)*

* ALWAYS TAKE THE SHOT

###  Right Page 
TAKE A SELFIE, HO! Yes, you're running out of choices. Let's All Go To The [Lighthouse](lighthouse.md)! Max, why do you want to kill everybody? What did everybody ever do to you? Bully.

* DEATH DEATH ONLY DEATH ONLY DEATH ONLY DEATH ONLY DEATH ONLY CHLOE 

* NO NO

* GO FUCK YOUR SELFIE *(repeated 4 times)*

* RACHEL RACHEL RACHEL *([Rachel Amber](rachel.md) backwards)*

##  Pictures 
Max's journal in the nightmare sequence displays various scribbles and pictures that are a part of her subconscious anxieties.
Notable among these are: 
* An instant camera shooting out blood (similar to the one Chloe gave her) alongside [Mark Jefferson](mr__jefferson.md)'s advice to "always take the shot."
* Skulls with a deer skull.
* Multiple eyes.
* Chloe's head on a butterfly with a ripped wing.
