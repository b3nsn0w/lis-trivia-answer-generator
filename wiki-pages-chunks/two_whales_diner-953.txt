[File:diner-walloffame.png](thumb.md) The "Fishing Wall Of Fame" is located in the corner of the diner closest to the jukebox. Awards are given each month to fishermen that catch fish which are significant, but how they are significant is unspecified. The awards are given by the [Arcadia Bay Fishing Club](arcadia_bay_fishing_club.md) according to the banner underneath the display. 
* White Surgeon, caught by [Dick Weber](dick_weber.md)
* Steelhead trout, caught by [Andy Berry](andy_berry.md)
* Chinook Salmon, caught by [Rich Conrad](rich_conrad.md)

In the bathroom, there are many instances of graffiti, some of which are also observable. 
* "The 7th sign: The sea and sky will turn black, and living things will die because of it."This is an incredibly ominous reference to the eco-disaster later in the game. It also foreshadows the destruction of the Bay.
* The Doe - next to the hand-drier, similar to the one on Max's shirt.
