## **Optional Conversation with Kate** 
**Max:** Hi, Kate.

**Kate:** Oh, hi Max.

I hope I didn't embarrass you...# I hope I didn't embarrass you...

**Max:** Kate, I hope I didn't embarrass you with my lame answer.

**Kate:** It sucks to be dragged into the spotlight.

**Max:** Unless you're Victoria.

**Kate:** She's got nothing on you, Max. Well, I should get going.

**Max:** Yeah, me too. Talk to you later.

**Kate:** Sure.

|-|You seem quiet today.You seem quiet today.

**Max:** You seem quiet today.

**Kate:** Just thinking too much...

{{#tag:tabber|Victoria has already won...# Victoria has already won...

**Max:** I think Victoria has already won the contest... As usual.

**Kate:** She's got nothing on you, Max. Well, I should get going.

**Max:** Yeah, me too. Talk to you later.

**Kate:** Sure.

{{!}}-{{!}}Want to grab a cup o' tea?Want to grab a cup o' tea?

**Max:** No worries. Let's hang later.

**Kate:** Sure.

'''Jefferson and Victoria's conversation**

**Mr. Jefferson:''' Yes, Victoria, you still have to do your homework this week, even if you're submitting your photo for the competition. Everybody in class is turning a photo, so you see the dilemma.

**Victoria:** I know, Mr. Jefferson. I just worked so hard on this shot, and I'm sure you know what it's like to be consumed by your work. I just really think "Everyday Heroes" is an important cultural event and I want to represent Blackwell Academy.

**Mr. Jefferson:** You have just by participating, by putting yourself out there in the world. Well, no matter who wins, this is just a bump on a bigger road. I don't want anybody to feel excluded from this process. But I also want everybody to know that this photographic world is not for everybody. I had my moment in the camera eye and everybody should have that chance, right?

**Victoria:** Oh, totally. I only want to share whatever gifts I have with the world...

## **Conversation with Jefferson** 

(Max initiates the conversation)# (Max initiates the conversation)

*Max approaches Victoria and Jefferson.*

**Max:** Excuse me, Mr. Jefferson, can I talk to you for a moment?

**Victoria:** Yes, excuse you.

**Mr. Jefferson:** No, Victoria, excuse us.

|-|(Max tries to leave)(Max tries to leave)

**Mr. Jefferson:** I see you, Max Caulfield. Don't even think about leaving here until we talk about your entry.

*Max turns around and approaches Victoria and Jefferson.*

**Mr. Jefferson:** I'd never let one of photography's future stars avoid handing in her picture.

Do I have to?# Do I have to?

**Max:** Do I have to? I just don't think it's that big a deal.

|-|I didn't have any time...I didn't have any time...

**Max:** I didn't have any time... Way too much homework.

**Mr. Jefferson:** Max, you're a better photographer than a liar... Now I know it's a drag to hear some old dude lecture you... but life won't wait for you to play catch-up. You're young, the world is yours, blah blah blah, right? But you do have a gift, you have the fever to take images, to frame the world only the way you envision it. Now, all you need is the courage to share your gift with others. That's what separates the artist, from the amateur.

*Max leaves the art class.*

**Corridor**

**Max:** *(thinking)* Welcome to the real world...

*[Juliet Watson](juliet.md) and [Zachary Riggins](zachary.md) start walking across the [Blackwell Academy Hallway](hallway.md).*

**Max:** *(thinking)* I need a serious timeout in the bathroom. Splash water on my face and make sure I don't look like a total loser.

'''Juliet and Zachary's conversation in the background**

**Juliet:''' You didn't tell me how cute I looked yet.

**Zachary:** I was about to. You always look cute.

**Juliet:** Just cute?

**Zachary:** Hot.

**Juliet:** Then I might send you a special picture during class.

'''[Courtney Wagner](courtney.md) and Taylor's conversation**

**Courtney:** Why would anybody want to carry around a dorky instamatic?

**Taylor:** Because Max wants everybody to see how hip she is.

**Courtney:** As if. She plays it so shy.

**Taylor:''' She's so fucking shy she takes selfies with a giant camera.

*Max puts on her headphones and the music starts playing. Max walks along the corridor and then enters the bathroom.*

**Bathroom**

**Max:** *(taking off earphones, thinking)* Empty. Good. Nobody can see my meltdown. Except for me.

*Max washes her face using one of the sinks, then takes out her polaroid photo.*

**Max:** *(looking at her photo, thinking)* Just relax. Stop torturing yourself. You have "a gift".

**Max:** Fuck it.

*Max tears apart her photo and drops it on the floor.*

*A blue butterfly flies in and lands on a bucket, behind a stall. Max follows after.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* When a door closes, a window opens... Or, something like that. Okay girl, you don't get a photo op like this everyday...

*Max approaches the butterfly and takes a photo of it. The butterfly takes off and lands on a sink. [Nathan Prescott](nathan.md) enters the bathroom, closing the door behind him. Max hears the sound and turns around.*
