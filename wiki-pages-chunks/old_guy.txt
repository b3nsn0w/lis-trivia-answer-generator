> No time for chit-chat. I'm a millionaire, yep. Got my lottery ticket right here.

**The Old Guy to [Maxine Caulfield**, Max](maxine_caulfield____max.md) in "[Episode 2: Out of Time, Out of Time](episode_2__out_of_time__out_of_time.md)"

The **"Old Guy"** is a resident of [Arcadia Bay](arcadia_bay.md). He is standing at the bus stop near the [Two Whales Diner](two_whales_diner.md) in "[Episode 2: Out of Time](out_of_time.md)," and can be seen inside the diner in "[Episode 3: Chaos Theory](chaos_theory.md)."

##  Episode Two - "[Episode 2: Out of Time](out_of_time.md)" 
When [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) is getting off the school bus, this man can be heard talking to [Diner Woman](a_woman.md) standing nearby. He is holding a lottery ticket in his right hand, and tells both Max and the woman he is going to be a millionaire as long as nobody steals the ticket from him and the bus comes in time so he can cash it in. Max thinks that he has seen a lot of changes to Arcadia Bay during his lifetime. If Max tries to talk to him, he will respond that he has "no time for chit-chat" and he's waiting for the bus. He also tells Max to get her own lottery ticket.

##  Episode Three - "[Episode 3: Chaos Theory](chaos_theory.md)" 
This time he is sitting inside the diner. A pair of doughnuts lie on a plate in front of him, but for some reason he isn't eating. Max cannot interact with him.

##  Episode Five - "[Episode 5: Polarized](polarized.md)" 
He can be seen sitting on the floor of the Two Whales diner, probably injured. [Joyce Price](joyce_price.md) will be helping him while Max talks to [Frank Bowers](frank_bowers.md) (if he did not die in Episode 4) about [Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md). He also appears in the diner scene of [Max's Nightmare](max_s_nightmare.md), standing behind the counter. He tells Max that he hopes she can live with herself after these events.

He apparently dies in the Sacrifice Arcadia Bay ending, but since the Two Whales Diner is partially standing the aftermath of the storm, it is possible he may have survived.

##  Symbolism 
This man and the woman can be considered opposites of each other in many ways:
# The man states he's going to be a millionaire, while the woman has trouble with money.
# The man brushes off Max's attempt to talk to him, while the woman is nice to Max and even thanks her for reassurance.
# Their genders are opposite.
It is probably not a simple coincidence that they are standing near each other.
