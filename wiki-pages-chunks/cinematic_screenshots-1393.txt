## Instructions 
Prerequisites:
*Replace the "Assembly-Csharp.dll" file in [SteamApps]\common\Life is Strange - Before the Storm\Life is Strange - Before the Storm_Data\Managed" with the modified one by Haoose and create a backup of the original one.

Activating the freecam in-game with player controls:
*Have [https://cheatengine.org/downloads.php Cheat Engine] (Use the portable version which doesn't include an {{Wiki|adware}}-packed installer) opened, select the process and load the linked [http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id# 656832219 Cheat Engine table].
*Load the area you would like to explore in [Collectible Mode](collectible_mode.md).
*Press **F9** to activate the freecam.
*Activate Cheat Engine's mono features to use the DOF adjustments.
*Hide the HUD with **H**.
*Hide the outlines with **N**.
*Tweak all settings to your liking using the debug mode and Cheat Engine table.

Optionally pause the game time by hiding the UI and pressing escape. This will pause the whole game world and you will still be able to explore around because the pause UI is hidden. (Possibly requires an older version of the table)
