## '''Nathan and Chloe's conversation with Max's knowledge** 

**Max:'* *(thinking)* Okay, Max, retrace every step... *[approaches the sink]* I washed my face... *[washes face]* I shredded my photo... *[tears up photo]* Then the...butterfly flew in... And I took a photo...

*Max takes a photo of the butterfly. Nathan and Chloe enter the bathroom.*

**Nathan:** Leave them out of this, bitch.

**Chloe:** I can tell everybody Nathan Prescott is a punk ass who begs like a little girl and talks to himself—

*Nathan pulls out his gun.''

**Nathan:** You don't know who the fuck I am or who you're messing around with!

**Chloe:** Where'd you get that? What are you doing? Come on, put that thing down!

**Max:** *(thinking)* Wowser, it's happening again.

**Nathan:** Don't EVER tell me what to do. I'm so SICK of people trying to control me!

**Chloe:** You are going to get in hella more trouble for this than drugs—

**Nathan:** Nobody would ever even miss your "punk ass", would they?

**Chloe:** Get that gun away from me, psycho!

*Nathan kills Chloe and drops his gun on the ground. He then starts to shake Chloe and walk around the bathroom nervously.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Holy shit, I can't let this happen... If I can reverse time again, I can help her.

**Nathan:** Oh... Shit! No, no, no, no...

*Max rewinds.*

*Max looks at the fire alarm.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* I need a hammer to break it open!

**Nathan:** Don't EVER tell me what to do. I'm so SICK of people trying to control me!

**Chloe:** You are going to get in hella more trouble for this than drugs—

**Nathan:** Nobody would ever even miss your "punk ass", would they?

*Max moves a maintenance cart, grabs a hammer from the floor and breaks the fire alarm glass with it. She then starts the fire alarm. Nathan stops pointing his gun at Chloe and looks behind him.*

**Nathan:** No way...

*Chloe knees Nathan in the stomach or groin and pushes him to the floor.*

**Chloe:** Don't EVER touch me again, freak!

''Chloe exits the bathroom. Nathan picks up his gun and notices the pieces of Max's photo on the floor.*

**Nathan:** Another shitty day...

*Nathan exits the bathroom.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* That did not happen! This cannot be real! I just saw a girl get shot and then saved her! What the fuck is going on? Do. Not. Freak. Out.

*Max exits the bathroom.''

**Corridor**

## **Conversation with [David](david.md)** 

**David:** Hey, do you hear that fire alarm? That means you should be outside.

**Max:** I had to use the bathroom...

**David:** Girls always use that excuse.

**Max:** Excuse for what?

**David:** For whatever you're up to. Your face is covered in guilt.

**Max:** The alarm tripped me out.

**David: **Then trip on out of here, missy. Or are you hiding something? Huh?

**[Raymond Wells](principal_wells.md):** Thank you Mr. Madsen, the situation is under control. There's no emergency here. Leave Miss Caulfield alone and please turn off that alarm, since that's your job.

*David walks away.*
