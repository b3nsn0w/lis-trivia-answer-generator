machineries of time that I keep breaking...*

*So I did it. Back in my room again, erasing another timeline... or does that reality go on without me? Am I just creating knots in time? My biggest fear is that I won't be able to rewind when I most need to... or even remember what I've done.*

*And my head does feel like it's going to burst if I keep on doing this. My nosebleeds are a bad omen. Yet I'm here â€” I can rip up my contest photo and still warn David about Jefferson. It just means I won't be going to San Francisco. Yet. And I have to protect Chloe from one storm.*

*I knew things were going too easy. And I messed it all up. As usual.Jefferson was pissed that I had torn up my contest photo, freaking out about my "wasted talent." Bastard torched my diary, so I couldn't even rewind using my art class selfie.So my whole plan took a shit and I couldn't text David about Jefferson...which is how I ended up back in this evil Dark Room, after I thought I had escaped.*

Warned Victoria Successfully# Warned Victoria Successfully
*The worst thing was seeing that Victoria was gone and knowing that Jefferson had already killed her... all because of me. I've never felt so helpless and hopeless in my life. It made me even more determined to rewind time and save Victoria as well...*

*Amazingly, it was David Madsen who turned up to save me. Thanks to his own surveillance, he was almost Jefferson's shadow and tracked him down to the farmhouse.I was able to use my rewind for good and actually help David battle Jefferson.I do know that the only way I can save Chloe now is to get that picture that Warren took of us in the parking lot. I just hope he's okay in this storm.*

Told DavidTold David*Finally, I told David that Chloe was dead... and he killed Jefferson. I have nothing else to say.''

*For the first time since my visions, I was able to see the storm manifest in this reality. When I felt the sharp wind from the tornado, everything became more desperate. I was so relieved to get ahold of Warren, but he's definitely trapped in the Two Whales diner with the photo. Yes, this looks like a job for Super Max.*

*I borrowed Jefferson's car to haul ass and found that Nathan left me a sad voicemail. He only wanted to warn me, to not be blamed for Rachel. But Jefferson wouldn't forgive him....*

*Apocalypse Arcadia Bay.I never felt the raw force of nature, but this storm is ground zero. My town is being destroyed and I'm so furious that I didn't pay more attention to my visions. I could have warned and saved so many people... instead of watching them die around me.*

*I decided I needed to fulfill my destiny, whatever that was, and use my powers for good and more importantly, to not be afraid. There was no more time for fear.So I barely made it to town and helped as much as I could, until I had to rewind to stop a raging fire from blowing up the diner. At least I was able to do something.*

Frank Became An AllyFrank Became An Ally*I almost cried when I saw Joyce and Warren, even though they were scared. But they're strong and helped everybody in the diner. Including Frank, who I was glad to see alive.*

Kissed Chloe# Kissed Chloe*I'm glad Warren is such a good friend. Considering how insane my life has been this week, kissing Chloe instead of him didn't seem that strange. It felt like Chloe and I were flipping off the cruel universe... and if I was going to die, I wanted one kiss from my best friend.*
|-|Kissed WarrenKissed Warren*Considering how insane my life has been this week, kissing Warren in the middle of a deadly storm didn't seem to be that strange. It felt like we were flipping off the cruel universe... and if I was going to die, I wanted one kiss from a boy I cared about.*
|-|Kissed Both# Kissed Both *Considering how insane my life has been this week, kissing Chloe, then Warren, didn't seem to be that strange. Both times it felt like we were flipping off the cruel universe... and if I was going to die, I wanted one kiss from two people I truly cared about.*
|-|Kissed None Of ThemKissed None Of Them *Considering how insane my life has been this week, kissing Chloe or Warren in the middle of all this time warping would be too strange. I can't even think about my love life... or lack of one. But if I was going to die, maybe I should have kissed one of them for posterity...*

*The main thing was that I had Warren's photo and I would get one last chance to save Chloe. I felt queasy considering what a mess I've made, but there was no going back anymore.*

*Warren rules. I was able to rewind to the End Of The World party with his photo and I felt like I was getting more confident with my time travel skills. It's always hard to deal with Chloe when only I have the benefit of knowing her future. But the one thing Chloe appreciates the most is honesty so I told her everything, from when she was paralyzed to the Dark Room to San Francisco. She didn't want to believe that David was so
