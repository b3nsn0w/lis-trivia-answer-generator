* Chloe's license plate "TWN PKS" is a reference to the 1990 drama *Twin Peaks,* an American television serial drama, which also takes place in Pacific Northwest and is centered around the mysterious disappearance of a well liked teenage girl prior to the series start. There are also two hills in San Francisco (the city where Chloe's parents took a photo together when Joyce was expecting Chloe) with the same name. It is a very prominent tourist attraction.
*Also in the parking lot Max spots [Frank Bowers](frank_bowers.md)'s sleeping dog and calls it "{{Wiki|Cujo}}". Cujo is a rabid canine and central character in the same-titled novel written by Stephen King.
*There's a reference to the [w:c:meme:LOL Guy](lol_guy_meme.md) in Chloe's truck.
*When looking at Warren's new car on the parking lot, Max calls it his "{{Wiki|WABAC machine|Wayback Machine}}", a reference to the time machine from the 1960/70s American animated television series *{{Wiki|The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show}}*, which was used to visit and alter famous events in human history.
*Warren suggests Max could've started a {{Wiki|Kickstarter}} fund with a photograph of Victoria covered in paint if the player chooses to comfort Victoria instead of making fun of her.

## Chloe's Truck 
*On the dashboard of [Chloe's Truck](chloe_s_truck.md) stands a bobble head which appears to be based on the "Wacky Wobbler '68 Special" bobble head of {{Wiki|Elvis Presley}} by the Funko company.
