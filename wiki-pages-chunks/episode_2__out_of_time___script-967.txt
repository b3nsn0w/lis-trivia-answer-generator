**Max:** Warren, what are you doing here?

**Warren:** Oh, nothing--waiting. For a call? I mean, I already took the call... Anyway, I wanted to rap about that action yesterday.

Thank you!Thank you!**Max:** By the way, thank you for stepping in. You were pretty badass, Warren. I owe you.

|-|That was intense!# That was intense!**Max:** That was intense. Everything happened so fast. I owe you.

**Warren:** Oh, yes, you do. I got knocked on my ass by that dick. I'm some personal superhero.

**Max:** You're a real "Everyday Hero." You stood up to a bully and it was awesome.

**Warren:** Even though you left me with said bully and ran off with that girl... She's pretty punk rock, how do you know her?

Chloe Price.Chloe Price.**Max:** An old friend. Chloe Price? We haven't seen each other in a while.

|-|Just a pirate.# Just a pirate.**Max:** Just a pirate I used to know.

|-|Don't get involved.# Don't get involved.**Max:** He's dangerous. I don't want you to get involved. You got me there, but lay low, Nathan Prescott will get his karma soon.

**Warren:** Weird fucking week. Like that bizarro snowfall yesterday. Speaking of dystopia, that drive-in is having a 70's "Planet of the Apes" marathon. Let's "Go Ape"!

Yes.Yes.**Max:** Yes, that's exactly what I need. I love those old-school ape films.

**Warren:** Well, that was easier than I thought. Cool. I'll text you the info.

|-|No.# No.**Max:** No, I don't think I can concentrate on going out to the movies. I just feel like escaping.

**Warren:** Fine. Be a damned dirty human. I'll "Go Ape" myself.

*Max leaves the Dormitories. She walks across the Main Campus and notices David Madsen and Nathan Prescott arguing.*

**Max (thinking):** David talking to Nathan cannot be a good thing. This has something to do with Kate...or Rachel...

*Max takes a seat on the school bus and begins to listen to music with her earphones. She stares out the window as the streets of Arcadia Bay fly past.*

*The bus stops in front of the Two Whales Diner and Max gets off.*
