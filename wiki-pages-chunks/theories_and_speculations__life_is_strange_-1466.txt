Here is a section of the wiki page for Theories and Speculations (Life is Strange):

## Principal Wells 
* There is the possibility of a link between Wells and Jefferson, as well as the Prescotts. Obviously, the Prescotts nearly own Blackwell and therefore [Raymond Wells](principal_wells.md) must keep them happy in order to facilitate their continued funding of Blackwell.

* Nathan and Wells share meaningful looks in the office after Kate's incident, implying that Wells is in some way involved and must take Nathan's side in the situation. However, in the right scenarios he does suspend Nathan, which could indicate that he is actually uninvolved with the mysterious disappearances, and that he is simply a principal attempting to keep his school afloat.

*There is a bottle of whiskey in the Prescott Bunker which is a possible link to Wells, as he is a known alcoholic due to the stressful nature of his occupation. It is possible he is involved with the Prescotts in some way, in a deeper sense than just keeping them happy enough to retain funding for Blackwell. Keeping them happy may entail keeping quiet about their involvement in the disappearances, or possibly assisting them.

## Rachel Amber 
* Some fans have speculated that the storm is Rachel Amber's wrath for the injustice that was done to her and also later to Chloe when she was shot in the bathroom at Blackwell Academy. Given that Max has powers herself, the possibility is there when Chloe says, "this storm could be Rachelâ€™s Revenge... Our revenge..."
**Note: These are theories developed prior to the release of Episode 5: Polarized.**
* There were many fan theories about Rachel and her whereabouts. Some even suggested that Rachel Amber was Max from an alternative timeline.
* One theory was also that Rachel wasn't actually dead, but rather working together with Jefferson, as it was rumored they had slept with each other and both had their affections for photography and modeling which could have hooked them up.
* In that case, it was assumed that the supposedly dead body of Rachel Amber that is buried on the junkyard could be a deer instead since there is a ghost of a deer that's always there.
* Another theory is that the Ghost Doe that disappears at the end of Episode 4 is the spirit of Rachel that moves on once her body is found by Max and Chloe. This theory has later been confirmed by the developers.

#

## Samuel 
* Samuel has an array of fashion items that can be found in the [Custodial Room](janitorial_shed.md), including sunglasses, a scarf, and magazines. It is possible that Samuel has an interest in fashion, and maybe even a desire to become a fashion photographer.

* From the beginning of the game, Samuel seems very mysterious and it is possible that he has some kind of connection to Arcadia Bay or Blackwell. This theory is furthered by his lecture about spirit animals and his heightened distress at the unusual occurrences that unfold throughout the week.

* When talking to Max about her spirit animal guiding her to Rachel, he uses the phrase "body", which indicates his possible knowledge about Rachel being dead.

## Warren 
There is some speculation that [Warren Graham](warren_graham.md)'s character actually has a darker side than is apparent at first sight. It suggests that Warren could possess a violent nature along with a strong desire for a sexual relationship with Max rather than a romantic one. It is based on the following observations:

* After you return the flash drive to him, Warren mentions a very disturbing movie called *Cannibal Holocaust* which portrays graphic brutality, sexual assault, and violence towards animals. Warren says that he "laughed his ass off" watching it.

* In a note that he leaves in Max's room he mentions another movie called *Ultravixens*, which is a film containing excessive pornography.

*He spies on Max from courtyard in the beginning of Episode 2

* In Episode 3, Max finds a developed photo of herself and Warren inside his locker in the boy's changing room at the swimming pool. Her surprised attitude could suggest that this photo is not one they have taken together, and instead this is a photo Warren edited and pieced together. This is backed up by the fact that Warren mentions he is good at using graphical editing software in response to discovering that Daniel had posted a portrait of Max online, and she asks him if he can draw.

#

## Kate 
*The name "Katie" appears in [Frank Bowers](frank_bowers.md)'s client list (codenamed as "Chihuahua"). It was speculated that Kate may have bought drugs from Frank in her depressed state, as Chihuahua would be a fitting dog type for Kate and "Katie" bought a sleeping drug called green dream and a drug that causes death (both uses would be fitting for Kate in her sleepless and suicidal circumstances). It's more unlikely that Kate would use weed and acid (the other drugs under Katie's name in the book), and none of the transactions took place in Blackwell itself where she spends most of her time. Kate can't even say a swear word, let alone become involved with Frank or drug use. It has been confirmed by the developers that the "Katie" on Frank's list is not Kate Marsh.

*It's very likely that Kate survived the storm in the Sacrifice Arcadia Bay ending, since the hospital is a solid brick building that could have been able to withstand the storm as opposed to the destroyed wooden buildings that are shown in this ending. Also, hospitals do usually have underground storm shelters, and Arcadia Bay is known to have a lot of bomb shelters.According to a document from the [Prescott Barn](prescott_barn.md), the Prescotts had brought "a bomb shelter boom" over the town.

*Additionally, Kate could have been released by the hospital after a 48-hour hold period, by which time her family would have visited (as she mentions they would during Max's visit). The storm would have been on its way by then, and Kate and her family would most likely have fled the town.

## Max Caulfield 
*Max is a true heroine, during the events of Life is Strange, she undergoes the classic {{Wiki|Hero's journey}}. Further, alluding to the hero thematic there is the nicknaming by Chloe; most of the names she calls Max are allusions to super heroes, classical heroes or even literary heroes. Also, if Max is able to save Kate, several people, including Chloe, will call her the "Blackwell Hero". There is also the obvious fact, that when Max decides to participate, she will win the Everyday Heroes Photo Contest.
