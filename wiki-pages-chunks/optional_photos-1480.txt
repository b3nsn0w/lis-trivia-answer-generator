Her optional photos section in her [Max's Journal](journal_.md) at the beginning of each [:Category:Episodes (Life is Strange)](episode.md) will initially have only single color sketch pictures which will gradually be replaced by full color photos as Max takes each optional photo. Some optional photos are only available after certain actions. Every episode contains the opportunity to take 10 photos and each awards the player an [Achievements (Life is Strange)](achievements.md) with an extra one after taking all photos in an episode, 55 achievements can be earned that way in total. All achievements are referring to photography terms.
