Here is a section of the wiki page for Mark Jefferson:

## Students 
* [Victoria Chase](victoria_chase.md) - Victoria very much had a crush on Jefferson which he seemed to be aware of but completely ignored her at anytime she tried to make advances on him. He revealed to Max that he saw her as a spoiled brat and will decide to kill her if you warned Victoria about Nathan. Despite all of this, Jefferson still gave his time and dedication to Victoria as a teacher to help her with her artwork.
* [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) - From the beginning of Episode 1, Jefferson saw Max as "special". Why he saw her as unique and having a "gift" compared to any other student is never really revealed but it's possible that he saw her as the most innocent out of the bunch. From that point onwards, he tried to passively persuade her to enter her photo for the Everyday Heroes contest so they could go to San Francisco together, most likely to lure her into his Dark Room. Having her captured in the Dark Room, he praises her innocence and beauty and explains that he always was impressed by her perfect self-image. At least from this point on, it became clear that Jefferson had a sick obsession with Max. Max was very much inspired by Jefferson's work, so much so that she applied to Blackwell Academy specifically for Jefferson's art course. He was certainly a very influential figure in her life and she had a large amount of respect for him. She admired him and never dared to suspect him throughout the game; until she finally found out about his true nature as a sick and manipulative psychopath who uses art and passion to seduce people, after Jefferson mercilessly killed her best friend, Chloe, kidnapped her to take photos of her, and later even tried to get rid of Max herself.
* [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md) - Kate was one of Jefferson's past victims, he saw her as pure and sweet but naive. He tells Max that Kate could have been his masterpiece instead. Sometime during the semester, Kate became Jefferson's classroom assistant and it appears that she trusted him enough to some extent to go to him for help in Episode 2; but he dismisses her telling her she was overdramatizing everything, most likely to get rid of her and evidence of the Dark Room. If Max saved Kate and says Kate will outlive Jefferson, Jefferson will become annoyed and say that after he is done with Max, he will return to Kate to kill her.

## Romantic 
* [Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md) - Although it is now clear that Rachel was in love with Jefferson, and that they were in a rumored sexual relationship, it is unknown whether he reciprocated her feelings towards him or if he took advantage of her love for him to get her to pose for his photographyDuring the [Square_Enix_Extra_Life_Livestream_(November_2015)](_life_is_strange__livestream.md), the developers confirmed that Rachel was in fact in love with Jefferson and that [http://i.imgur.com/0f9UIFB.jpg the letter] to Chloe in their hideout actually referred to him.. Jefferson appeared to know about Frank and Chloe while they were totally unaware of each other's relationships with Rachel as well as Jefferson's relationship with her, which begs the interesting question if Rachel trusted Jefferson more than anyone else. Regardless, while explaining her fate to Max, Jefferson seemed hardly emotional which does imply that he never really cared about her. *(See [Rachel and Jefferson](here.md) for more information on their relationship.)*

## Symbolism 

#

## Color Symbolism 
Jefferson is heavily associated with the colors black and white, due to both his clothing and photography style. These colors have been heavily associated with death in the game, and back up theories about Jefferson being involved with the disappearance of Rachel Amber. As of Episode 4, these theories have been confirmed.

#

## Spirit Animal 
It is possible that Jefferson's spirit animal is the owl. Its appearance twice in Episode 4 could mean his association with the areas in which it is featured; the barn, which he has obviously been associated with due to the Dark Room beneath it, and the junkyard right before Jefferson appears to intercept the girls. This owl could have been foreshadowing; ideal in this particular situation considering the symbolism of the owl totem.

The owl is highly representative of wisdom and change, as well as the ability to look beyond the ordinary and take inspiration from the things most people cannot see.[http://www.spiritanimal.info/owl-spirit-animal/] This makes sense considering Jefferson's profession as a photographer; finding inspiration in the tiny details of the world creates good photos. His personal inspiration taken from the beauty of innocence, vulnerability and desperation could be symbolized with this totem. Most importantly, the most traditional symbol associated with the owl is the approach of death, creating change. This is applicable for Jefferson after his encounter with the girls, and his association with Rachel's death.
