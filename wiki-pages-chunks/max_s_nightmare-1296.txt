Here is a section of the wiki page for Max's Nightmare:

## Maze 
Upon entering the bathroom, Max finds herself in a dream-like atmosphere, with floating debris and darkened backdrops. Her outfit changes to the one she wore while in the [Zeitgeist Gallery](zeitgeist_gallery.md). With the [lighthouse](lighthouse.md) in the far off distance, she lands in a maze made up of walls with photographs from the Dark Room. Jefferson patrols the scene with a flashlight, attempting to catch her. Escaping Jefferson, she makes her way to a section with the Blackwell founder statue in the center, surrounded by gallery boards of Dark Room photos, with the voice of Ray Wells booming over loudspeakers. Max must avoid being spotted by the statue's light source, hiding behind the billboards. This leads her to a section filled with Blackwell school lockers. [Warren Graham](warren_graham.md), [Raymond Wells](principal_wells.md), [Samuel Taylor](samuel.md), [Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md) and [David Madsen](david_madsen.md) patrol the spaces between the lockers, chiding at Max, calling for her to come out, and saying negative things about her. The Blackwell campus directions sign points in three different ways, but every arrow leads to "DARK ROOM".  At one part of the locker area near Samuel's patrol spot, Max may discover Warren's locker. Upon opening the locker, Max will discover the interior of the locker is filled with pictures of Max in various swimwear. Max may take an optional photo of the interior of the locker.

Once past the patrols, Max finds herself in a nightmare version of the [American Rust Junkyard](american_rust_junkyard.md). Jefferson, Nathan and [Frank Bowers](frank_bowers.md) patrol here, looking for Max and making hurtful comments and observations. Here, Max can collect five bottles in order to line them up for an optional photo. There is also the opportunity for a [Moment of Calm (Life is Strange)](moment_of_peace.md), with a "sit" option beside the [hideout](hideout.md) Chloe and Rachel inhabited. After making her way through here, Max heads towards the bench beside the lighthouse and sits.

## Chloe's House 
While Max is sitting on the bench, it begins to snow. Max finds herself trapped in the Snow Globe sitting on the mantelpiece in the [Alternative Price Household](price_household.md) when they were kids. She oversees the scene of her younger self tearing up the photograph of her and Chloe, and again witnessing [William Price](william_price.md) leave the house. She will receive a text from William which reads:

''"Hey Max, would you say hi to Chloe and Joyce? Don't forget to remind them that you let me die."''

Max's Journal is then corrupted, the entries become violent, contorted and filled with Jefferson quotes. Max's mobile phone will receive texts from [Alternative Timeline (Life is Strange)](alternative_timeline.md) Chloe, Nathan, Rachel, Samuel and [Pompidou](pompidou.md).

Max's surroundings fade and she is transported to the Dark Room, where she is once again restrained, and is dressed in her pajamas.

## Dark Room 
As Max stated in her journal entry, the main focus of this nightmare section was Chloe Price. 
The first parts of it were perceived by Max from the conversation between Jefferson and Chloe in [Episode 4: Dark Room](episode_4_.md) which has turned into Max's insecurities since this nightmare includes Chloe talking with other people flirtatiously, calling Max names; other people catching Chloe's attention rather than Max which shows Max's fear of feeling inadequate for Chloe.

This part of the nightmare starts with Max sitting restrained to the chair, she witnesses many weird character dialogues. First, Chloe and Jefferson talk about modeling. Jefferson compliments Chloe and they both say insulting things about Max, including everyone at Blackwell being over Max. Chloe and Warren then discuss being into each other rather than Max, and they kiss. The next scene is about Nathan and Chloe, Nathan calls Chloe sexy, asks why she hangs out with Max and they arrange to party and do drugs with each other. Chloe then dances in her underwear on the sofa for Max. Victoria appears; Chloe flirts with her, calling her a real woman, not a little girl like Max. Victoria says Chloe is hot and they start making out with each other. Then Chloe appears in her paraplegic state, and insults Max further. Chloe, healthy again, then takes pictures of Max, wishing she had never returned to [Arcadia Bay](arcadia_bay.md). A flash of the camera transports Max to a new location.

## Two Whales Diner 
In the [Two Whales Diner](diner.md) bathroom, Max attempts to unlock a coded door. If she fails, the room becomes crowded with graffiti of numbers. The correct code appears in the mirror, which only reflects a single code, which is Chloe's birthday. Max's outfit is the one she wore in the "Dark Room". Max leaves the bathroom to find the diner filled with the town's residents. Each one of them remarks on how bad a job she's doing, and begs her to save them. Max makes her way to the same booth from earlier in the game to talk to the only animated character there: herself.

This is one of the "Maxes she's left behind" who insults her, making it clear that she hasn't used her rewind powers for good. This "other Max" looks identical to Max from [Episode 2: Out of Time](episode_2.md). Chloe enters, and defends Max for the first time during the nightmare. It is possible that this is reality sinking through, as Chloe encourages the real Max outside of the nightmare. A flash later, and Max finds herself in a dark space highlighted by the key moments in the week shared between her and Chloe.
