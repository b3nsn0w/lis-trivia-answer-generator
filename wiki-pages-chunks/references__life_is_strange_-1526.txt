Here is a section of the wiki page for References (Life is Strange):

## Blackwell at Night 
* When talking to Chloe about Chaos Theory, Max says "I don't see any control over this chaos", another reference to the film *Get Smart*.
* During Chloe's attempt to break into Principal Wells's office, she refers to Max as "Lupin". The character {{Wiki|Ars%C3%A8ne_Lupin|Arsène Lupin III}} of the anime *Lupin III* is famous and notorious thief created by noted manga artist Kazuhiko Katō.
* During her phone call with Warren, Max advises him to "Bubble Hearth", a *{{Wiki|World of Warcraft}} *term that refers to the combination of Divine Shield and Hearthstone which allowed Paladins to transport to escape PVP or general combat. Max also texts him back with "kek" in Episode 1, meaning "Lol" in Orcish.
* The James Bond references return when Warren calls Max "007" in his instructions on how to make the pipe bomb.
* In the Principal's secretary office, Max spots a red cap which she comments with, "Only a total phony would wear a crappy hat like that." This is another reference to Haulden Caulfield from *Catcher in the Rye, *who wears the same kind of hat and calls others "phoney".
* If you rewind time after using the vending machine and use it again while searching through Blackwell at night, Max will make a comment about how she could get every can in the machine with just one coin, with a little {{Wiki|Star Wars}} pun shortly after; "But don't go to the darkside, young Max."
* In the science lab, there is an optional photo opportunity at the skeleton with a cigarette, which may be a tribute to the work *{{Wiki|Skull of a Skeleton with Burning Cigarette}}* by Vincent van Gogh.
* In the science lab, Max uses a variation of {{Wiki|Leonard McCoy}}'s "I'm a doctor, not a..." catchphrase in *{{Wiki|Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series|Star Trek}}* when searching for weed killer.
* When Max buys a drink at the vending machine at school, she says, "Release the kra-can!", in reference to the "[http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/release-the-kraken Release The Kraken!]" meme.
* In Principal Wells's office, when taking the fifth optional photograph for this episode, Max and Chloe quote {{Wiki|Tony Montana}} of *{{Wiki|Scarface_(1983_film)|Scarface}}*: "Say hello to my little friend!" - "Say goodnight to the bad guy!"
* If the player decides to take the money from the handicapped fund in Principal Wells's office, Max mentions making a trip to the {{Wiki|Powell's Books}} located in [Portland](portland.md), Oregon.
* After finding selfies of Victoria in her dressing room locker, Max says, "So Victoria's secret is... selfies", a joke again referencing to America's largest lingerie retailer, ''{{Wiki|Victoria's Secret}}*.
*One of the locker room graffiti tags reads "Rachel Abides", which might be a reference to 1998 film *The Big Lebowski*.
* In the boys bathroom the message "Dana needs a baby daddy" features a Me Gusta meme face.
* In the boys locker room a jacket can be found, which closely resembles the one the protagonist of the 2012 video game *Hotline Miami* wears.
*When Max dive-bombs into the swimming pool, she yells "Cowabunga!", a reference to the cartoon series *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles*.
* In the [Blackwell Swimming Pool](blackwell_pool.md), Chloe and Max make several references to the 1975 shark attack thriller *Jaws'', directed by {{Wiki|Steven Spielberg}}.
**If Max examines a toy shark on the side of the pool, she'll state "Just when I thought it was safe to go back in the water...", a reference to *Jaws 2*.
**When both Max and Chloe are in the pool, Chloe will tease Max by humming the shark's leitmotif. Max gets upset, claiming to still be terrified by the movie.

## Chloe's House 
* In the Arcadia Bay Police Department's website for missing persons on Chloe's computer, there are two major novel references. One of the persons listed missing in Arcadia Bay is a man named Elton Kesey. {{Wiki|Ken Kesey}} is an American novelist best known for his 1962 novel ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest''. Another, Winston Smith, was listed missing since "6/08/1984". George Orwell's novel, *Nineteen Eighty-Four*, was published June 8, 1949.
*According to David's file on her, Max uses the online aliases Mad Max, Max Factor, and Noir Angel.
*On Chloe's desk, Max can see a book "Mystic weather — supernatural sciences" by Doctor J. Karswell. It is likely a reference to the character Dr. Julian Karswell in the 1957 British horror movie *Night of the Demon.* The movie sets up a familiar "man of reason forced to acknowledge existence of the supernatural" story. Furthermore, the movie was directed by Jacques Tourneur, a French director.

## Two Whales Diner 
*Outside the dinner, near the fisherman [Media:Weeter.jpg](a_sign.md) can be seen on which "follow us on Weeter" is written. Weeter could be a reference to the social media platform {{Wiki|Twitter}}.
*If you look at the News Interview on the TV at the Two Whales Diner, the doctor's name is "Doctor Hedorah", a possible reference to the Smog Monster from the 11th *Godzilla* series movie, *Godzilla vs Hedorah*.
*The cool-looking 18 wheeler truck in front of the diner is called a Needham 1977. This is a reference to *Smokey and the Bandit*, a 1977 film that was directed by Hal Needham, an actor, writer, director, and stunt man. The film itself featured quite a bit of trucker/CB culture.
*After Max steals the RV keys from Frank and meets up with Chloe, she calls her "The Amazing SpiderMax". A reference to one of the comic book and film titles of {{Wiki|Spider-Man}}, *{{Wiki|The Amazing Spider-Man}}*.
*Chloe and Max call the bone they use to distract Frank's dog a "Scooby Snack", which is a reference to the dog from the *Scooby Doo* franchise.
* In the parking lot of the diner are again references to TV series on the license plates:
