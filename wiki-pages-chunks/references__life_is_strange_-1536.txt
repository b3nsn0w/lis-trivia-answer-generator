Here is a section of the wiki page for References (Life is Strange):

## Twin Peaks
* The plot of *{{Wiki|Twin Peaks}}* also takes place in the Pacific Northwest and is centered around the mysterious disappearance of Laura Palmer, a well-liked teenage girl, which mirrors [Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md), prior to the series start.
* Both *Life is Strange* and *Twin Peaks* work with the "quiet town with secrets" trope.
* The "[Dark Room (Location)](dark_room.md)" where Rachel was taken and the curtains separating the storage room from the actual studio as well as the red curtains Max crosses when entering the Vortex Club party are references to the Black Lodge from *Twin Peaks*.
* The implication that Jefferson is shifting his attention to [Victoria Chase](victoria_chase.md), who wins the [Everyday Heroes Photo Contest](everyday_heroes_photo_contest.md), is similar to how the *Twin Peaks* villain kidnapped the winner of the Miss Twin Peaks pageant, which is in any case, a parallel to the Everyday Heroes Photo Contest.
* In the Dark Room, a letter to Sean Prescott addressing Nathan's mental health is signed by a [Dr. Jacoby](dr__jacoby.md), which is the name of a psychiatrist in *Twin Peaks*.
* Mark Jefferson states that his orchestration of the Dark Room crimes stems from an obsession to capture the loss of innocence and youth. BOB and the other spirits of the Black Lodge in *Twin Peaks* feed on 'garmonbozia', a physical representation of pain and suffering, which they must torment people to create.
* The Double R Diner could be the inspiration for the Two Whales Diner.
* In the bathroom in the [Two Whales Diner](two_whales_diner.md), "fire walk with me" is written, a reference to the movie *Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me*, the prequel to the original series.
* The [Diner Cop](police_officer.md) is similar to the character Dale Cooper from the series, who also very consistently praised pies from the local café. In the game, the officer praises [Joyce Price](joyce_price.md)'s pumpkin pies at the Two Whales Diner.
* [File:Deputy Andy Brennan Twin Peaks - Officer Anderson Berry.jpg](thumb.md) [Anderson Berry](officer_anderson_berry.md) appears to be modeled after deputy [w:c:twinpeaks:Andy Brennan](andy_nbsp_brennan.md) from *Twin Peaks*. Apart from general similar looks, they share the same first name (Anderson, shortened to Andy) and even the prominent mole on the exact same spot, on the right, slightly above the mouth.
* The white horse in *Twin Peaks* which is featured in scenes with Laura Palmer is a mirror of the doe that appears in reference to Rachel Amber.
* Chloe's car license plate is TWNPKS (Twin Peaks).
* Laura Palmer and Rachel Amber share the same birthday, July 22nd.
* If Max tells David about Chloe's murder in Episode 5, he shoots and kills Jefferson. Twin Peaks has a similar situation with Leland Palmer smothering Jacques Renault, whom he thought responsible for his daughter's murder.
* In the [Max's Nightmare](nightmare_sequence.md) before the final decision, there are three very Black Lodge-esque moments: The presence of Doppelgängers of Max's friends and acquaintances which torture her psychologically, a throwback to the academy hallway at the start of Episode 1 where all the dialogue and hover text is backwards, and a seemingly endless cycle when Max goes through the doors of her dorm's corridor only to find she is back in the same place she started from (unless she manages to go through the right doors). Regarding the latter, this seemingly endless cycle happened with Agent Cooper when he walked through the curtains from waiting room to waiting room (a.k.a. the red room). Each room looked the same, but sometimes little things changed or appeared.
* [Samuel Taylor](samuel_taylor.md)'s character may be an analog to the character of the Log Lady in *{{wiki|Twin Peaks}}* - a TV show that [Michel Koch](michel_koch.md) says is his top favorite.[https://youtu.be/7DGgxSbRWio?t# 840 Gamespot interview E3 2015]. Similarly to the Log Lady, Samuel is seen as a strange, creepy or quirky character and has a seemingly supernatural connection to the town with an uncanny insight into its mysteries.
* Rachel Amber was secretly seeing a male (Jefferson). In Twin Peaks, inside Laura Palmer's nonsecret diary (the one the police first obtain), she wrote, "Nervous about meeting J tonight." A plastic letter "J" was also found in Laura’s stomach during forensic examination.
* Rachel Amber was thought of as a model student, with hardly anyone knowing she was involved with drugs or even a drug dealer. However, there were a few who knew about her wilder side or at least heard rumors. Nathan Prescott (who was known to run drugs in the school to other students) said Rachel "partied like a fiend on her own." In Twin Peaks, inside Laura Palmer's nonsecret diary was an envelope containing traces of cocaine. This surprised the local Sheriff who did not think of her as a drug user. One of the men she was seeing, Leo Johnson, describes her as a "wild girl." Even Laura's psychiatrist, Dr. Jacoby, stated "she was living a double life." Another older man states that Laura always got her way, yet many people in town thought she was perfect.
* Rachel's suspicious behavior was reported by Blackwell's head of security, and she was found with pharmaceuticals on campus. In Twin Peaks, drugs were being sold at the school, and it is believed Laura Palmer was one of the students being given drugs there.
* Rachel Amber was keeping things from even her closest female friend, Chloe Price. In the
