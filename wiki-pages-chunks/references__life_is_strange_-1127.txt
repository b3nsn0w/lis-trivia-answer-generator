Here is a section of the wiki page for References (Life is Strange):

Hurley, a boy she has been seeing: "You don't even know me. There are things about me... Even Donna doesn’t know me." (Donna being her best friend).
* According to a crumpled-up letter found in the junkyard, Rachel wrote that she is obsessed with a guy who is "wise and unconventional" and "kind of scary, not in a 'bad boy' way." This turns out to be Mr. Jefferson, who is a mature male in a position of authority who should know better than to get involved with a student. In Twin Peaks, Laura Palmer teases and confides her dark secrets to her psychiatrist, Dr. Jacoby - another mature man in a position of authority who should know better than to get intimately involved with a patient.
* The video footage of Laura Palmer dancing with her best friend, taken by somebody else, is similar to the photo of Rachel and Chloe who appear to be dancing, also taken by somebody else.
* Rachel Amber wears a Native-American-inspired turquoise feather earring in one ear only. In Twin Peaks, a Native-American police deputy wears a turquoise earring in one ear only and the same ear throughout the majority of Seasons 1 and 2.
* Sean Prescott and his development plans for Arcadia Bay may have been inspired by the head of the Horne family who is a rich property developer in town, who schemes to take over the local saw mill to knock it down for redevelopment. The saw mill is an important source of economy to the Twin Peaks town folk, just like how the fishing industry is important to Arcadia Bay yet has been threatened by Prescott activity in the area.
* Frank was rumored to have taken a blood oath with Rachel. Two characters in Twin Peaks of the opposite sex also took a blood oath.
* Jefferson is wearing white surgical gloves when he drugs Max. The main villain and killer of Laura Palmer puts on white surgical gloves upon drugging his wife.
* Max meets what could be her shadow self in the diner during her nightmare - a doppelgänger. She has to stand up to this "shadow self" who attempts to make her see a darker, selfish side to herself. In Twin Peaks, the Native-American police deputy describes the Black Lodge as a place where every spirit must pass through on a way to perfection. It is there that you meet your shadow self: "The Dweller on the Threshold." The deputy goes on to say that "if you confront the Black Lodge with imperfect courage, it will utterly annihilate your soul."
* When Max meets her doppelgänger in the diner of her nightmare, it raises the question as to whether the doppelgänger knows the real truth behind her nature or whether it is trying to send a darker, more selfish version of Max back to the real world. In Twin Peaks, Agent Cooper finds he has a doppelgänger in the waiting room (red room). He becomes possessed by this evil entity, and his good soul is trapped while his bad double goes back to reality.
* There is a fan theory that Max is trapped in purgatory and that the point where she wakes up in the forest at the start of the game is an endless cycle. This is also the area where she later has to make a choice between two paths. In Twin Peaks, Major Briggs states that "fear and love open the doors" to the two different lodges: fear for the Black Lodge, and love for the White Lodge. The forest in Twin Peaks is where the two worlds meet.
* Deer feature prominently in Life is Strange as a spirit animal. In the world of Twin Peaks, it is said that "gentle fawns gamboled [in the White Lodge] amidst happy, laughing spirits."
* There is a truck driver in Life is Strange who refers to Rachel Amber as a gold digger, which suggests she may have tried to use him in exchange for something she wants (whether this is likely to be a ride to L.A. or something else). In Twin Peaks, it is revealed that Laura Palmer gives sex to a truck driver in exchange for cocaine.
* Chloe Price described Rachel as her angel. Angels appear in *Fire Walk With Me* both in the form of a painting and people. In *The Missing Pieces* (a movie-length collection of missing scenes from *Fire Walk With Me*), a scene with Doc Hayward shows him reading a secret message for Laura: "The angels will return, and when you see the one that is meant to help you, you will weep with joy."
