Here is a section of the wiki page for Rachel Amber:

## Symbolism 
Rachel had a dragon tattoo on her right calf. The symbol of the dragon is connected with fame, reputation and career as well as strength and power, which is all applicable to Rachel's personality and background. The dragon symbol also embodies desire and sexual passion. Furthermore, dragons in the Orient are associated with wisdom, longevity, and regeneration, which refers to her academic performances and intellect, but also her persistence in the hearts and memories of most people in Arcadia Bay as well as her omnipresence through her Missing Person Posters all over the town. The dragon is also known to serve as a powerful guardian and guide, which refers to the role Rachel played in Chloe's life, but also the guidance Rachel indirectly provides for Max throughout the game. Dragons are messengers of balance and magic, encouraging us to see the world through the eyes of mystery and wonder, and they also are the embodiment of primordial power.http://www.whats-your-sign.com/dragon-totem.htmlhttp://www.livingartsoriginals.com/meaning-dragon.html

## Theories 
{{Main|Theories and Speculations (Life is Strange)}}
**Note: These are theories developed prior to the release of Episode 5: Polarized.**
* There were many fan theories about Rachel and her whereabouts. Some even suggested that Rachel Amber was Max from an alternative timeline.
* One theory was also that Rachel wasn't actually dead, but rather working together with Jefferson, as it was rumored they had slept with each other and both had their affections for photography and modeling which could have hooked them up.
** In that case, it was assumed that the supposedly dead body of Rachel Amber that is buried on the junkyard could be a deer instead since there is a ghost of a deer that's always there.
* Another theory is that the Doe that disappears at the end of Episode 4 is the spirit of Rachel that moves on once her body is found by Max and Chloe. This theory has later been confirmed by the developers.
* Some fans have speculated that the storm is Rachel Amber's wrath for the injustice that was done to her and also later to Chloe when she was shot in the bathroom at Blackwell Academy. Given that Max has powers herself, the possibility is there when Chloe says, "this storm could be Rachelâ€™s Revenge... Our revenge..."

## Inconsistencies 
{{Main|Inconsistencies (Life is Strange)}}
* Rachel's Missing Person Posters state that Rachel was 19, while her Blackwell Student Record originally stated that she was 18, born July 22, 1995. However, this contradiction was corrected with a patch update on January 19, 2016, which changed her year of birth to 1994.

## Character Concept and Design 
Rachel appears to be based on [w:c:twinpeaks:Laura Palmer](laura_palmer.md), a well-liked teenage girl whose murder sparked the events of the television series *[w:c:twinpeaks:Twin Peaks](twin_peaks.md)*, which *Life is Strange* has numerous references to.If you want to see a list of *Twin Peaks* references and influences, see *[References (Life is Strange)#Twin Peaks](here.md)*. Rachel shares her birthday (July 22) with Laura Palmer.

There has been a lot of speculation and theorizing about whether or not Rachel really died. In an interview however Co-Director and Writer [Michel Koch](michel_koch.md) confirmed her death as an important part of the narrative:

{{Bigquote|"It's quite hard, quite dark, the way you discover her, but that's something we also wanted to push, because... it's like some times in real life, when you have someone that's been missing for months. Most of the time, the reality is, that person is dead. We knew for a lot of players, there was this fantasy of finding her alive or that she was a time traveler or she was something else. But for us, Life is Strange is not a fantasy game, even if there are sci-fi elements."[http://www.shacknews.com/article/92865/life-is-strange-co-director-discusses-the-games-endings-production-and-answers-chatty-questions Life is Strange co-director discusses the game's endings, production, and answers Chatty questions] (January 22, 2016)}}
