**Chloe:** What are you talking about?

**Max:** There are cameras all over the house. I saw it on a monitor in the garage.

**Chloe:** I knew it! He is so hella fucking paranoid. I'll keep this a secret for now...

**Max:** Sometimes ignorance is bliss.

**Chloe:** He's an elite asshole who sells bad shit cut with laxative...and he dosed me with some drug in his room.

**Max:** What?

**Chloe:** I met him in some shithole bar that didn't card me. He was too rich for the place and too wasted. And he kept flashing bills...

**Max:** Just tell me what happened, Chloe. Now.

**Chloe:** I was an idiot. I thought he was so blazed it would be an easy score.

**Max:** You needed money that bad?

**Chloe:** Actually, yes. I owe big time. And I thought I'd have enough for me and Rachel if she showed up...

**Chloe:** Three grand plus interest. And before I could get a chunk of that from Nathan...he dosed my drink with some shit...

**Max:** God, Chloe, I can't believe this... I mean, I do. Then what?

**Chloe:** I know I passed out on the floor. I woke up and that perv was smiling, crawling towards me with a camera...

**Max:** Go on...

**Chloe:** Everything was a blur... I tried to kick him in the balls and broke a lamp. Nathan freaked, so I managed to bum rush the door and get the hell out. Max, it was insane.
