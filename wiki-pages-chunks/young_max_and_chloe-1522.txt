Here is a section of the wiki page for Young Max and Chloe:

## Chloe # 
Chloe is extremely sentimental and reluctant to throw things away. When Max gives logical reasons for getting rid of old things from Chloe's room, Chloe will attach a fond memory to justify keeping them, even if they are from phases she has grown out of or have missing pieces. Most of the items she refuses to throw away remind her of the times she used them with Max. The fact that she hangs onto memories may be one reason why Max thinks Chloe has a "killer memory."
Chloe still keeps her old school supplies and her textbooks for Science, Chemistry, English, and Math, which Max thinks she is "such a nerd" for doing but thinks that Chloe must get her sentimentality from her parents, who still haven't parted with Chloe's crib.
Another example of Chloe's sentimentality is when she used to own a goldfish called Calico Jack.John Rackham, an English pirate captain in the early 18th century, went by the name Calico Jack. She refused to get another goldfish after having to flush him, so the fish tank has been stored in the attic ever since. This suggests that Chloe is reluctant to replace the things she has lost. Max knows she took [Bongo](bongo.md)'s death hard.

Chloe also has a sensitive and self-conscious side. This is evident when she throws away her favorite hoodie due to a fear of judgement from the students at her new school, [Blackwell Academy](blackwell_academy.md). The well-worn burgundy colored hoodie with a Griffin design on the front has accumulated many holes over the years she has worn it, and Max notes that these holes never stopped Chloe from wearing it before, but Chloe doesn't seem to be bonding well with her new peers, describing them as "fake people" and Max as "real."

With regards to her friendship with Max, Chloe is loyal and protective. When Max slipped and accidentally broke one of the stair posts in Chloe's house a few years prior to 2008, Chloe took the blame for her and never changed her story even when she got grounded. Max truly appreciates what Chloe did for her back then. She is reluctant to tell Max about her issues with the students at her new school and only discloses her issues when Max presses the subject. This suggests that Chloe may be prone to bottling up her feelings or is perhaps reluctant to burden her best friend.

Chloe is mischievous and likes to bend rules. An example of this is when [Joyce Price](her_mom.md) had told her to get rid of old and unwanted items from her room, so she turned this into a game where she blew a couple of dolls up. When Max questions this, she tells Max that her mom never specified *how* she should dispose of her things. 
She also drew sharpie boobs on the boy band trading cards they collected together, and Max was so mad at her for doing this.

Chloe is creative and has a great imagination, as seen by the drawings of cool inventions that she placed inside a [Time Capsule](time_capsule.md), and Max thinks that Chloe has always been good at making up cool things to do. She loved Scratch Art when she was younger - at least around the time she had placed a Scratch Art pad in the time capsule. This is a drawing technique where a dark layer is scratched away - usually by a wooden stylus - to reveal a different color or multiple colors underneath. She also made Christmas decorations when she was 5 years old which embarrass her, but Max thinks they are cute.

Max describes Chloe as a nature nerd when she discovers that Chloe's parents have secretly bought plane tickets to take Chloe to see the {{wiki|Grand Canyon}} in Arizona. This suggests she enjoys nature. However, when it comes to animals, Max comments that Chloe always preferred imaginary animals to real ones.Max: "Chloe's always prefered imaginary animals to real ones. Besides Bongo, of course." ([Farewell](farewell.md) - Chloe's bedroom, Chloe's house.)

There appears to be an oceanic theme with Chloe's plush toys. At age 14, she still owns a plush toy called [Mr. Sharkie](mr__sharkie.md), which she describes as her beloved childhood friend and is unwilling to part with it. She also has a plush toy called [Billy The Squid](billy_the_squid.md), which she forgot about due to placing him inside a time capsule that she buried in her back yard with Max back in 2003. The oceanic theme could be linked to her interest in pirates. Even at age 14, she never really grew out of wanting to be a pirate.

In terms of reading interests, Chloe owns the {{wiki|Complete_Works_of_Shakespeare|Complete Works of William Shakespeare}}, so she seems to have an interest in classic plays. She is also a {{wiki|Manga}} nerd. Max comments that this might be the one thing where Chloe out-nerds her.

Even though Chloe has a geeky side, and even though she owns a games console which both girls play on, she has been reluctant to try an {{wiki|Massively_multiplayer_online_game|MMO game}}. Max wonders if her move to [Seattle](seattle.md) would finally convince Chloe to try one.

## Mutual Influence # 
There are a couple of things that suggest Max and Chloe easily distract each other, such as the time when [Ms. Shelley](ms__shelley.md), their {{wiki|Social Studies}} teacher, praises Chloe on her work but urges her to pay attention in class instead of drawing pictures with "Maxine." (It appears they were working on their treasure map in this class.) Another example is the {{wiki|Choose Your Own Adventure}} book they created called [Media:Note_AdventureBookCover.png](_max_and_chloe_s_sewer_adventure__.md) Although their efforts on this were praised by [Mrs. Anders](mrs__anders.md), she urged them to please do the book report they were assigned next time. This suggests they enjoyed being creative together and doing what they wanted to do rather than sticking to tasks they were assigned.

## Education 
They both attended [Arcadia Bay Junior High](arcadia_bay_junior_high.md), and the first class they had together was United States Social Studies. 
Even though Max didn't get grades as good as Chloe in 8th grade (ages 13/14), she did better than Chloe at PE. In 8th grade, Chloe studied: Earth Science, English, World History, Pre-Algebra, Spanish 1, Phys Ed.

Chloe was accepted for admission at Blackwell Academy in September 2008. She was one of approximately 100 students who were selected out of 1200 applicants. She was selected due to excelling in all criteria for admission. However, not long after she started at Blackwell Academy, the principal has called for a meeting with her parents in an effort to try and assist Chloe in improving her behavior. Chloe was not getting on well with a girl called [Marisa Rogers](marisa_rogers.md).
