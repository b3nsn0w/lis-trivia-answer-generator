## Inconsistencies 
{{Main|Inconsistencies (Life is Strange)}}
* Victoria's birthday is listed as **August 14, 1995,** on her Blackwell Student Record (which makes her **18** during the events of the game), while her social media page says that it's **November 14, 1995** (which makes her **17**). A lot speaks for trusting in the school record rather than Victoria's social media since it is an official document featuring her parents' signature; still, it is unclear why Victoria wouldn't use her real birth date on social media. Victoria mentions her age again in the Dark Room in Episode 5; if you successfully warned her before, she says: "I don't want to die like this! I'm only **18**!"
