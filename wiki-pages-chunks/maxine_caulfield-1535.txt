Here is a section of the wiki page for Maxine Caulfield:

## Spirit Animal
Max is heavily associated with the [Doe](doe.md). This is symbolic of kindness and compassion, as well as being intuitive, quick-thinking and resourceful; all aspects of Max's personality.Check out this article for more information:

Max wears her Jane-Doe shirt in "Chrysalis", and another shirt with a Doe design in "Out of Time". The Doe spirit animal image follows and guides her to the lighthouse and is prominent in her visions, as well as appearing to her in the junkyard with Chloe. The Doe can also be spotted as an image in the bathroom of the Two Whales Diner, and during Episode 4 upon the discovery of Rachel's body. Max has a conversation with Samuel about spirit animals, in which he confirms that she's right about the Doe being her spiritual guide. It would make sense that the Doe would lead her to safety, as well as guide her to Rachel's body. The Doe guided her through her vision of the storm to the lighthouse, and in Episode 5, it became apparent that the lighthouse was actually the only safe place for Max and Chloe during the storm. Additionally, if Max chose to sacrifice Chloe, at her funeral Max can be seen wearing a doe necklace. Another fact that lends more support to this theory is that the doe is immune to Max's rewind power. If she chose to sacrifice the town, three does which are now freed can be seen standing among the ruins in the ending cutscene.

## Symbolism
Color symbolism is prominent in the game, linking characters together.

Blue is a key color in the game; Max wears the same color wristband as Chloe's hair and nail polish, the [Blue Butterfly](blue_butterfly.md), the blue-jay, Kate's marker, Alyssa's nail polish, and Joyce's hair clip. Max's 13-year-old self also wears a shirt of a similar blue shade. There is much debate among fans about the meaning of this color, but it is known to be associated with hopefulness for the future, as well as vulnerability. These meanings make sense when applied to the characters associated with the color.

Max's clothing and the motifs on her shirts change with the atmosphere of the game.

The colors black and white are heavily associated with death in the game; in the fourth episode, Max wears a black shirt for the first time, which is hugely symbolic of the many deaths in the episode. This shirt also features the {{Wiki|Death's-head Hawkmoth}}, made popular by the film *{{Wiki|Silence of the Lambs}}*. This symbol emphasizes the importance of death in the episode.

The dreamcatcher that Max wears in Episode 5 in the reality where she won the Everyday Heroes Contest represents becoming an artist and her artwork being displayed in a gallery being her biggest dream and passion. The dream catcher is supposed to be able to trap bad dreams in its web; only good dreams are allowed to filter through a small opening in the center of the circle - like Max is able to forget all the bad experiences she went through for a few moments in that reality; everything seems quite perfect in that scene, all that horror she went through far away. It's actually the most perfect outcome for all characters Max could've created in that week (with herself winning the Photo Contest, Nathan and Jefferson captured and brought to justice, David as the big hero, Nathan, Victoria, and Kate still alive, and Chloe full of hope, planning to attend school again). It could also represent her wish to get over everything she's experienced over the week.Symbolism of Dream Catchers: http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/STUDENTS/GREENB/crafts1.html{{Wiki|Dreamcatcher|Wikipedia}}: "The Ojibwe believe that a dreamcatcher changes a person's dreams. According to Konrad J. Kaweczynski, "Only good dreams would be allowed to filter through... Bad dreams would stay in the net, disappearing with the light of day." Good dreams would pass through and slide down the feathers to the sleeper."

## Theories
it seems that max might have incorrectly mistaken that she creates another reality/timeline when she transfers her consciousness into the past, however this is proven not to be true and instead she alters the timeline of her reality from past, present and to the future. Which means that max changes her own realities timeline instead of creating another reality/timeline.

At a given time Max can use her laptop for research about her power, after opening a page about wormholes, she will comment on how that theory makes sense. considering that max can manipulate & control time, max may be able to open/create a wormhole in Space & Time to time travel to the past and or future, creating another timeline/reality in the process. However max can only open a wormhole in space and time not just in space meaning that she can only use her wormholes for only time travel purposes instead of just teleportation. 

There is also a theory that if Max holds a person's hand and or touches them (specifically skin to skin contact) while manipulating time, they became immune to some of her Time manipulation abilities like her.
