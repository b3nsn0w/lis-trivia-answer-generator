The content can reveal information about characters, locations, or possible alternate sequences and endings planned pre- or during development by [Don't Nod](don_t_nod.md).

## Unused Audio

## Names 
*At some point in the game's development, [Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md) was going to be called Jessie. The file name for the photo of Chloe and Rachel found under Chloe's bed in Chrysalis is *"TX_Papers_PictureChloeJessie01_D"*. The postcard from Rachel is named in a similar fashion: *"TX_Papers_PostcardJessie01_D"*.
* In an early stage of the game's development, [Brooke Scott](brooke_scott.md) was going to be called Hayley. References to this name can still be found in the game files; an animation sequence of Brooke flying her drone in "[Episode 1: Chrysalis](chrysalis.md)" is named "*AS_E1_3A_CampusA_Hayley*".
*Although Trevor's surname was never mentioned in the game, a surname of "Johnson" exists for him in [DONTNOD](dontnod.md)'s original files, as confirmed by Square Enix's *Life is Strange* [Community Management](community_manager.md), Toby Palm.

## Design 
*[File:Edouard-caplain-principal-hd.jpg](306x306px.md) A concept art by [Edouard Caplain](edouard_caplain.md) implies that in an early stage of development, Principal Wells' ethnicity/skin color was not decided yet. Designs for both a white and black skinned Wells exist. He is the one of two characters which concept art versions of different ethnicities exist for. The other being [Evan Harris](evan_harris.md).

* At some point in the game's development, Alyssa was going to have blue hair. In one of the photos of [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md) taken by [David Madsen](david_madsen.md), Alyssa can be seen with blue hair. Concept art from the [Limited Edition (Life is Strange)](limited_edition.md) also displays her that way.
