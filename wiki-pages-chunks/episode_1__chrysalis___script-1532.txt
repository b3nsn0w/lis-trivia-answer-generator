## **Conversation with Warren** # 

**Warren:'* What up, Max? How are you?

*Warren tries to hug Max, but she pulls out the flash drive and hands it to him instead.''

**Max:** Here's your flash. Thanks.

**Warren:** No problem. Check out my new wheels... *(gestures to car behind him)*

**Max:** Cool. Very old school.

**Warren:** 1978, to be exact. Now we can go to the drive-in. There's one in Newberg, just sixty miles away.

**Max:** You're in the wrong time, Warren. But then, so am I...

**Warren:** You okay?

**Max:** It's been one strange fucking day.

(Made fun of Victoria)(Made fun of Victoria)

**Warren:** Man, I saw that Victoria didn't take down that pic of you on Facebook... Major bitch move.

{{#tag:tabber|No worries.# No worries.

**Max:** No worries, Warren. I took a sweet shot of Victoria I can't wait to share...

**Warren:** Oh, score one for Team Max! It will be so karmic to see her ass clown face all over the interwebs...

**Max:** I guess she does deserve it for all the shitty things she's done to people here.

{{!}}-{{!}}I don't want to talk.I don't want to talk.

**Max:** I don't want to talk about it.

**Warren:** Geez, you're Little Miss Sensitive today...

**Max:** I wouldn't push your luck, Warren. Not in the mood today.

|-|(Comforted Victoria)# (Comforted Victoria)

**Warren:** I bet. I heard Victoria got a faceful of paint... I'd pay money to see a photo of that...

{{#tag:tabber|Really?Really?

**Max:** Really? I wish I would have known...

**Warren:** You probably could have raised a Kickstarter fund just for that one image of her covered in paint.

**Max:** Had I known that... Anyway, Victoria took down my photo. So that drama ended well.

{{!}}-{{!}}I don't want to talk.# I don't want to talk.

**Max:** I don't want to talk about it.

**Warren:** Geez, you're Little Miss Sensitive today...

**Max:** I wouldn't push your luck, Warren. Not in the mood today.

(Daniel drew Max's portrait)(Daniel drew Max's portrait)

**Warren:** By the way, I saw Daniel's sketch of you online... Not bad, but I could do a much better job.

{{#tag:tabber|Daniel posted it online?# Daniel posted it online?

**Max:** Daniel posted it online already? That was nice...

**Warren:** Congrats! You're part of his online portrait posse.

**Max:** Don't be jealous. I'm sure he'll ask you soon.

**Warren:** Oh, you're a wit, Max.

**Max:** It's the company I keep, Warren.

{{!}}-{{!}}You can draw?You can draw?

**Max:** You can draw? I thought you were Blinded By Science, not art.

**Warren:** Art IS Science. Music is math, et cetera, et cetera. I'd put Stephen Hawking against Picasso any day.

**Max:** Hardcore. So you must use a computer to draw.

**Warren:** Of course. I'd love to tweak one of your selfies with some cool graphics...

**Max:** That might not suck. I'll let you know.

**Warren:** So did you get a chance to check out the movie booty on my flash drive?

Yeah, thanks.# Yeah, thanks.

**Max:** Yeah, thanks. You had some cool shit on there, from *Akira* to *Twilight Zone*. Which seems apropos today...

**Warren:** I consider myself a pop...cultural pirate connoisseur.

**Max:** That does sound better than "thief".

|-|I've been busy.I've been busy.

**Max:** No, I've been way too busy with class...and life.

**Warren:** Damn, girl, you had it like a year.

**Max:** Or a week. I did browse through all the titles, drama queen.

**Warren:** Haha. Make sure you watch *Cannibal Holocaust*.

Seen it.# Seen it.

**Max:** Seen it. I was more disturbed by all those emo-vampire movies in there.

**Warren:** Can't a sensitive high school boy love sensitive vampires too?

|-|No fucking way.No fucking way.

**Max:** No fucking way will I watch that. My mind is twisted enough...

**Warren:** I laughed my ass off.

**Max:** So you're sensitive...

**Warren:** Ouch... That sounds awful the way you say it.

How so?# How so?

**Max:** How so?

**Warren:** Sensitive usually means "won't be having sex with you."

**Max:** Oh, god! You need a sensitive woman to kick your ass.

|-|"Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!""Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!"

**Max:** No, I was impressed you had *Faster, Pussycat. Kill! Kill!*

**Warren:** Russ Meyer was a genius of black and white. Plus, babes with breasts.

**Max:** Who would beat your sensitive ass down.

|-|Not at all.# Not at all.

**Max:** Not at all. Sensitive is good, unless you're a pushover. You have hip taste and a quick mind.

**Warren:** Thanks for noticing, Max.

**Max:** The right girl will too...

**Warren:** If I was lucky... Speaking of hip and fast, we should cruise out in my car to an actual movie this week... But you seem
