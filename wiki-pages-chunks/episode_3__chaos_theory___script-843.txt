Sounds like you know a lot more than me, child.

**Max:** I just think Arcadia Bay is in trouble...

**Homeless Lady:** Maybe you'd like to tell me what you're hidin'?

Tell the truth.Tell the truth.**Max:** I feel like I can trust you as much as Chloe...and you wouldn't think I'm crazy.

**Homeless Lady:** Too late for me to judge anybody. Plus, you're not crazy.

**Max:** I'm just gonna say this...I had a vision of Arcadia Bay being destroyed by a tornado...for real.

**Homeless Lady:** Could be. Bad mojo is in the air this week. Thanks for the warning, Max.

|-|Nothing to tell.# Nothing to tell.**Max:** There's...nothing to tell...

**Homeless Lady:** If you don't wanna share, you don't have to; I'm just an old homeless woman.

**Max:** Please let me know if you need anything.

**Homeless Lady:** A warnin'...once you decide to tell me what you know.

*Max enters the diner.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Good Lord, bacon...I'm ready to nosh again. But I need to get those keys from Frank.

# ## **Conservation with Frank** # 
(Shot at Frank)(Shot at Frank)**Frank:** You show up after almost shooting me? You have serious balls, little girl. But hanging out with Chloe, playing with guns and dressing like Rachel doesn't make you cool or tough. The fuck do you want?

|-|(Didn't shoot at Frank)# (Didn't shoot at Frank)**Frank:** You have serious balls, little girl. But hanging out with Chloe, playing with guns and dressing up like Rachel doesn't make you cool or tough. What the fuck do you want? Take a picture of me and I'll break your fucking camera.

**Max:** How do you know these are Rachel's clothes?

(Shot at Frank)(Shot at Frank)**Frank:** Because she looks beautiful in them and you look like ass. Aiming a gun doesn't make you any sexier.

|-|(Didn't shoot at Frank)# (Didn't shoot at Frank)**Frank:** Because she looks beautiful in them and you look like ass. You're lucky I just took that gun from you...

**Max:** Grab your keys and let's check out your RV...

**Frank:** Let's not. You fucking creep me out.

**Max:** *(thinking)* In other words, Max, no keys. Maybe I could chat up that officer, or even Nathan, and then go all "Groundhog Day" on them until I get the info I need...

**Frank:** I was eating those beansâ€”are you fucking insane? I WAS EATING THOSE BEANS!

*Frank angrily stands up but slips on the beans. He falls to the floor and Max laughs. Frank pounds his fist on the ground and lunges at Max. She is forced to rewind.''
