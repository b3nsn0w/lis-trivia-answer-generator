The **"Arcadia Gas"** gas station is located on the [Arcadia Bay Ave](arcadia_bay_ave.md), opposite of the [Two Whales Diner](two_whales_diner.md). It is frequented by both [Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md) and [Mark Jefferson](mark_jefferson.md) and remains unexplorable throughout the game.

##  Significance 
While examining [Investigation Files](evidence.md) in [Episode 4: Dark Room](episode_4.md), it is revealed, with some digging, that on October 4, the night [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md) got drugged, both Nathan and Mr. Jefferson were seen at the gas station within minutes of each other.
