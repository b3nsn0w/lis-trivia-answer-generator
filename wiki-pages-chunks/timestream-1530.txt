## San Francisco Timeline 
After Max is captured by Jefferson in [Episode 5: Polarized](episode_5.md), she uses [Max's Diary](her_diary.md) to travel back to [Photography Lab](jefferson_s_classroom.md). She texts [David Madsen](david_madsen.md) about Jefferson and the Dark Room and then submits her photo to the [Everyday Heroes Photo Contest](everyday_heroes_contest.md). A timestream montage is shown; some events remain the same, but others change dramatically, such as police officers infiltrating the Dark Room and later uncovering Rachel's body,Â Jefferson and Nathan being arrested, and Max winning the contest and setting off for [San Francisco](san_francisco.md).

After arriving at the [Zeitgeist Gallery](zeitgeist_gallery.md), Max discovers that the [storm](storm.md) is still in existence and approaching [Arcadia Bay](arcadia_bay.md). Determined to save Chloe, Max focuses on her gallery entry, returns to the day it was taken and tears it apart, preventing herself from winning the contest. A timestream montage shows Max putting the torn photo inside her diary, Jefferson burning Max's diary, Max restrained in the Dark Room and Jefferson entering the Dark Room.
