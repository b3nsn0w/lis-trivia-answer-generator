## Character Concept and Design
In an [https://www.polygon.com/2015/6/24/8838761/life-is-strange-season-2-new-cast interview for Polygon] in June 2015, [Michel Koch](michel_koch.md) stated that Max is "always looking to the past. She has this old camera, she's reluctant to make decisions. [[Christian Divine](_christian_divine.md)] has been writing her [in a way that] sometimes she's using some older expressions."

## Inconsistencies
{{Main|Inconsistencies (Life is Strange)}} 
*In Episode 2, at the [Two Whales Diner](two_whales_diner.md), Max eats breakfast with her fork in her left hand and her knife in her right. However, in Episode 3, when Joyce makes Max some breakfast at the [Madsen Household](madsen_household.md), Max eats breakfast with her knife and fork in opposite hands. It is either an oversight by the developers or an indication that Max is actually ambidextrous.
