*Alyssa takes a step back and falls through a hole in the floor.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* No! No!!!

''While Alyssa is still where Max finds her, Max can look around for something to use. She can find a plank of wood next to her, lift it up, and drop it at Alyssa's feet. Having done this, she runs across the plank and extends her hand.*

**Max:** Come on, Alyssa! Take my hand!

**Alyssa:** Here I come!

*They safely make it to the ground.*

**Alyssa:** You did it, Max!

**Max:** Are you okay?

**Alyssa:** Now I am! We need to get out of here!

## **Optional Conversation with Fisherman** 

*Max can walk over to the fisherman and rewind.*

**Max:** Come on, you have to get out of here right now.

**Fisherman:** I need to breathe… I… I need air…

*Max helps him up. She then uses the fuse box to put out the fire.*

**Max:** You should get out of here!

**Fisherman:** *[running away]* The whole town is dying…

**Max:** *(thinking)* Okay, I better hurry to the diner over there. I need Warren's photo.

*Max enters the Two Whales Diner through the side entrance.*

## **Diner** 

*Max enters the storeroom of the Two Whales Diner.*

**Announcer:** ...evacuation. Once again, this is not a test. This is not a test. An E6 tornado warning has been issued for Arcadia Bay and surrounding counties. The Emergency Broadcast System is now in effect...

*She opens the storeroom door and walks into the diner.*

**Warren:** Max!

**Joyce:** Max! *[hugging her]* Oh Jesus, I am so glad to see you, sweetie! Are you okay?

**Max:** Yes. What about you guys?

**Joyce:** The Two Whales is barely standing now... I don't know if it’s going to make it through this tornado. Poor Officer Berry and all those people out there...

**Max:** I know.

**Joyce:** Okay, get your ass inside... I have to get back to this gentleman on the ground... Warren has been gathering all the first aid...

**Warren:** It’s not much, Joyce. But it’s all we have.

**Max:** *[turning to Warren]* You okay, Warren?

**Warren:** How the hell did I ignore all those warnings, Max? The snow, the eclipse...

**Max:** There’s nothing you could do about it, Warren.

**Warren:** I’m so stupid... I should have seen it coming...

**Max:** *(thinking)* So glad everybody is safe here, but I need that photo from Warren to help Chloe!
