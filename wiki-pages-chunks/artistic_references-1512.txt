## [Victoria Chase](victoria.md) 
* {{Wiki|Diane Arbus}} - Victoria feels haunted by her images of sad mothers and children.

* {{Wiki|Robert Frank}} - Victoria prefers his work to that of Arbus. Jefferson agrees and believes he captured the essence of post-war, beat America.
* {{Wiki|Louis Daguerre}} - Victoria gives an answer to Jefferson's question that Daguerre was a French painter who created "Daguerreotypes" - a process she explains gave portraits "a sharp reflective style, like a mirror."
