*In the hall, Max can look to a Vortex Club "End of the World Party" poster she will remark; "I'll bet they will party like it's 1999. Assholes." This may be a reference to the famous song by {{Wiki|Prince (musician)|Prince}}, 1999 (Party like it's 1999).
* Max's Facebook header, "Time is Bunk", is a quote from {{Wiki|Douglas Adams}}'s novel, ''{{Wiki|The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy|The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy}}''.
* If Kate Marsh died, Max uses a quote from Jack Kerouac's, *The Dharma Bums*: "Are we fallen angels who didn't want to believe that nothing is nothing..." If Kate Marsh survived, Max uses the first stanza of {{Wiki|William Blake}}'s *The Tyger* from *Songs of Innocence and Experience: *"Tyger Tyger, burning bright / In the forests of the night; / What immortal hand or eye, / Could frame thy fearful symmetry?"
* If Kate Marsh died, Victoria will leave the quote, "Requiescat in pace" as a message on Kate's Facebook profile. "Requiesact in pace", literally meaning "May he or she rest in peace", is a phrase popularized by {{Wiki|Ezio Auditore da Firenze}} of Ubisoft Montreal's ''{{Wiki|Assassin's Creed}}'' series, specifically in Assassin's Creed II, Brotherhood and Revelations.

* In the Arcadia Bay cleans receipt in Victoria's rooms, the name of the employee who serviced Victoria is named "{{Wiki|Amy_Pondhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)Amelia Pond}}", a reference to the Doctor's companion from the fifth, sixth and seventh seasons of *Dr. Who*.
* When referring to little known facts about Victoria, Max begins her sentences with "Victoria's secret?" Victoria's Secret is major American retail store that was established in 1977 by Roy Raymond.
* Victoria's room contains a glow in the dark [Media:Note3-vicroom-doll.png](figurine.md) that is also an optional photo. Its packaging is located in her trash can and contains a hidden reference that is only revealed through an understanding of English and Chinese. On the front, the only completely legibleThere is a completely illegible word in Japanese hiragana at the top of the packaging. The partially illegible Japanese katakana at the bottom of the packaging, ヌー(?)コス [nu-- (?)ko-su], could mean "new (?) costume", as コス is "costume". This would make sense on the packaging of a figurine. words are: *My*, *Bluberry*, and 之夜之 is an old Japanese kanji possessive particle that the hiragana particle の now replaces in this modern day. But 之 is still used as a possessive article in Chinese. It acts as both "apostrophe s" and "of" in English. 夜 is the Chinese character that means "night". This translates to ''My Bluberry('s) Night* and is believed to be a reference to the film *{{wiki|My Blueberry Nights}}'' - a product of France and China. Perhaps a member of Dontnod's team is a fan of this film.
