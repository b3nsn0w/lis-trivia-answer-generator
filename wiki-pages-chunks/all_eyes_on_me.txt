##  Lyrics 
:Are you ready?
:Go!
:Are you ready?

:All eyes on me in the club
:See 'em all lookin' at me, feening to touch
:Top dollar lady baby tee, it's what's up
:Money, money, money, I can't even get enough
:And you know, I got my nails done, hair done, everything did
:They're uncertain 'bout my language
:Me speaks the money, the money speaks clear
:If it ain't 'bout the money, then me don't wanna hear

:Got stilettos on, pretty feet, I don't skip a beat
:Smooth skin, silky sweet, you could really eat
:All these silly boys, tellin' me silly things
:Follow me, follow me, if you want to feel elite
:I'm a top shelf bottle, expensive taste
:And this night, it goes just like this list I made
:It goes, one for the money, two for the show
:Three of us girls, and four, let's go

:One for the money, two for the show
:Three of us girls, four, let's go
:One for the money, two for the show
:Three of us girls, four, let's go
:One for the money, two for the show
:Three of us girls, four, let's go
:One for the money, two for the show
:Three of us girls, four, let's go

:All eyes on me, up in here
:Center of attention, but I keeps to the rear
:When I'm in the room, why your team disappear?
:Bad girl (RAWR), let me speak in your ear
:I'm a naughty little girl, and I give them what they need
:Hit 'em with that tight work, switchin' up the speed
:'Til the DJ stops switchin' up the beat
:Volume too low, can you get it up for me?

:Got my swag on, kill 'em, lames, don't feel 'em
:Broke dudes won't do, won't deal wit' 'em
:If I really want 'em, all I gotta do is get 'em
:And it's not even a problem, I just tell my girls to sic 'em
:I'm a top shelf bottle, expensive taste
:And this night, it goes just like this list I made
:It goes, one for the money, two for the show
:Three of us girls, and four, let's go

:One for the money, two for the show
:Three of us girls, four, let's go
:One for the money, two for the show
:Three of us girls, four, let's go
:One for the money, two for the show
:Three of us girls, four, let's go
:One for the money, two for the show
:Three of us girls, four, let's go

:It goes, one for the money, two for the show
:Three of us girls, and four, let's go

:One for the money, two for the show
:Three of us girls, four, let's go
:One for the money, two for the show
:Three of us girls, four, let's go
:One for the money, two for the show
:Three of us girls, four, let's go
:One for the money, two for the show
:Three of us girls, four, let's go
:One for the money, two for the show
:Three of us girls, four, let's go
:One for the money, two for the show
:Three of us girls, four, let's go
:One for the money, two for the show
:Three of us girls, four, let's go
:One for the money, two for the show
:Three of us girls, four, let's go
