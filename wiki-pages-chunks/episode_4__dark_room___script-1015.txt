Here is a section of the wiki page for Episode 4: Dark Room - Script:

Okay, but this is like poet karaoke, so don't cringe: "I shall be telling this with a sigh. Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I... I took the one less traveled by. And that has made all the difference."

**Max:** That was beautiful, Alyssa. And it's exactly what I needed to hear.

**Alyssa:** Thanks for not cringing. And thanks for watching my back. Blackwell would be so much cooler if we all did that for everybody else... but you're a great start, Max.

*Max automatically leaves the conversation.*

{{!}}-{{!}}Tell me later.# Tell me later.

**Max:** I wish I had time to hear it... Promise you'll tell me if... next time we meet.

**Alyssa:** That sounded ominous. But I promise. Be careful out there, Max.

*Max automatically leaves the conversation.*

}}

|-|Leave.Leave.

**Max:** No doubt, but I actually have to go now. Talk to you later, Alyssa.

# # ## **Optional Conversation with Justin**

**Justin: **Yo, "Maximum Overdrive." About time you got here to save this lame rave... Wanna get ripped?

**Max:** You look pretty ripped already, Justin. And not happy. Why did you even come tonight?

**Justin:** Where else could I go in Arcadia Bay on a Thursday night? Besides, Dana is here... just not with me. So yes, this party sucks.

Rachel.# Rachel.

**Max:** Rachel Amber won't be coming either.

**Justin:** Damn, I was thinking about Rachel and Chloe tonight... If they showed up together right now, shit would end. Rachel could always shut Victoria down.

**Max:** Good for Rachel. I wish I could have seen that...

|-|Nathan.Nathan.

**Max:** Speaking of... have you seen Nathan?

**Justin:** Oh, he should be freaking out in the VIP lounge with that Whore-tex Club. Fucking hate those snobby douchebags... especially Nathan. That dude is gonna go on a rampage soon.

**Max:** You might be right. So stay away from him tonight, okay? Spread the word.

|-|Dana.# Dana.

**Max:** You're obviously not cool with Trevor dating Dana.

**Justin:** I tried to front like I was, but when I saw them together, I came over to cry like a little bitch.

**Max:** No, it's more like somebody who's in pain. I'm sorry, Justin. But you're a cool, considerate guy and you're going to find somebody just as cool, minus the drama.

**Justin:** Max, I know I'm twisted, but your face looks so fucking intense. And your voice sounds... different. You okay? How about a quick dab?

**Max:** Uh, no. I—I'm cool, Justin. And I have to get going. Maybe you should go chill somewhere else.

**Justin:** Fucking A, Maximus! You're right. I'm only torturing myself here. Plus I'm too loaded... It's time to get my board and grind.

## **Conversation with Sarah**# 

**Max:** Excuse me, but I’m going in.

**Sarah:** Sorry, but this is the VIP section. Members only. Mmm-kay?

(Max's name is on the list)(Max's name is on the list)

**Max:** Sorry, but I’m on the list. Mmm-kay?

**Sarah:** I know that Max Caulfield is not on any list for the Vortex Club. Nice try.

|-|(Max's name isn't on the list)# (Max's name isn't on the list)

**Max:** I don’t give a shit about being a member. I just want to talk to Nathan…

**Sarah:** Victoria specifically told me not to let you in. Nice try. Too bad you're not a member.

**Max:** Listen…

**Sarah:** No, you listen. Courtney is supposed to be the VIP gatekeeper, not me. So please go.
