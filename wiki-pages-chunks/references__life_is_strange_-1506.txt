*When Max is tied to the chair in the [Dark Room (Location)](dark_room.md) and asked for help by saying, "Is there anybody out there?", it might be a reference to the song of Pink Floyd on the album "The Wall" from 1979 which has the same title.
*Max's "focus within a focus" on the selfie she took in class is a direct reference to the "remixing the remix" segment of *Remember Me*.
*Halfway through the episode, Max wakes up in a timeline where she's back in the Dark Room and cannot escape using her powers because Jefferson burned her diary and photos. This could be a reference to the climax of *The Butterfly Effect*, where the protagonist wakes up in a timeline where he's in a mental institution and cannot escape because in this timeline his diaries (his medium for time travel) don't exist.
*When Max takes out her phone to call Warren and ask him for the photo, you can see that the carrier on Max's phone in "Vaireezon", which might be a reference to *{{Wiki|Verizon Wireless|Verizon}}*.

## Nightmare 
*In [Max's Nightmare](max_s_nightmare.md), when sneaking behind Frank Bowers with a flashlight, he says, "Me and Rachel are floating down here in the sewer... Come on down!", which is a reference to Stephen King's *IT*.
*While hiding from Warren in the maze he says, "Max... Where are you? Max, come out to play... Come out to play!" This is a reference to the 1979 movie *{{Wiki|The_Warriors_(film)|The Warriors}}*, where Luther, leader of a rival gang, says this famous line to the Warriors--"Warriors, come out to play!"
*When trapped for too long in the maze, Max can make an inner comment about Freddy Krueger, a character of the "A Nightmare on Elm Street" film series.{{Headphones|file# ‎VO_E5_7B.STM_208~Act_E5_7B_ArtClass_NightmareLines_Scripted_Max_060.ogg}} Freddy is a demon attacking his victims in their dreams, causing their deaths in the real world as well — which is fitting Max's situation.
*A sequence in the finale involves walking down the same seemingly identical hallway time after time, making small interactions along the way, which closely resembles a sequence from the *Silent Hill* video game.
*The edges of walkways in the labyrinthine segments of Max's nightmare echo the edges of walkways in the Ego Rooms in *Remember Me*.
*One of the lines scribbled in Max's journal during the nightmare sequence reads, "The doe is a lie," which is repeated three times in capitals across the top of the left-hand page. This is a deliberate nod to the popularized line, "The Cake Is a Lie," from the video game {{wiki|Portal (video game)|Portal}},Confirmed by [Alysianne Bui](alysianne_bui.md) who was one of the two artists that worked on the journal. in which a cake is used as a fictitious motivator for the player to perform tasks. "The Cake Is a Lie" reference spread outside gaming forums to become an idiom meaning, "You are chasing after an empty, unattainable goal."See [http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-cake-is-a-lie this page] for more about "The Cake Is a Lie."
