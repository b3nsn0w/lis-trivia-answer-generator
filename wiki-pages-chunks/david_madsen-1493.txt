Here is a section of the wiki page for David Madsen:

## Background 
David has a strong military background. He suffers from Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and possibly takes medication for it. His dog tags, found in his bedside drawer, reveal that his blood type is O-Positive and that he is of the Baptist faith.

David first met his wife Joyce in the [Two Whales Diner](two_whales_diner.md) where she works; their first meeting was on the 27th of November 2008, according to an old receipt that he keeps in his car. They were married sometime after this, and Joyce took his name (it appears on many of the bills in the household). He seems to care a great deal for Chloe, despite the two never really getting along. A birthday card from him in [David's Garage](his_garage.md) drawer depicts his happiness at being Chloe's step-dad, and [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) even considers it as a password for his laptop.

David seems to enjoy mechanics, as he fixes up the old car in the garage ─ at the sight of which Max describes him as a "gearhead". Hunting is another of his hobbies, clear from the taxidermy and photos in the Madsen home. David seems worried about possible apocalyptic scenarios, not surprising due to his PTSD. He has a self-help book on how to survive the apocalypse, and stores a lot of suitable food products in the garage for emergencies.

David seems to have supportive parents, as evident from a tape found in his belongings entitled "Message from Mom and Dad - 07/2007".

His [Investigation Files#David's Files](secret_files.md) reveal that David started to investigate [Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md), [Mark Jefferson](mark_jefferson.md) and drug dealer [Frank Bowers](frank_bowers.md) eventually after [Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md)'s disappearance six months ago, and has tracked them, including his step-daughter Chloe and student [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md), for at least one week until October 7. He also installed cameras in his family's house and planned to put Blackwell under surveillance too. It is possible that Nathan's father, [Sean Prescott](sean_prescott.md), hired David to protect his son.

Other files from Wells' computer reveal, furthermore, that David has accused [Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md) of drug dealing prior to her disappearance and that he was also following her and taking pictures.

## Episode One - "[Episode 1: Chrysalis](chrysalis.md)" 
Max's introduction to David comes in the form of him as Head of Security in Blackwell accusing her of breaking the fire alarm in the girls' bathroom in Blackwell. He is set up as a rash and accusatory man before he is asked to turn off the alarms by [Raymond Wells](principal_wells.md).

Outside, Max can talk to [Brooke Scott](brooke_scott.md) about her drone. Brooke makes an offhand comment that she'd bet David would love to spy on everyone at Blackwell using her kind of drone. Max can also speak to [Michelle Grant](ms__grant.md) and find out that David is planning to set up numerous surveillance cameras all over the Blackwell campus in a bid to help protect students. However, she and many others are against this, and she tries to get Max to sign a petition to stop it.

The next time Max sees David, he is hassling Kate Marsh. It seems he is interrogating her about drugs, or her attendance at the last [Vortex Club](vortex_club.md) party. Max can choose to intervene or not.

Intervene# InterveneMax breaks up the confrontation, asking David to stop hassling Kate. David retorts saying that he is on official campus business. He sees his bullying as merely part of his job. Although Kate appreciates it, David does not, believing that he is doing some good by finding out what Kate has been up to at the last Vortex Party. He threatens Max, saying he will remember the conversation, and leaves the two girls alone.
|-|Take the photoTake the photoDavid continues to hassle Kate, telling her to watch herself and figure out which side she's on (presumably the side of justice and security or the side of inappropriate drug-related behavior). Kate is not pleased with Max, although now the photograph provides proof that the situation happened.

When Nathan is swinging at Warren in the parking lot after meeting up with Max, David runs up to stop the fight.

Later on at Chloe's house, Max is able to search David's belongings in the garage while looking for tools to repair her camera. She can discover secret files proving that he's been spying on Kate Marsh. She can also find out that David has installed cameras in all his house's rooms and plans to put Blackwell under surveillance, as well.

When David returns home he will come up to check on Chloe after hearing the loud music Chloe turned on in her room. Max may choose to hide from David and avoid blame for the weed Chloe was caught smoking or take the blame. If she looked at his secret files and left them in ruins, he will complain that Chloe has been through his things; he also states that one of his guns are missing.

Don't Hide, Take the blame# Don't Hide, Take the blameMax doesn't hide anywhere in the room, and takes the blame for the joint when Chloe suggests the joint belongs to Max. David threatens her with regard to her Blackwell scholarship, and doesn't want to see her in the household again. Chloe will show Max the missing gun she stole from David afterwards.
|-|Don't Hide and don't take the blameDon't Hide and don't take the blameMax doesn't hide anywhere in the room, and doesn't take the blame for the joint when Chloe suggests the joint belongs to Max. David will believe Max and slap Chloe's face, warning her not to mess around with drugs any more. Chloe will accuse Max of bailing on her the same way her other friends did. Chloe will leave the room first without waiting for Max.
|-|Hide, Intervene# Hide, InterveneMax hides in the closet, but intervenes as David discovers the joint. She takes the blame and David reacts by threatening her Blackwell scholarship and asking her not to come back to the house again. Chloe will show Max the missing gun she stole from David afterwards.
|-|Stay HiddenStay HiddenMax stays hidden throughout the confrontation between David and Chloe. When he finds the joint, Chloe stands up to him. He slaps her face, and warns her not to mess around with drugs any more. Chloe will not hold it against Max for staying hidden, and will wait for Max to leave with her.

At the end of the episode, David is seen atop a ladder installing or adjusting a security camera outside the Price/Madsen family home.
