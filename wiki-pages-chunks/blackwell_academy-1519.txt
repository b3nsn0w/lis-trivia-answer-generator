**Blackwell Academy's brochure**

**Blackwell Academy** is a private senior high school located in [Arcadia Bay](arcadia_bay.md), Oregon. The school specializes in Science and Arts and is currently overseen by [Raymond Wells](principal_raymond_wells.md). It appears in *[Life is Strange](life_is_strange.md)* and *[Life is Strange: Before the Storm](life_is_strange__before_the_storm.md)* and is mentioned in *[The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit](the_awesome_adventures_of_captain_spirit.md)*.

## Biography 
The following is what [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) wrote about Blackwell Academy in her [Max's Diary](diary.md):

*"I GOT ACCEPTED INTO BLACKWELL ACADEMY.*

''If words could dance this would be a rave. Even though I've never been to one. But who cares because I GOT INTO BLACKWELL ACADEMY[, a unique and famous private school for seniors! NO KIDS ALLOWED]! I didn't think I would be so excited since it's not like I didn't used to live in the same town. But when I saw the text from the Blackwell scholarship office, I could literally feel my pulse speed up.*

*But Seattle wasn't like a fable. Au contraire. Now Blackwell Academy seems more exotic to me than any other place in the world. To study photography under [Mark Jefferson](mark_jefferson.md)... SIGH. Insert hearts and flowers. Plus there will be cool diverse students from everywhere. It won't be like my high school now..."''

The text in brackets was removed after the release of Episode 5 (before 1.0.0.371598).

## Background 
According to [Michelle Grant](michelle_grant.md), the school is built on old [Native American](native_american.md) land, shared between the natives and the early colonial settlers "in peace, not fear and violence."[File:Blackwell_Flyer_TWD.png](thumb.md)
The tribes who were in the area first had welcomed the settlers and both cultures "found a mutual symbiosis and thrived." There are some undisclosed fascinating facts about Blackwell, and Ms. Grant claims there's a lot of power in the region which she thinks "helps the creative juices flow." 

In 1910, Jeremiah Blackwell founded the academy, striving for excellence among the student body. Jeremiah's statue resides at the front of the building, bearing the motto "*The future needs excellence*". In the [Two Whales Diner](two_whales_diner.md), there is also a black and white flyer of Blackwell, boasting "*Global Excellence in Arts and Science for over a hundred years and counting*."

Blackwell is partially owned by, and financially funded by the [Prescott Family](prescott_family.md). In 1998, they donated the dormitory building to Blackwell.

Between the events of *[Life is Strange: Before the Storm](before_the_storm.md)* and *[Life is Strange](life_is_strange__season_1.md)* (2010 - 2013), Blackwell Academy changes its curriculum and student body make-up. The narrative reasons for this that are explored via secondary plot-lines over the events of *Before the Storm*. Blackwell's change results in the hiring of famous art teachers like [Mark Jefferson](mark_jefferson.md) and the eventual shift to a specialized two-year extended senior program. Prior to this evolution, Blackwell Academy is a fairly standard private high school with four grades.
For certain prestigious private schools, this fifth year can amount to college credit or can be seen as giving students a leg-up to get into a really prestigious arts education.[https://www.facebook.com/groups/1578433839080885/permalink/1938590309731901/ Public post] made by Square Enix's *Life is Strange* [Community Management](community_manager.md) in the 'Life is Strange (GAME)' group on Facebook (7th July 2017); [Media:BtS timeline CM statement.png](statement_screenshot.md)
