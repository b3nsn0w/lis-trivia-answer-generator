## Chloe's House 
*The graffiti on Chloe’s wall that says “everybody lies no exceptions” is a line from the old animated MTV series *{{Wiki|Daria}},* which is focused on Daria Morgendorffer, a smart, acerbic, and somewhat misanthropic teenage girl who observes the world around her. Chloe is even drawn in a cool little Daria style next to it.

## Lighthouse 
*There are a couple of graffiti on a shack near the [lighthouse](lighthouse.md), one of those is of a symbol that represents the characters in a French novel by {{Wiki|Alain Damasio}}, a co-founder of [Don't Nod](don_t_nod.md), named *La Horde du Contrevent* (or *The WindWalkers)*. Wind is a recurring theme in the novel, and upon looking at the graffiti, Max says, "Weird, those [glyphs](glyphs.md) remind me of... the wind."

* On page 22 is a sticker graphic that says, "Three Meters Above The Sky", which appears to reference the 2004 Italian film inspired by the novel *Tre metri sopra il cielo* by Federico Moccia (literally "Three meters above the sky"). The film is summarized as "A romantic drama for teenagers that tells the story of two youngsters belonging to opposite worlds. It's the chronicle of an improbable relationship that is practically impossible but just as inevitable. It will end up dragging the couple along for a voyage of discovery on which they will experience true love together for the first time. She is a well-to-do girl. He is a rebellious boy, addicted to risk and danger*."*Plot summary of 'Three Meters Above the Sky": https://www.globomedia.es/en/cinema/3-meters-above-sky [http://variety.com/2010/film/reviews/three-steps-above-heaven-1117944186/ Variety magazine] writes: "Slowly, he becomes more tender, [the girl] more rebellious." The descriptions of these two characters appear to match the characters of Max and Chloe rather well.
