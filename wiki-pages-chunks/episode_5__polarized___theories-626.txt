Here is a section of the wiki page for Episode 5: Polarized - Theories:

revealed.
* It is only shown in the game that the street by the Two Whales Diner was mostly destroyed by the storm in the Sacrifice Arcadia Bay ending, as most of the buildings there are made of wood. It's not shown if [Blackwell Academy](blackwell_academy.md), a brick building, had been completely destroyed by the storm as well.
* As we know, the [Bigfoots](bigfoots.md) football game was supposed to take place on the day of the storm, and the storm probably postponed or interrupted it. Regarding the fact that [Evan Harris](evan_harris.md), [Alyssa Anderson](alyssa_anderson.md), and Warren (people who aren't bothered by sports) aren't in Blackwell, maybe it was taking place but everyone watching or playing the game was killed on the field. Otherwise, they would have sought shelter in the school - a solid brick building that likely withstood the storm - and perhaps survived.

## Max and Chloe's Fate 
* It's unclear whether Max just changes reality or creates new [timelines](timelines.md) that run and exist parallel to each other for each time she [rewind](rewind.md)s and alters the past. If the second was confirmed, the end would not boil down to "save the city or save Chloe", but you only would decide which reality you prefer to live in. In other words, even when you sacrifice Chloe, the storm is still occurring, but in another reality that you left behind. If this is the case and it may also explain the [Meteorological Anomalies](strange_weather_phenomenon.md) experienced throughout the game. It's possible that Max has the ability to create alternate "branches" in the timeline, however, these branches are fundamentally unstable, meaning the entire game has been taking place in some alternate "side branch", in a universe that is slowly breaking down. It's only by returning to the "main branch" that Max can continue to exist in life normally.
* There is a high probability that Max in case she still has her time controlling ability after her final choice, she can still go back into time in Sacrifice Chloe ending to prevent it. (considering in Sacrifice Town ending her certainty has shown after her tearing up the [Blue Butterfly](blue_butterfly.md) photo up, but in Sacrifice Chloe ending she didn't; and even if her autopilot self didn't take it, she still got the first selfie which she took in Jefferson's class) Though, if she tried to go back into time with one of those photos, she would likely end in the same present unless she leaves a warning message to her autopilot-self,** **since she would do everything the same as the last time from that point on ).
