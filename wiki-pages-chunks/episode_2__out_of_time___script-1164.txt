**Ms. Grant:** Funny, I was just thinking about you, Max.

**Ms. Grant:** Right back at you, Max.

Petition.# Petition.**Max:** How is your campaign going?

{{#tag:tabber|Signed the petitionSigned the petition**Ms. Grant:** You signed the petition. Now it's your campaign, too. Thanks for stepping up. More people would rather send a text than sign a petition. That's how they keep us all distracted. Nobody will notice cameras on every square foot.

**Max:** I know. I really hope you keep those cameras from taking over Blackwell.

**Ms. Grant:** Max, with students like you, we sure will.

{{!}}-{{!}}Didn't sign the petition# Didn't sign the petition**Ms. Grant:** It's missing somebody who should care, but no finger-pointing here, Max. More people would rather send a text than sign a petition. That's how they keep us all distracted. Nobody will notice cameras on every square foot.

**Max:** Some of us want to use our cameras for good.

**Ms. Grant:** But people like David Madsen want to use them to spy.

**Max:** Geez, I'm not like him, Ms. Grant.

**Ms. Grant:** I know, Max. But the trick is to make sure Blackwell Academy doesn't end up like him.

**Ms. Grant:** You know my stock teacher answer: there are no dumb questions. Ask away.

**Max:** Would you add potassium or sodium to a chemical mix for this week's experiment?

**Ms. Grant:** Neither, unless you want a face full of powder. I would add chlorine.

|-|Photos.# Photos.**Max:** I'm just thinking about all the autumn photos I want to take...

**Ms. Grant:** Oh, this is my favorite time of year. I do love the season change. This whole campus is a visual delight. I know Mr. Jefferson loves to shoot around here.

{{#tag:tabber|You know Jefferson.You know Jefferson.**Max:** You must know Mr. Jefferson pretty well by now.

**Ms. Grant:** I certainly know him as a talented artist and terrific teacher. I've been here a little longer, but he's made a bigger mark...

{{!}}-{{!}}You like photography.# You like photography.**Max:** You must like photography.

**Ms. Grant:** I do, but I am certainly no artist. I'm all about the science. You can't debate numbers.

**Ms. Grant:** I have to say, it's not quite autumn enough yet.

{{#tag:tabber|Snow?Snow?**Max:** What about that snow yesterday? What's your scientific explanation?

**Ms. Grant:** Our climate is moving beyond explanation. Of course, some of the tribes here might see it different...

{{!}}-{{!}}I can't wait.# I can't wait.**Max:** I can't wait for fall either. It's all about the atmosphere.

**Ms. Grant:** You're the artist and I'm the scientist... like yin and yang.

|-|Bye.Bye.**Max:** I'm sorry, Ms. Grant, but I have to get going.

**Ms. Grant:** Go on, Max. We'll talk again. Real soon.
