## Background
[File:Max's classi.jpg](thumb.md)
Max grew up in Arcadia Bay, where she and Chloe were close childhood friends who always hung around each other and used to play pirates at their homes or in the woods, dreaming of their future and the adventures they would experience together.

In 2008, when Max was 13, she was with Chloe at her house when Chloe's father, [William Price](william_price.md), tragically died in a car crash. Soon after the accident, Max moved to Seattle with her parents, leaving her best friend and her old life behind. The two fell out of touch, especially after Chloe's mother [Joyce Price](joyce_price.md) remarried. Five years later, Max is granted a scholarship for Blackwell Academy - a school of arts and sciences. She moves back to Arcadia Bay, mostly due to her admiration for the work of her famous new teacher, [Mark Jefferson](mark_jefferson.md), but she also wonders if she had wanted to come back all along, just to see if she and Chloe are still friends. Although Max enjoyed her time in Seattle, saying it was cool and perfect for photography, she also felt "kinda lonely" and out of her league.

It is clear that both her parents care about her greatly, due to their separate birthday texts and her [Vanessa Caulfield](mother.md)'s encouraging texts at various points in each episode. Her mother gets a special mention as Max talks about the coconut bites in her bedroom, revealing that she was given a $200 gift certificate with them for her birthday. On top of the money her [Ryan Caulfield](father.md) transferred to her account, it is clear that the Caulfields are a well-off family. She speaks fondly of her dad, reminiscing about them going to hockey games together to support the Seattle Thunderbirds. It's also revealed that Max's teddy bear, the Captain, is special to her because she remembers going to the ER with her mother to have his eye removed after she swallowed it.

Max has dreamed of becoming a photographer since childhood and has a passion for analog photography, greatly preferring it to digital images. When looking at the retro cameras in the art classroom, Max is thrilled. She even has a vintage camera website open on her laptop in "[Episode 1: Chrysalis](chrysalis.md)", dubbed "Camera Porn".

Max also reveals that she had two friends back in Seattle; [Kristen](kristen.md) and [Fernando](fernando.md), although not much is known about them other than that they were drunk at the {{Wiki|Fremont Troll}}.

Max plays guitar, as evident from the butterfly covered acoustic guitar in her room. She plays her guitar right-handed.
