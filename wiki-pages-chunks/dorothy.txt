|Dear Joyce,

Thank you for keeping me updated on Chloe's
condition. I can only imagine the struggle you
and [William Price](william.md) are going through. I am so sorry
that I can't help you with a loan at this time.

Like everybody else, I'm underwater with my own
medical bills. Please give Chloe a hug and my
best wishes.

Love, Aunt Dorothy
