AMA!

I have a couple questions:

#Were there any particularly memorable/weird/funny/etc dialogue that you recorded for any of your characters in Life is Strange that ultimately ended up being left out of the finished game?
#Which Life is Strange character would you say that you identify with the most?
#What do you think of Marshfield?
#Is Kate Marsh favorite tea chamomile?
#Which of your films would you cite as your favorite? (If any.)

It's my pleasure! Thanks for being here!

# Uhmm I remember in the Vortex Club scene they had me calling the pool noodle a "Water Weenie", which I thought was adorable and hilarious and I don't believe it's in the game.
#Probably Max! Awkward and nerdy and shy. Yup thats me haha.
#Love it! Not sure how it would go down with Kates beliefs but I like it haha
#It could be! I think she definitely drinks a cup every night before bed!
#Emperor's New Groove! (yes, I am a child)

Hey Daye!

#Who do you think Max and Kate shit-talked over their tea sessions?
#How do you feel about Kate's other friends (Stella, Alyssa, Dana?) I feel bad for Dana since she managed to screw over her friendship with Kate.
#What made you take up the ukulele?

**dayebraham_lincoln**

Hello!!

#I don't know if Kate would ever go so far. They might discuss how to get Victoria to be nicer. Maybe they'd make fun of Warren a little bit, in a sweet way haha
#I don't understand why none of them seemed to reach out to Kate when she was so upset and left it up to Max (other than, there wouldn't be a game if Max didn't need to help lol) I like all of them though, I'm sure Kate would quickly forgive Dana.
#Reteaching myself guitar just seemed too hard XD also a good friend of mine started teaching me on hers and it's just simple to pick up and start learning. At least more so than other instruments.

Afternoon (at least where I am)!

My only question is, who is ever more responsible, or who is responsible, for pushing too far on someone who's dealing with depression (as it is relatable to the decision Max has to make). I certainly could never place the blame on one soul, as I believe everyone is held accountable, for not helping the person out, or just not noticing (which is why I originally chose Jefferson, and you can see how that favoured my fortune).

P.S. Kate was the first video game character to make me cry, even though I was able to save her. That whole scene caught me by surprise; looking upward of the dorm was enough, and the teetering on the ledge was wrenching. Happy you were apart of this experience, means the world to me.

I think society is to blame for not taking Mental Health more seriously and not giving it the focus it deserves. The victim is too often blamed for something that is not their fault. And because it's not important to society, we aren't taught how to recognize it, how to help. I strongly urge everyone to take mental health more seriously, and not look at it with embarrassment. It's okay to need help. Life is hard. We ALL need help in some way or another, at some point or another. It's okay.

Hey Daye! Nice to see you around the subreddit!

#What's your favorite sandwich?
#What was it like to find out that Kate turned out to be rather unexpectedly popular with the fandom?
#Is there anyone you like seeing Kate paired with, romantically or otherwise?
#What's up next for you?

**dayebraham_lincoln**

Hello! Nice to see you too :)

#I LOVE cucumber tea sandwiches
#Amazing! They brought me back in to record when they weren't sure they were going to. Thank you all! And the fans of this game, you're all so wonderful and kind and supportive. I'm so lucky to have been involved.
#Alice! :P I love seeing all the creativity and fan art of the fandom shipping all the different characters.
#Right now I'm mostly focused on my Twitch channel, but always on the lookout for the next fun project!

Hi Dayeanne!

#Kate’s a character many people relate with a lot because of her depression. What’s it like to be the voice of a character people identify with as a type of character that doesn’t get represented much in gaming?
#What were some of the details of Kate’s character the voice directors gave you when you voiced her character?
#What’s your favourite part of being a voice actor, and what type of characters would you like to voice if you had the opportunity to voice another character?

**dayebraham_lincoln**

Hello!

#I am **so** honored to have given voice to a character that so many have found hope and connection in. It brings me so much joy that a supportive and loving community has grown out of this game and character, it truly amazes me.
#Sad. I'm trying to remember but I think it was something like a sweet girl who is sad and depressed.
#I love that you can play SO many different kinds of characters, you're not limited by how you look and if how you look fits in with the show or the rest of the cast etc. I really wanna voice a creepy character haha but really anything, I would have fun with anything!

Hi Dayeanne!

I absolutely adore Kate, and can empathize hugely with her in-game story!

A couple of questions:

1) Were you able to draw on any real-life experiences or beliefs to get into character as Kate?

2) Were you surprised at the huge amount of fans that Kate has, considering that she is effectively a supporting
