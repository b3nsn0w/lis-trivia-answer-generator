Here is a section of the wiki page for Mark Jefferson:

a phone call from Chloe back in Arcadia Bay that the [storm](storm.md) is destroying the town, Max goes back in time using her competition photo. She destroys her photo that she would have handed into Mr. Jefferson and creates another timeline where she doesn't win but ends up in the dark room again.

Back in the dark room, Max expresses shock at how Jefferson is still free and notorious rather than being in jail. It just so happens that Jefferson was in the middle of asking Max a question and comments that she's still zoning out just like in class. He prompts her to answer his question but Max responds with an insult much to Jefferson's amusement. He notices that her nose is bleeding but assumes it's due to dosing her with drugs, he remarks that a nose bleed should be the last of her worries as he intends to kill her very shortly. He comments on Max's waste of talent and reveals that he burned her diary when he found out that she destroyed her photo entry for the Everyday Heroes contest. He mentions that he's noticed Max's transformation between nerd to hero and considers it being very weird, he then makes reference to the storm outside and remarks how it's all very weird again.

Jefferson praises Max for being his subject, describing it as an "honor" to work with her during their final sessions. He hopes one day that her photos will be appreciated for what they truly capture "the loss of youth". With that, Jefferson decides to end Max's life. Max tries to plead with Jefferson telling him that he doesn't understand what's happening but he simply ignores her. Just as Jefferson's about to deliver the fatal dose, David Madsen arrives. After several attempts of trial and error with Max using her ability to aid David, he finally overpowers Jefferson and places him under arrest. David then frees Max and enquires about what happened to Chloe.

Max reveals to David that Jefferson killed Chloe. Upon hearing this, David becomes incredibly enraged and distraught. In a fit of rage, he pulls out his gun as Jefferson attempts to stand up and shoots him in the head. David then apologises to Max and laments upon what he's done, as he sits on the floor and grieves.

Max tells David that Chloe avoided Jefferson by deciding to stay behind and "medicate". David, relieved, says that for once he's glad that Chloe's a stoner. He then tells Max to leave as she's seen enough of this place. As Max goes to leave, David investigates Jefferson's computer and Jefferson himself is left alive with the intention of locking him up for good.

Which prevents the sequence of events that follow: Chloe's Death, Max being captured and Jefferson's potential death. Instead, they reveal all of what they discovered to David. Thus, Chloe lives and Jefferson ultimately is arrested for his crimes.

Jefferson makes an appearance in [Max's Nightmare](max_s_nightmare.md), he is first seen in his classroom where he asks Max if she would like to spend the rest of her life with him in his dark room. Max is forced to comply with an agreeable answer which makes Jefferson happy. He is later encountered again as one of the first people hunting for Max as she tries to escape her nightmare. He will have specific lines depending on the choices made involving him previously.

It's unknown what happens to Jefferson in the Sacrifice Arcadia Bay ending, it's presumed that he likely survived the storm, as David is confirmed to have rescued Victoria from the Dark Room in this timeline during the storm and survives.

[File:09 1920.jpg](thumb.md)If the timeline is reversed and Chloe had been shot dead by Nathan back in Blackwell, Nathan is placed under arrest and is interrogated by the police. During his interrogation, Nathan reveals Jefferson's crimes and he too is arrested. ## Alternative Timeline 
Although we do not directly meet him in the [Alternative Timeline](alternative_timeline.md), his photographs are still on display around the Blackwell campus. This calls into question whether alternative Max came back to Arcadia Bay for his teaching or not. However, Rachel Amber is still missing, meaning that Jefferson's involvement with her kidnapping and murder could still be possible in the alternative timeline.

## The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit 
[Emily Eriksen](emily_eriksen.md), a former student of Blackwell Academy, owned one of Jefferson's books, which was later read by her [Chris Eriksen](son.md).

## Episode 5 - "Wolves"

Mark Jefferson is mentioned by Victoria in a letter that she had recently sent to David.
