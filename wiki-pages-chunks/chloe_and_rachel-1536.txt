Here is a section of the wiki page for Chloe and Rachel:

## Before the Storm 
:*In DONTNOD's original game, the status of Rachel's relationship with Chloe by the time of her disappearance remains unknown which was an intended ambiguity that allowed *Before the Storm* to explore both possibilities (i.e. friendship and romance). However, throughout both games, if choosing to entertain the idea that both girls were romantically involved, it still remains largely unclear if Rachel's feelings were genuine for Chloe (e.g. a pretense or fleeting curiosity), or just being there for Chloe during such a low point in her life.''
[File:chloeandrachel-bts-firstlook.png](thumb.md) The first time [Chloe Price (Before the Storm)](chloe_price.md) and [Rachel Amber (Before the Storm)](rachel_amber.md) meet is at the [Old Mill](old_mill.md). Chloe goes to a punk club late at night to watch [Firewalk](firewalk.md) play. She then proceeds to where the band is playing; however, she is knocked back and accidentally spills [Sheldon Pike](a_man.md)'s beer. He becomes upset and tries to stop her from leaving before letting her go. Chloe then proceeds to get to the band by going upstairs. When she gets upstairs she starts dancing to the music before being interrupted by the same man whose beer she spilled earlier and [Peter Gillespie](his_friend.md). The two men try to threaten her despite Chloe's apologies and insults. One of the men smashes a bottle and is about to attack Chloe when Rachel Amber appears and insults the two men.[File:1504428666785.png](thumb.md) Chloe then has the option to either run or attack. If she attacks, she will successfully take down one of the men, while the other punches her in the face before she escapes. If Chloe runs, Rachel will throw a bottle at the men, hitting one in the face. As Chloe and Rachel run back down the stairs, Frank will stop the men and Chloe will flip them off before returning to the band. She and Rachel mosh to the music.

The next day Chloe wakes up in her room and ponders the events of the previous night, wondering, *"That... girl. Was that Rachel Amber?"* If she checks her computer she will see that a picture of her and Rachel is on social media. 

After David drives her to school, she can explore outside Blackwell. She goes to pick up her DVD from [Steph Gingrich](steph_gingrich.md). Steph asks Chloe whether she knows if Rachel is a gamer, and what happened between her and Chloe last night, wondering if it was just a "friend thing". Chloe can either inquire what exactly Steph wants to know or say that she and Rachel don't know each other that well. [Mikey North](mikey_north.md) will comment that Steph has a crush on Rachel.

Later, while Chloe is going to enter Blackwell, she is interrupted by [Drew North](drew_north.md) and [Nathan Prescott (Before the Storm)](nathan_prescott.md), who begin arguing. [Samantha Myers](samantha_myers.md) begs Chloe to stop them. Chloe can enter a [Backtalk](backtalk.md) challenge in which she berates Drew. If she is successful, Samantha will laugh at Drew and tell him to shut up. Chloe admires her bravery. If she is unsuccessful or doesn't attempt a backtalk challenge, Drew will throw Nathan's portfolio into the fountain.

As Chloe tries to enter the building, Rachel bursts through the door and grabs her hand, taking her to the [Drama Lab](drama_lab.md). Chloe and Rachel watch a rehearsal of *The Tempest*. Rachel interrupts and asks the opinions of [Hayden Jones (Before the Storm)](hayden_jones.md), [Dana Ward (Before the Storm)](dana_ward.md), and [Travis Keaton](mr__keaton.md) on her outfit. They all respond positively. Chloe, with a dazed expression, comments that "Rachel looks awesome," and becomes shy when Rachel winks at her. [File:chloeandrachel-bts-dramalab.png](thumb.md) A debate begins on some of Dana's lines involving true love. Rachel asks Chloe what she thinks about the play: "Are Miranda's feelings for Ferdinand just inexperience and dramatic circumstances...or has she met the love of her life?". If Chloe says ''"It's true love"'', she will say "Sometimes when you meet someone who's going to change your life you just know it, I guess," while looking into Rachel's eyes, and this will impress her.

After this, Rachel will go to the dressing room and asks for Chloe to bring her belt to her. After Chloe brings her belt, Rachel still continues on changing her clothes instead of taking it. Chloe has the option to throw the belt over or bring it to Rachel. If Chloe chooses to throw the belt over, it will hit Rachel and Chloe will apologize. If Chloe instead chooses to directly bring the belt to Rachel, Chloe will see Rachel in her bra and becomes embarrassed, trying to look away. After Rachel finishes changing her clothes, the two speak about the events of last night and Rachel remarks that she thought about it all night. She asks Chloe to skip school with her, to which Chloe willingly agrees. [File:Yesyesitis.png](thumb.md) During the [Train](train.md) scene, Chloe wonders why she was struggling to say something to Rachel, feeling the unfamiliar sensation of nervousness. Depending on her earlier choice to bring the belt or throw it over, Chloe will have varying degrees of nervousness. They talk and Chloe mentions that her only friend [Maxine Caulfield (Before the Storm)](max.md) left for "greener, more Northern pastures". Rachel is sympathetic. [File:1507209108386.jpg](thumb.md) Chloe and Rachel then play [Two Truths and a Lie](two_truths_and_a_lie.md). Chloe can either play honestly or
