Here is a section of the wiki page for Nathan Prescott:

## Personality 
Nathan is outwardly aggressive, spoiled, rich, and acts in the manner of an archetypal brat. [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) describes him as "[Victoria Chase](victoria_chase.md)'s male clone, with way more money and attitude." He often uses his family's influence to escape any responsibility for his actions, believing himself to be above the law. He appears to lack empathy for others and shows no regard for the suffering of those he deems a threat to his authority.

Nathan is inwardly mentally unstable, has been in psychiatric treatment for years and takes various medications, as implied by the pills found in his dorm room in "[Episode 4: Dark Room](dark_room.md)" and in his locker in the [Blackwell Swimming Pool](blackwell_swimming_pool.md) in "[Episode 3: Chaos Theory](chaos_theory.md)". It is Nathan's own father who has been telling him to take medication, evident from notes found in Nathan's dorm room in Episode 4. These medications include Risperidone - an antipsychotic medication used in treatment for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

It is suggested that Nathan may suffer from anxiety, paranoia and muscle spasms due to the bathroom scene in "[Episode 1: Chrysalis](chrysalis.md)". It is also heavily implied that he suffers from psychosis, judging from the drawings found in Episode 3 and Episode 4. Furthermore, one of his psychiatrists explained in a letter to his father that Nathan is "disconnected from reality" and considers him a threat to himself and the people around him. His medications suggest a diagnosis with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, the side effects of which (Restless Legs Syndrome) are visible throughout the game.

Nathan appears to be traumatized and bullied by many adults forcing him to act out throughout the game. He is under a lot of pressure, especially from his father. He is convinced that nobody likes him and that his life is hell.If Max lets Warren beat up Nathan, he can later be seen lying on the ground, crying and saying, "Everybody hates me... everybodyâ€¦" His excessive partying and taking drugs, as well as his outward egocentricity and lack of empathy might be his way of trying to cover up or redirect his emotional pain.

Nathan is cultured and has a collection of art, film, and photography in his bedroom. He has an affinity for a dark expressionist style. His photography collection leads Max to believe he enjoys "tortured subjects" when she explores his room. He has a photographic penchant for dead animals and his admiration of graveyards. When Max examines his dorm room, she finds pictures of [Media:Nathan-deadbirds.png](dead_birds.md) and a [Media:Pompidou-nathanphoto.png](dead_pompidou.md) if he has been killed earlier. For the [Everyday Heroes Photo Contest](everyday_heroes_contest.md), Nathan entered a [Media:Nathan2.png](photograph.md) of a janitor working at a graveyard.

## Biography 
The following is what Max wrote about Nathan in [Max's Journal](her_journal.md): 

''Homework is kicking my ass. I bet the teachers grade harder just to stop you from feeling special. But Victoria Chase and her snob minions still front like they're honored guests of Blackwell. The bros here aren't that different. Nathan is Victoria's male clone, with way more money and attitude, if that's possible.*

*His family is the oldest in Arcadia Bay and I heard stories about them when I was a kid. The Prescotts give a shitload of bank to Blackwell, so Nathan acts like he literally owns the school. Yesterday during class, he put his feet on the desk, started texting and the teacher didn't say jack!*

*I'd get suspended. But him and Victoria are part of this silly elite "[Vortex Club](vortex_club.md)" that puts on popular parties and so they get their way. Its good to be the king and queen.*

*Just when I thought Victoria Chase would be the worst of my social problems, now I have to deal with Dickbagtheasshole. But I guess he was the one who triggered my crazy rewind power by shooting that girl in the bathroom. He's 19 and already a scary fucking prick.*

*I guess I have a little advantage on Nathan by being able to manipulate time, but if he shoots me I may not be able to reverse anything. I have to be careful around him, especially since he's obviously got friends in high places as his family last name is practically branded on every building here at Blackwell. His money against mine...*

*On one hand, I do kinda feel bad for Nathan because he doesn't seem to be in control, like he's doped up or over medicated. On the other, he's an asshole who nobody has called out. And he almost killed (/did kill?) a girl on campus. Should I go straight to the police? What do I say about my rewind power? Like I'd say anything. I just have to watch my own back from now on. Oh, school days!''
