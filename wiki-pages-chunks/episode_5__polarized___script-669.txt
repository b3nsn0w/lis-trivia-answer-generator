Here is a section of the wiki page for Episode 5: Polarized - Script:

## **Plane** 
*Max wakes up on the [Plane](plane.md). Principal Wells is asleep in the aisle seat next to her.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Whoa!

*Max looks out the window at the wing of the plane.*

**Max:** *(thinking)'' Okay... You're okay, Max... You're safe...on a plane. I hope I did everything right this time.

*Max leans forward to look at the newspaper in front of Wells. The headline says "Local Teacher Arrested!".*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Good work, David.

*Max takes her phone out of her pocket to check her text messages.*

**Chloe (SMS):** HOLY SHIT YOU RULE MAX!!!!!

**Chloe (SMS):** i am so proud of my superstar

**Chloe (SMS):** this is just the start of your career

**Max:** Chloe... Oh, you're alive... Oh, you're alive. I did it... I fixed everything. Wowser.

*Max puts her phone away again and relaxes in the seat.*

**Announcement:** Please fasten your seat and stow any electronic gear until the plane is on the ground and at the gate. Thank you. We're starting our descent in a few minutes. It's a beautiful day in San Francisco with clear skies and cool 60 degrees. We hope you enjoyed your trip, and we thank you very much for choosing PacificWest Air. Come fly with us anytime.

**Principal Wells:** *(groaning)* Ah, I don't think so. I'm hoping these airline seats get smaller so I won't have to fly at all anymore.

**Conversation with Principal Wells**

**Max:** How did you sleep?

**Principal Wells:** Hope I wasn't snoring out loud, Max...

**Max:** Just a bit.

**Principal Wells:** It's...been a tough week at Blackwell, so I hope you'll forgive me. Between Mr. Jefferson and the Prescotts, things have been...hectic, to say the least.

**Max:** I totally get it, Principal Wells.

**Principal Wells:** That's a smart way of telling me to stop whining. We are proud of you for representing Blackwell at the "Everyday Heroes" contest. I know I'm not exactly the guide you wanted in San Francisco. But we all want you to have a great experience here.

**Max:** I already am, and we're not even there.

''Max's nose starts bleeding and she wipes away the blood.*

**Max:** *(thinking)'' Christ! Another nosebleed? Max...you're not just screwing around with time...

*The screen fades out. Another timestream montage appears: Max tied to a chair in the Dark Room is replaced by Max and Wells exiting the airport and getting into a taxi.*
