Here is a section of the wiki page for Max's Room:

## Episode Two - "[Episode 2: Out of Time](out_of_time.md)" 
The following day on October 8, Max's cell phone, [Max's Journal](journal.md) and camera will be visible next to her bed and on her desk when she wakes up and can be interacted with similarly to the Tab button.

The first page of Max's journal will mention she has carried out an exhaustive study on time and quantum physics over the previous night. Her desk will now contain a set of books on time, with a Moron's Guide to Time Travel by Dr. Nick Meyer as the visible book being shown on top. A set of sticky notes on the wall in front of the desk as well as a set of books and papers containing Max's notes on time being scattered on the sofa and the floor in front of the radiator will be visible. Max's webmail and browsing history will also be updated when her laptop is used. If Max had made fun of Victoria in the previous day, Max's social media page will continue to have unflattering pictures of Max's face superimposed on a sheep and a monkey. In addition, the photo of Victoria covered in paint is visible on top of the book and music shelf next to the desk and can be looked at.

Inside the chest of drawers by the end of the bed, a set of Mystic: Enchantment Cards will be there instead. In one of the drawers in Max's wardrobe, a wristwatch will be there instead.

A timetable on the school schedule for the week at the side of the wardrobe can now be interacted with.

The episode will begin with SMS messages from Chloe, prompting Max to take the shower supplies in the wardrobe and exit the room.

After Max has returned to her room after having her shower to look for the book she borrowed from [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md), [The Max Caulfield Photo Memorial Wall](max_s_photo_wall.md) will be vandalized with a threatening message and a threatening photo will be on Max's bed if Max reported [Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md) to [Ray Wells](principal_wells.md) on the previous day. If Max made fun of Victoria in the previous day, Max's mirror will be vandalized and the room will be in a mess. If Max rearranged the photos in [Victoria's Room](victoria_s_room.md) the previous day, the box of chocolate coconut bites will be gone in her room. Otherwise, the room will be left intact.

## Episode Three - "[Episode 3: Chaos Theory](chaos_theory.md)" 

That evening on the same day, Kate's caged [Alice the Rabbit](rabbit.md) and carrot supply will be in one corner of Max's room next to the window. A floor lamp next to the rabbit can now be switched on and off. Max may also look at her plant Lisa and look outside the window. The glass of soda that Max placed aside in the previous episode to obtain a book is now empty with absorbent tissue placed underneath to prevent water droplets from damaging the papers underneath.

Max's browsing history will be updated again when her laptop is used. There is a news article on Kate's suicide attempt, a list of reported missing persons from Arcadia Bay police department, Kate and Max's social media profile pages and a page on reinstating [Mark Jefferson](mark_jefferson.md) or getting [David Madsen](david_madsen.md) fired from his job at Blackwell if Max blamed Mark Jefferson or got David Madsen placed on temporary leave for Kate's suicide attempt.

If Max had made fun of Victoria in the previous day, the writing on the mirror will be wiped with faint ink patches left.

Inside the chest of drawers by the end of the bed, Max's photography class photo will be there instead.

The episode will begin with two SMS messages from Chloe, prompting Max to wake up and exit the room.

## Episode Five - "[Episode 5: Polarized](polarized.md)" 
Max will return to her room after focusing on her winning selfie. The area where she can move is very limited, but Max's belongings can be seen inside boxes. The Photo Memorial Wall is arranged, but the other walls are still bare. Max's computer can be seen on a chair.

She leaves the room after tearing her photo.
