Here is a section of the wiki page for Chloe's Truck:

## Episode Four - "[Episode 4: Dark Room](dark_room.md)" 
Max and Chloe use the truck to drive to the [hospital](hospital.md) if [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md) is alive. They drive towards Blackwell Academy after visiting Kate there or directly if she is not alive. After finding evidence about Nathan, they use the truck to get to the [beach](beach.md) to ask Frank about Rachel. With Frank's logbook, they drive back to [Madsen Household](chloe_s_house.md) and piece together their clues. With the clues, they find the location of the [Prescott Barn](prescott_barn.md) and head there in Chloe's truck. They find a folder in the [Dark Room (Location)](dark_room.md), which leads Chloe to believe that Nathan is involved with Rachel and suggests Rachel's body location. They drive in the truck to the junkyard to check for Rachel's body and after finding it, drive to the [End of the World Party](end_of_the_world_party.md) to find Nathan, who Chloe thinks killed Rachel. After failing to find him at the party, Chloe gets a text suggesting that Nathan wants to make Rachel's body disappear, which causes Chloe and Max to drive to the junkyard again.

## Episode Five - "[Episode 5: Polarized](polarized.md)" 
Chloe's truck appears as the first frozen moment in the [Max and Chloe](max_and_chloe.md) museum sequence of [Max's Nightmare](max_s_nightmare.md). Similarly, to the first episode, Max is examining her broken camera and Chloe is looking at her.

If Max chooses to sacrifice Arcadia Bay, she and Chloe can be seen leaving town in the truck to an unknown location.

## Alternative Timeline 
In the [Alternative Timeline](alternative_timeline.md), Chloe gets a red SUV on her 16th birthday from [William Price](william_price.md) and [Joyce Price](joyce_price.md). She is later involved in a car crash, leading her to be paralyzed.

## Theories 
*When Max attends the parking lot to give Warren his flash drive back in Episode 1, she can explore this area before she interacts with him. Chloe is neither inside nor anywhere near her truck on the parking lot (Max does not yet know that the old rusted truck belongs to Chloe). It is possible that Chloe ran directly to Frank's RV after the scare in the bathroom with Nathan pointing a gun at her, because there are Rachel Amber Missing posters scattered along the ground from Blackwell's main entrance that lead off in the direction of the parking lot.
