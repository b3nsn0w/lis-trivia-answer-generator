## Episode Three - "[Episode 3: Chaos Theory](chaos_theory.md)" 
In this episode, [Chloe Price](chloe.md) and [Maxine Caulfield](max.md) break into the pool by stealing keys from [Raymond Wells](principal_wells.md)' secretary's office. Max can explore both locker rooms, no matter which one she chooses to enter originally. She can also change names on a list for the Vortex Club party, located at the back of the pool behind some equipment, near the back emergency exit. After turning on the lights in the coach's office, Chloe and Max take a dip in the pool together. Once finished with their midnight dip, the girls dry off and get dressed just in time to evade [David Madsen](david.md) or a security guard, who is investigating the break-in. Max and Chloe escape and take off to Chloe's house in [Chloe's Truck](her_truck.md).

## Episode Four - "[Episode 4: Dark Room](dark_room.md)" 
The "End of the World" party, organized by the Vortex Club, takes place at the Blackwell swimming pool. Max and Chloe visit it together, looking for [Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md).
