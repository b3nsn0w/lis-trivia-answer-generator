## Unrewindable Actions 
[File:Unrewindable.png](thumb.md)
There are some situations or instances throughout the game where Max cannot use her rewind powers and therefore makes decisions she has to live with as the game progresses.
*In [Episode 2: Out of Time](episode_2.md), Max cannot rewind on the rooftop with Kate, because she presumably used all her energy to freeze time in order to get to Kate.
*In [Episode 4: Dark Room](episode_4.md), Jefferson injects Max's neck with a syringe filled with a drug, making her unconscious and unable to rewind time while being unconscious.

## Forced Rewinds 
[File:ForcedRewind.png](thumb.md)
Throughout the game, there are multiple instances where Max is forced to rewind because either she and or a person that she careâ€™s about nearby is in a life-threatening situation, or Max is required to do something specific in order to progress further. During such moments, Max's surroundings will freeze and the screen will become desaturated.
