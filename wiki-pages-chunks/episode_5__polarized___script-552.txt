## '''-Chloe's House-'*

*Max looks over at the plastic lighthouse next to her. The camera zooms out, and Max realizes she is stuck in the snow globe on Chloe's mantelpiece.*

*'William and Chloe's Conversation**

**William:''' Don't you dare question the chef.

**Chloe:** Right, like you're the real cook here.

**William:** I am when your mom is away.

**Chloe:** I'll let her know that.

*The phone rings and William answers.*

'''William and Joyce's Conversation**

**William:''' Hello? Hey, honey... just making a fabulous breakfast with Chloe and Max. We're all going to work at the Two Whales... What? Oh, I didn't know you had to get groceries. Of course I'll come pick you up. Now I have an excuse to get a mocha. Be there shortly. Love you...

*William hangs up.*

**William:** Excuse me, ladies, I have to go rescue yonder Queen at the Sav-Mart. She doth have many bags of delicious grub for us to feast upon.

**Chloe:** You are ridiculous.

**William:** You'll be grateful for that someday. Shit, where are my keys?

*William searches around the room.*

**Chloe:** That's a dollar for the swear jar!

**William:** You mean your college fund...

*There is a flash of light and a 13-year-old Max appears in front of the fireplace. She burns the polaroid that William took of Max and Chloe.*

**William:** Keys, please... Shit, where are those keys?

**Chloe:** Another dollar for the swear jar!

**William:** You're bankrupting me!

*William finds the keys under a hat on the coffee table.*

**William:** A-ha! You can't hide from me forever!

*There is another flash of light and the 13-year-old Max disappears.*

**William:** Now lock up after I leave, play nice, try not to destroy too much of the house.

**William (SMS):** Hey Max, would you say hi to Chloe and Joyce? Don't forget to remind them that you let me die.

**William:** And no Chloe and Max wine-tasting session...

**Chloe:** Dad!
