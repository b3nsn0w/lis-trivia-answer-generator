: ''For Chloe's dreams in [Life is Strange: Before the Storm](before_the_storm.md), see here: [Chloe's Dreams](chloe_s_dreams.md)*

> There is nothing like the sense of relief after waking up from a vivid nightmare. Despite all the terrible things that have been happening this past week, I felt so free and hopeful when I finally woke up. And my nightmare was so obvious... all my fears about being an artist, about my rewind power, and, of course, about my partner in crime and time, Chloe Price..

**Max Caulfield in "[Episode 5: Polarized**, Polarized](episode_5__polarized____polarized.md)"

In "[Episode 5: Polarized](polarized.md)", the fifth episode of *[Life is Strange](life_is_strange.md)'', [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) has a** **strange** nightmare**. This occurs after reuniting with [Chloe Price](chloe_price.md) at the [beach](beach.md), shortly after rewinding and convincing her not to enter the [End of the World Party](end_of_the_world_party.md). This nightmare is a reflection of all events of the week and Max's decisions, and depicts Max's feelings, especially her doubts, fears, insecurities, and feelings of guilt. Max is constantly confronted with the consequences of her choices and is accused of doing the wrong things by all appearing characters. Every important location of the week is revisited, and all characters Max met are featured in some way, especially the most important ones. It also sets a focus on [Max and Chloe](max_and_chloe.md)'s relationship, and their key moments in every episode.

## Sequences 

#

## Jefferson's Class 
Max sits through the same lecture from the beginning of the game, believing she is in a time loop. However, during the lesson the windows become slowly splattered with blood from dead birds hitting them. Nobody else in the classroom notices this. Suddenly the room is empty, and the windows are clear once again. Depending on Max's success in saving [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md), the place where she normally would sit is either splashed with blood or full of "I WANT TO DIE" scribbles. Max can pick up the note that was thrown at Kate, but this time it reads,

''"Max, if you're reading this, it means you're DEAD*

*Mr. Jefferson, xoxo"''

Looking out the window, Max notices dozens of dead birds lying in front of the school building. Pictures and posters in the room have changed now depicting Max in disturbing ways. The "Rachel Amber ♥ 4 ever" mark changes to "Max Caulfield ♥ 4 ever" and then "Chloe Price ♥ 4 ever" after looking at it. Max can take an [Optional Photos](optional_photo.md) of the scratches. She then wanders to the door as in the [Episode 1: Chrysalis](first_episode.md). [Mark Jefferson](jefferson.md) appears and calls her. Max is forced into a conversation with him, in which they uncomfortably discuss the events that happened in the [Dark Room (Location)](dark_room.md), and Max is forced to answer with inappropriate responses.

After the conversation, he disappears and Max can leave the room. She then finds herself, not in the [Blackwell Academy Hallway](corridor_of_blackwell.md), but in the hallway of the girl's side of the [Prescott Dormitory](prescott_dormitory.md).

#

## Dormitory Hall 
Max is confronted with walking down the hallway of the Dormitory towards Kate Marsh. When Max talks to her, she is abusive and blames Max for her suicide attempt. She opens her dorm room door and falls through. As it closes behind her, Max can follow. She ends up once again in the dormitory hallway. This time however, a key with a room number is visible and may be picked up on a bench by the shower room door. By looking at the number at each door and by referring to the dormitory map directory, the room number on the key is referring to [Dana's Room](dana_s_room.md). After opening Dana's room, she goes through and again finds herself at the entrance to the hallway.

This time, she is dressed in [Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md)'s clothes and the dormitory map directory will have some changes to some of the room occupants, listing Rachel Amber among the inhabitants. Max must enter through the first doorway on the left in order to progress; Rachel stayed there when she was at Blackwell. Max finds herself transformed into Victoria this time, and enters through [Victoria's Room](victoria_s_dorm_room.md) door to move on. One last time, she finds herself at the beginning of the hallways which are now covered in polaroids, while all the slates read "LOOK AT ME: I AM MAX SELFIE!". Max heads to her own room and finally enters it to appear in the hallway of Blackwell Academy.

#

## [Blackwell Academy](blackwell_academy.md) 
Max finds herself in the same setting as in the first episode in the hallway. Everything in this sequence of the nightmare is backwards. Max's speech is in reverse, as well as the actions of the characters in the scene. Max moves forward as she does in Episode 1, and puts in her earphones to listen to the now reversed soundtrack of "[To All of You](to_all_of_you.md)" by Syd Matters. Max then walks down towards the bathroom, following the spirit [doe](doe.md) at the end of the corridor. Near the entrance of the bathroom, the [Science Lab](science_lab.md) skeleton with an e-cigarette on its mouth will be propped up in one corner of the common area. Upon going near the science lab skeleton, an optional photo icon will appear on the bottom right corner of the screen. Max has to press the "Open Journal" button (Tab on PC) to take a reversed optional photo of the skeleton.
