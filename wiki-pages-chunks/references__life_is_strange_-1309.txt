Here is a section of the wiki page for References (Life is Strange):

## Prescott Dormitory 
* While studying quantum physics and time travel, Max makes several references to well-known time travel theories including {{Wiki|Schrödinger's Cat}}, {{Wiki|Stephen Hawking}}'s {{Wiki|Time_travel#Tourism_in_time|Tourism in Time}} and the {{Wiki|Quantum entanglement|Quantum Entanglement}}.
* [File:Max_room_paradox_book.png](right.md) The "Theory, Paradoxes & Possibilities" book seen on the floor of Max's room in this episode could perhaps be based on a 2013 [https://www.space.com/21675-time-travel.html online article] about time travel, which is titled, "Time Travel: Theories, Paradoxes & Possibilities". (The two white lines that sit above the "Theory, Paradoxes & Possibilities" title on Max's book could be an artistic representation of the two words, "time travel", as text is commonly represented on the game textures by way of bars and squiggles.)
* On Max's request, Warren listed some time travel films in an email including *{{Wiki|The Time Machine (1960 film)|The Time Machine (1960)}}*, *{{Wiki|Primer (film)|Primer}}*, *{{Wiki|Time After Time (1979_film)|Time After Time}}*, *{{Wiki|Pulp Fiction}}*, *{{Wiki|Somewhere in Time (film)|Somewhere in Time}}*, *{{Wiki|G.I. Samurai|Time Slip/G.I. Samurai}}*, *{{Wiki|Timecop}}.*
* On Max's table, there is a book called "The Moron’s Guide to Time Travel” by Nick Meyer. The author's name “Nick Meyer” is a reference to {{Wiki|Nicholas Meyer}}, the director of the 1979 time travel film *Time After Time*.
* Warren's email account icon is a picture of the {{Wiki|TARDIS}}, the time machine in the British time travel series *{{Wiki|Doctor Who}}*. He also refers to himself as "The Doctor", the protagonist of the series, in his email and text messages.
* Warren mentions *{{Wiki|Back to the Future}}* in his email to Max. After her request regarding information on relativity, wormholes and time travel, he texts Max if he's now Doctor Who or {{Wiki|Emmett_Brown|Doc Brown}} and that "he'll be in the TARDIS getting his {{Wiki|DeLorean time machine|DeLorean}} ready", again referring to *Doctor Who* and *Back to the Future*.
* In her Halloween party invitation email, Dana refers to herself as "Dana of the Dead", in reference to the zombie horror movie *{{Wiki|Dawn of the Dead (2004_film)|Dawn of the Dead}}*.
* When Max waters Lisa the Plant, she says, “Drink up… it’s got electrolytes”. The quote is a reference to the film *{{Wiki|Idiocracy}}*.
*There's a pack of Mystic Enchantment cards in Max's drawer; a reference to the popular trading card game {{Wiki|Magic: The Gathering|Magic}}.
*When looking at her guitar, Max says, "Meanwhile, my guitar gently sleeps", which is a reference to the Beatles song *While My Guitar Gently Weeps*.
* After warning [Alyssa Anderson](alyssa_anderson.md) about the toilet paper in the hall of the girls’ dormitory, she asks Max what her favorite science-fiction film is. The player has the choice of choosing between *Back to the Future*, *{{Wiki|Looper (film)|Looper}}* and *{{Wiki|Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day}}* when answering Alyssa.
* Kate's book, *The October Country* by Ray Bradbury, comprises 19 short stories that often deal with macabre themes, celebrity pressures and end in death, paralleling Kate Marsh's situation with the viral video and her suicide.
*Max suggests that Kate is in her {{Wiki|H.R. Giger}} period upon seeing Kate's recent dark-themed drawings.
* If the player chose to make fun of Victoria, Max's room will be trashed and vandalized. On the ground, nearest to her radio, is a ruined copy of *{{Wiki|Donnie Darko}}*.

## Dormitory Grounds 
* When attempting to get the second photograph achievement, "Full Exposure", Max likens the squirrel she lures out of into the open with a doughnut to the Kraken. The {{Wiki|Kraken}} is a mythological creature of Scandinavian origin, recently popularized by the 2006 and 2010 films ''{{Wiki|Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest}}* and the remake of the *{{Wiki|Clash of the Titans (2010 film)|Clash of the Titans}}''. By shouting "Release the kraken!" she makes reference to the popular meme.
* Warren's t-shirt in this episode contains a cartoon drawing of a box and a "meow!" bubble speech imposed above it, a reference to the Schrödinger's cat theory. He later texts Max and declares "he's no Schrödinger's kitty".
* Warren mentions that the drive-in at Newport is showing a *{{Wiki|Planet of the Apes}}* film marathon.
* When Max declines Warren's invitation to the drive-in, he makes a joke about her being a "damn dirty human", in reference to the quote "damn dirty ape" from *Planet of the Apes*.

## Blackwell Academy Bus 
[File:Orca.jpg](thumb.md)
While Max is riding the bus, two boats can be seen on the left side of the main road. One of these boats is named "The Orca", which is likely a reference to the boat of the same name in the movie Jaws (which is theme alluded later in the game).
