Chloe was alive)# (Max told David that Chloe was alive)
**Max:** You should have seen how relieved he was when I lied to him and told him you didn't die. It would have crushed him...

}}

**Chloe:** Are you serious? I can't see him showing any feeling... except towards my mom...

|-|David saved me.David saved me.
**Max:** Chloe, David saved me from Jefferson... If he didn't track down the Dark Room... I'd be dead right now.

**Chloe:** Max... I had no clue... I should have been the one to save you, but... I'm so grateful David was there.

|-|David was ahead of us.# David was ahead of us.
**Max:** David was already investigating Jefferson. He was way ahead of us...

**Chloe:** Except that he was actually investigating everybody, Max... including your friend Kate. Sorry, but I still don't trust him. It's up to us, Max.

**Max:** No, no, listen to me... wait, Chloe! Chloe!

*Max is forced to rewind.*

**Chloe:** So what's your plan?

**Max:** We tell him everything, including that Victoria is in danger.

**Chloe:** Okay. You've been through so much... I believe you, Max. After all, I'm still your faithful companion.

**Max:** Yes, you are. So, listen... In a few minutes, I won't know any of this happened... nothing. We absolutely have to stay in your room and do nothing. Then we explain everything to David, and we finally let him do his job. You'll have to tell me exactly what I did and said just now. Just explain that I traveled through time using the photo.

**Chloe:** Will you believe me?

**Max:** Iâ€™ll always believe you, Chloe.

*Max looks around. Chloe is standing in front of her, watching the tornado.*

**Max:** Oh, Chloe!

*Max runs up to Chloe and hugs her tightly.*

**Chloe:** *[turning around]* I see that the real Max is back... So, how was your time trip, dude?

**Max:** Shut up. Oh, you're alive! You're alive, oh... Both of us! I did so much to bring you back, Chloe... and it worked. It actually worked. You're with me again.

**Chloe:** *[hugging Max]* It looks like even fate doesn't want us apart. And... you traveled through multiple realities just to... save my ungrateful ass over and over. I hope it was worth it, but... I don't blame you for wanting me out of your life, after all my drama.

**Max:** Come on. I'm the official Drama King and Queen of Arcadia Bay this week. Just look at what my powers have caused in... just a short time. I mean... I'm nobody.

**Chloe:** You're Max-fucking-Caulfield, Time Warrior. Even if you weren't, you're kind and caring. Nobody could have a better best friend... Nobody. You didn't ask for any of this to happen, but it did. You need to accept how awesome you are.

**Max:** Maybe I willed it subconsciously, or something. I always wanted my life to be special... an adventure... but not without you. And it didn't happen until I moved back here, so... without you, my powers wouldn't even exist.

**Chloe:** Then for whatever scientific, mystical reason, that we'll obviously never figure out... We were meant to be together at this exact moment in history. I have to think that Rachel was somewhere behind the scenes, fighting for justice...

**Max:** I'd like to think that, too... We all owe Rachel Amber. Now tell me everything that happened. You... You remember, right?

**Chloe:** Well, we... we left the party and made sure Jefferson couldn't find us. For once, I was glad I lived in an actual fortress. Then the storm got hella crazy and... and you said we would be safe at the lighthouse.

**Max:** Chloe, look! The storm is getting bigger now. It's coming closer. I... I can't even believe this is real, but this is happening because of me.

**Chloe:** Stop it! Stop beating yourself up, okay? We've both paid our dues already on that. Oh, God, look at that! Look at that monster! Who knows... This could be Rachel's revenge... Our revenge. The lighthouse is out of the way of the tornado. Come on!

**Max:** Oh... What... Chloe... ''[Max collapses in Chloe's arms]''

**Chloe:** I've got your back, Max.
