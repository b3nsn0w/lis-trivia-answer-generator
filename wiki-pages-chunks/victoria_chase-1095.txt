Here is a section of the wiki page for Victoria Chase:

## Enemies 
*[Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md) - Victoria is seen bullying Kate about her video at various points in the game. She spread Kate's video in Blackwell and even built up a homepage. Along with Mark Jefferson and Nathan Prescott, she can be considered one of the main people responsible for Kate's suicide attempt. Despite all this, given Kate survived her suicide attempt, Victoria sends her a letter offering her help and even dedicates her Everyday Hero Contest prize to Kate. Kate acknowledges that she really struggles with her guilt and, despite her mean behavior, is actually insecure about herself, and so decides to forgive her.
*[Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md) - They hung out together frequently in the Vortex Club. It's known that she respected her but despite her disappearance is still very resentful towards her, as she vandalized on one of her Missing Person's Posters and made negative writings about her on the girls' bathroom's walls. It's possible that this is due to Rachel having been in a (sexual) relationship with Mr. Jefferson who Victoria seems to have a crush on.
*[Juliet Watson](juliet_watson.md) - Victoria antagonizes Juliet in response to an article criticizing Victoria and exposing her for bullying at Blackwell, written by Juliet. The two already were at odds prior to the game because of thisThere is a sent email on Victoria's laptop that Max cannot read, but a subject line of "Juliet and her gazette..." is visible. and the fact that Juliet "stole" Zachary from Victoria, whom Victoria seemingly was interested in before Juliet and Zachary became a couple. As an act of revenge, Victoria mentioned to Juliet that her best friend Dana was sexting with Zachary (indicating, that on Juliet's' part, she considered Victoria a friend and even trusted her over Dana), while secretly she was sexting with him herself, trying to sabotage Juliet and Dana's friendship and Juliet and Zachary's relationship. After finding out the truth, Juliet is devastated and feels betrayed by both Zachary and Victoria in the parking lot. Though, in Episode 2, Juliet reveals she is planning revenge on Victoria.
*[Chloe Price](chloe_price.md) - Chloe appears to know of Victoria outside of Max's interactions with her. If Max mocks Victoria (and takes her picture), Chloe will call Victoria a skank and say "karma is a bitch", indicating that she was not on good terms with her. In Episode 4, Chloe is not surprised when Victoria wins the Everyday Heroes Photo Contest through means of blackmail.
*[Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) (**Determinant**) - Victoria was jealous of Max having her own unique identity in the retro zone, Max's own popularity as well as Max's attempts to impress Mark Jefferson in class whom Victoria has a crush on, and whom Victoria is under a lot of pressure from her family to perform well in her studies as well as to get her photo entry to win in the Everyday Heroes contest. Victoria will attempt to block Max from entering the Blackwell dormitory with her friends Taylor and Courtney and take a photo of Max to taunt and insult Max. When Victoria gets splashed with sprinkler water and wet paint after Max tampers with the sprinkler water systems and paint can handle, Max has the option to comfort or make fun of Victoria. If Max comforts Victoria, Victoria will be less hostile towards Max and will delete the photo of Max and leave Max's social media profile page and Max's room mostly untouched. Victoria will also be more likely to believe Max warning her about Nathan much later on. If Max makes fun of Victoria, Victoria will also post unflattering images of Max on her social media profile calling Max a hipster, vandalize the mirror in Max's room and ransack Max's room itself to search and get back the photo of Victoria covered in paint. Victoria will also not believe Max warning her about Nathan much later on. If Max re-arranges the photos in Victoria's room while searching for evidence to help convince Juliet to unlock the door to Dana's room, Victoria will also steal Max's box of coconut bites and vandalize the slate outside Max's room.
*[Mark Jefferson](mark_jefferson.md) (**Determinant**) - If Max warns Victoria about Nathan, and she believes her, Victoria will go to Mark Jefferson to seek for help, but she is captured by Jefferson and is placed in the Dark Room with Max. He eventually decides to kill her as she knew too much.
