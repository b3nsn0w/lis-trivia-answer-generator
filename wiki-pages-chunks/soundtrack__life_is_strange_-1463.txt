## Trivia 
[File:Pirate Disk.png](thumb.md)
* The cover art for the Soundtrack CD is based on the cover of a mix tape Max made for Chloe when she was 12. You can find it in a drawer in Alternative Chloe's room in "[Episode 4: Dark Room](dark_room.md)".
* There is an extremely rare Vinyl version.[http://na.square-enix.com/us/blog/life-strange-vinyl-soundtrack-sweepstakes Life is Strange Vinyl Soundtrack Sweepstakes]
 Only a few these vinyls were created as promotional materials for *Life is Strange*, though (like the licensed soundtrack) they aren't sold commercially. Originally it was part of an official give away, later you could win it during Square Enix [:Category:Livestreams](livestreams.md) and it was available as a prize during some fan contest like the *Life is Strange Fans* community's contests[http://lifeisstrangefans.com/competitions/christmas-contest/ Life Is Strange Christmas Multimedia Contest] and other giveaways[http://lifeisstrange-blog.tumblr.com/post/154684797850/and-the-2016-life-is-strange-community-heroes Community Heroes] (December 19, 2016). You can only get it as a Reward on the [https://store.na.square-enix.com/product/294295/life-is-strange-soundtrack-2-vinyl-record-set-reward official Square Enix shop] by using *EPts* you receive for buying *Square Enix* products.[File:VYNIL.jpg](thumb.md)
