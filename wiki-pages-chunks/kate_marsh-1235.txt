Here is a section of the wiki page for Kate Marsh:

## Background 
[File:Kate's Family.png](thumb.md)
Kate was born into a heavily Christian conservative family and is devoted to the religion. Her father [Richard Marsh](richard_marsh.md) is a preacher in the Church, who she seems to have a good relationship with. She has two younger sisters, one of them the 10-year-old [Lynn Marsh](lynn_marsh.md). She seems to have a positive relationship with them as well.

She started attending Blackwell Academy in September, 2013.

She doesn't drink alcohol and wages an abstinence campaign at her school, although she has a few sips of wine in church.

Before the release of her viral video, Kate was a happy student at Blackwell with a high GPA of 3.9 and a spotless record. She's considered a representative of the very best students at Blackwell. Her extracurricular activities include the Meals On Wheels program and a diverse religious studies group.This is evident through her Blackwell Academy record.

She became friends with Max during her first month at Blackwell and they met regularly to drink tea together. They even started to have weekly tea sessions.

Max comments that Kate's original drawings would be perfect for a children's book; so there is the possibility that Kate had aspired to have a career in published works. Kate's creative side also shines through her love of music; she plays the violin (usually every morning), and enjoys the works of Mozart.This is evident from the Mozart poster in her room in Episode 2

Kate is traumatized by an experience she had at a Vortex Club party on October the 4thThis is evident from David's clues which include photos and location data cross-referencing the time of Kate's abduction with both Jefferson's and Nathan's vehicles on the evening of the 4th of October., in which Nathan Prescott drugged her and promised he would take her to a hospital for help (an act which he did not follow through on). Kate was caught on camera kissing several strangers, and recalls none of it due to the drugs. Kate later woke up outside her dorm room, stating she wasn't physically hurt but she felt gross (implying Nathan sexually assaulted her).She reveals this information to Max in [Episode 2: Out of Time](episode_2.md). [Victoria Chase](victoria_chase.md) published the video online and spread the news of the video throughout Blackwell.

Following the incident, she consulted the [An-Marie Barenchi](school_nurse.md) who, concerned about Kate's current mental state, contacted [Raymond Wells](principal_wells.md) to keep an eye on her. She also informed him about her suspicions regarding a possible mobbing, though this warning was evidently ignored.This is evident through a note attached to her Blackwell Academy record.

When word of her video reached her family, her mother expressed disappointment at her behavior and lack of adherence to her Christian upbringing. Her family's disappointment combined with the persistent bullying from Vortex Club members and the vicious behavior of her peers leads her to become withdrawn and depressed.

Before the events of the Vortex Party, Kate was good friends with [Alyssa Anderson](alyssa_anderson.md) and [Stella Hill](stella_hill.md); something which Max was oblivious to.There is a photograph of the three girls together in Kate's bedroom.

She has a black and white pet bunny named [Alice the Rabbit](alice.md) in her dorm room.

## Episode One - "[Episode 1: Chrysalis](chrysalis.md)" 
Kate sits at the table to the right of Max in Jefferson's classroom. She is teased by [Taylor Christensen](taylor_christensen.md), who throws a paper ball at her and comments about her "porn video". If Max speaks with her after failing to answer Jefferson's question, she worries that she embarrassed Kate by not knowing the answer. Kate asks to spend time with Max later on. Max can inspect Kate's notes at her table; upon closer inspection, it seems she is having depressing, suicidal thoughts. Drawings of nooses and the word "waste" adorn the page.

On the grounds of the [Prescott Dormitory](prescott_dormitory.md), Kate sits looking off into the distance alone on a bench. She asks Max to leave her alone for a while so she can think; she is clearly thinking about her reputation after the viral video she was involved in.

Outside Kate's room, Max can remove the mean message written on her slate "Will bang 4 Jesus". Instead, she can replace it with a peace sign.

Upon leaving the dorm to meet Warren, Max finds Kate being harassed by [David Madsen](david_madsen.md).

Intervene# Intervene David becomes enraged at Max for interfering in official Blackwell business, saying he "will remember this conversation". However, he walks away leaving Kate alone, and she thanks you for your intervention.
|-|Take the photoTake the photo David walks away without noticing that you took a photo for proof of his actions, Kate is distressed by your lack of intervention and leaves, upset. 

As Max searches through [David's Garage](david_s_garage.md) for tools to fix her camera, she can happen upon David's files. It's clear he's been spying on Kate, taking photos and creating a file for her.

When Max discovers that Chloe was drugged by Nathan Prescott, she assumes that the same thing happened to Kate due to her strange, uncharacteristic behavior in the viral video.

At the end of the episode, Kate is seen crying in her room during the snowstorm.
