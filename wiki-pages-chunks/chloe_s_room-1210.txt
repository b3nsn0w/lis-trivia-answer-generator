* The soda cans in Chloe's room are a brand called "Pr. Amaury", a reference to [Amaury Balandier](amaury_balandier.md), the lead environment artist for *Life is Strange*. They're also referencing the soft drink brand Dr. Pepper.
* There is a postcard that can be found in the metalbox under Chloe's bed. Once enlarged, it appears the letter was from someone called "Amaury", probably another reference to Amaury Balandier.
* An unused audio file in Episode 3 ("Chaos Theory") revealed that the snow doe that sits on the mantelpiece in the 2008 Price household (which Chloe keeps in her room in 2013 - both timelines) actually belonged to William. {{Headphones|file=Snow-doe-William.ogg}}
