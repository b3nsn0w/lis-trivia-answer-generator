Here is a section of the wiki page for Life is Strange:

## Early Development 
The development of *Life is Strange* took place over the span of three years, starting circa in April 2013.[https://www.instagram.com/p/tpS23ynCCX/ Ask DONTNOD 4] During the first year of development, it wasn’t the main project at DONTNOD Entertainment so they only had a small team of around fifteen people working on the prototype of the game.[http://www.momenta.online/2016/02/edouard-caplain-on-the-art-behind-life-is-strange/ Edouard Caplain on the Art Behind Life Is Strange] (February 9, 2016)

DONTNOD Entertainment considered over a hundred different names for *Life is Strange*. *What If?* originally was the game's working title, while *Life is Strange* was only supposed to be the title of the [Episode 1: Chrysalis](first_episode.md).[https://www.hautbasgauchedroite.fr/fr/podcast/228/P226-le-role-du-scenario-et-du-scenariste-dans-le-developpement-d-un-jeu #226 - Le rôle du scénariste dans le développement d'un jeu (Life is Strange) et l'évolution du scénario dans le temps]
*What If* was discarded as because a Daniel Radcliffe film of the same name had been released in 2013 and 2014 earlier.

When they started to work on the game, they couldn't imagine how successful the game would turn out to be. They merely focused on what kind of story they were passionate to tell, and disregarded factors such as target audience and marketing.

In the development diary, "A New Beginning", DONTNOD Entertainment's developers state that every publisher except Square Enix asked them to make their protagonists male instead of female. Before being accepted by Square Enix, seven different publishers rejected the game, mainly for the reasons mentioned above.[https://www.hautbasgauchedroite.fr/fr/podcast/228/P226-le-role-du-scenario-et-du-scenariste-dans-le-developpement-d-un-jeu #226 - Le rôle du scénariste dans le développement d'un jeu (Life is Strange) et l'évolution du scénario dans le temps]

At the time, most prospective publishers were unwilling to publish the game unless it featured more action sequences[https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-s-life-is-strange-considered-100-diffe/1100-6425742/ Square Enix's Life is Strange Considered 100 Different Names] (March 6, 2015) or had a male protagonist due to "little sales potential"[https://www.gamespot.com/articles/other-publishers-told-us-to-make-it-a-male-lead-ch/1100-6424577/ "Other Publishers Told Us to Make It a Male Lead Character," Life is Strange Dev Says] (January 10, 2015)[https://v1.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/139401-Publishers-Disliked-Dontnods-Life-is-Strange-Having-Female-Leads Publishers Wanted Life is Strange Devs to Make Leads Male] (January 11, 2015), a problem they had already faced with their first title, *Remember Me*.[https://www.gamespot.com/articles/publishers-said-you-cant-have-a-female-character-says-remember-me-dev/1100-6405550/ Publishers said 'You can't have a female character,' says Remember Me dev] (March 19, 2013) CEO Oskar Guilbert had also challenged the idea at the start.Barnes, Ben (June 2016). "Edge #293". Edge. p. 94-97: Future plc. Square Enix, who loved the game's storytelling element, was the only publisher that that supported the project with no intention to change it. Originally, Dontnod had pitched a larger game to Square Enix that the publisher was not interested in, whereupon Dontnod chose to present their smaller narrative project *Life is Strange*.[https://www.mcvuk.com/business-news/they-originally-pitched-a-different-game-how-square-enix-discovered-life-is-strange/ ‘They originally pitched a different game’: how Square Enix discovered Life Is Strange] (August 7, 2015) 

The team's size would eventually grow up to a number of 40 people working on the team.[http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-09-10-life-is-strange-it-takes-time-to-be-different Life is Strange: It takes time to be different] (December 9, 2014)

*Life is Strange* was composed as a self-contained story. After the release of the final episode, Co-Director [Michel Koch](michel_koch.md) explained that they told the story about Max and Chloe that they had planned from the beginning in the course of five episodes and that their story was done. Prior to the release of *[Life is Strange 2](life_is_strange_2.md)*, Koch reconfirmed that the story of Max and Chloe was done and that Dontnod wanted players to imagine what happened after the endings on their own.[https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-08-21-life-is-strange-2 Why Life is Strange 2 is ditching Arcadia Bay for its radically different roadtrip] (August 21, 2018)
