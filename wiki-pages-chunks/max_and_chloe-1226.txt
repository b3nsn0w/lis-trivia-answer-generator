[File:Maxandchloe-main.png](thumb.md)
This article is meant to give a deeper and more detailed look at the relationship between [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) and [Chloe Price](chloe_price.md) and its development throughout the *[Life is Strange](life_is_strange.md)* franchise. Max and Chloe are childhood best friends who fell out of touch after Max moved with her parents to [Seattle](seattle.md) and rekindle their friendship during the events of the original game. They are long-time friends, regardless of Max's choices.

The prequel game, *[Life is Strange: Before the Storm](before_the_storm.md)*, is set three years prior to the events of the main game and explores how Chloe deals with the separation from her best friend and tries to move on.

In *[Life is Strange 2](life_is_strange_2.md)*, in [Episode 5: Wolves](episode_5.md), if a player had sacrificed [Arcadia Bay](arcadia_bay.md) to save Chloe in the original game, Max and Chloe will be seen in a photograph inside a trailer that belongs to Chloe's step-father, [David Madsen (Life is Strange 2)](david_madsen.md).

In *[Life is Strange: True Colors](life_is_strange__true_colors.md),* in the bonus story [Wavelengths](wavelengths.md), if Arcadia Bay was sacrificed in the first game, Max and Chloe will be mentioned by [Steph Gingrich (True Colors)](steph_gingrich.md).

## Background 
[File:Max and Chloe 12.png](thumb.md) Max and Chloe have been friends since childhood and lived half a mile from each other.Max: "To think I lived just half a mile away..." ([Episode 1: Chrysalis](episode_1.md) - Joyce's room, Chloe's house.) Max used to spend a lot of time at [Madsen Household](chloe_s_house.md), where the two would often play pirates by dressing up and pretending the living room couch is a pirate ship. Chloe's father, [William Price](william_price.md), would occasionally entertain them by hosting barbecues in the backyard and kept a height chart in [Chloe's Room](chloe_s_room.md). The two also enjoyed watching TV shows, such as *{{Wiki|Spongebob}}*, *{{Wiki|Power Rangers}}*, ''{{Wiki|Blue's Clues}}* and *{{Wiki|Teletubbies}}'', and they had movie nights and played video games together. They had a tree fort, the location of which Chloe [Media:Note-lighthouse-map.png](marked.md) on the orientation map of [Arcadia Bay](arcadia_bay.md) at the [lighthouse](lighthouse.md) so they would "always be able to find each other in case of emergency." The girls also seem to tag locations where they shared games and adventures, proven by the tree stump engraving at the lighthouse.

In 1999, Chloe's parents bought her a kitten named [Bongo](bongo.md), which would later become part of Max and Chloe's "superhero adventure" drawings. After he got killed by a car, Chloe and Max made a gravestone for him located in Chloe's backyard. Also in the backyard of Chloe's house, there is a swing which Max and Chloe would take turns on when they were little. Chloe liked to fly way up into the air, while Max was scared and always jumped off before falling.Max remembers this if she uses the swing in "[Episode 3: Chaos Theory](chaos_theory.md)". There is also a wooden board decorated by the two girls, although the drawing is now barely visible. This board is later used to sort out the clues in Max and Chloe's investigation on the [:Category:Dark Room Conspiracy](dark_room_conspiracy.md).

In 2008, the girls were having secret "wine-tasting sessions" at Chloe's house, one of which is remembered by Max when she visits Chloe's house for the first time in five years. The wine spilt on the carpet in the dining room had left a stain which couldn't be washed out and remains visible to the present day. (It is likely that this stain was what gave their wine tasting activities away to Chloe's parents.)

At some point in 2008, Max and Chloe were making pancakes together with William at Chloe's house when [Joyce Price](chloe_s_mom.md) called and asked William to pick her up from the [Sav-Mart](grocery_store.md), which led to William's death in a car accident. Although Max was supportive at the time, she soon moved to Seattle with her [:Category:Caulfield Family](parents.md), leaving her best friend and her old life behind. The two fell out of touch until Max's return to Arcadia Bay five years later.Â
