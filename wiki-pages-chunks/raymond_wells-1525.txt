Here is a section of the wiki page for Raymond Wells:

## Episode Two - "[Episode 2: Out of Time](out_of_time.md)" 
The principal is able to be spoken to after Max returns to school following Chloe's train incident. Ray Wells is standing outside his office door, in a distressed manner, and can be spoken to. If Max had spoken to the principal about Nathan's gun incident the previous day, the principal dismisses her accusations and tells Max to focus on her school work. He then mentions that Blackwell is ushering in a new era of surveillance security. When Max attempts to question him about this or [David Madsen](david_madsen.md)'s actions with [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md), the principal further dismisses her by claiming she is on a spree of false accusations. Before Max can say anything else, he claims he has a meeting to attend to and shoos her away.

Later, following Kate's suicide attempt, he will convene a meeting in his office with [Mark Jefferson](mark_jefferson.md), David Madsen, Nathan Prescott, and Max to discuss what happened on the rooftop. Whether Max was successful in saving Kate or not, the principal will want to know from Max every detail about what happened. Depending on who Max blames for causing Kate's suicide attempt, Wells will proceed to punish the accused with varying levels of degree depending on Max's proof. If Max blames Mr. Jefferson, Wells will not let him continue to represent the "Everyday Heroes" contest but will allow him to remain on campus no matter what previous choices Max made. On the other hand, if Max blames David or Nathan, there is a chance that Wells may decide to suspend Max instead if she accused either one without respective evidence and took the blame for Chloe's weed in the last episode, and Wells will see her as untrustworthy. However, if Max had reported Nathan's gun incident in Episode 1, regardless of whether David believes Max to be a "stoner", Nathan will receive a suspension; an action Wells will privately contact Nathan for to apologize and remain on good terms with the Prescotts. As for David, if Max took the picture of David and Kate's argument, Wells will deem it right to not allow him to return to campus for a few days to maintain a good image, which will greatly anger David.

In the ending scenes, he is seen arguing with Mr. Jefferson in his car slightly out of campus grounds. Jefferson will eventually speed off and leave Wells behind on the road.

## Episode Three - "[Episode 3: Chaos Theory](chaos_theory.md)" 
On her way to meet Chloe in front of Blackwell Academy, Max sees Principal Wells, obviously drunk, struggling to open a door of the Prescott Dormitory. Max must sneak around him or he will question what she is doing roaming the grounds at night. Max can mention concerns over Kate Marsh, to which Principal Wells alludes that this is why he is drunk at the time. Ending the conversation, Principal Wells will tell Max to return to her room.

Chloe and Max have the chance to enter and explore Wells' office in the episode.

Aside from finding records of students scattered around the office, they also find some helpful clues leading towards the disappearance of [Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md); most notably a drawing done by Nathan with the words "Rachel in the Dark Room" written repeatedly.

Max can also observe a bottle of whiskey in the corner of Wells' office; implying that he uses alcohol to cope with the stress of his job.

## Episode Four - "[Episode 4: Dark Room](dark_room.md)" 
Despite the fact that Wells is not featured in the following episode, Wells is seen speaking to [Mark Jefferson](mark_jefferson.md) in the [Prescott Dormitory](prescott_dormitory.md) grounds before Chloe and Max enter, which is when he leaves the dormitory.

## Episode Five - "[Episode 5: Polarized](polarized.md)" 
After Max created an alternative timeline where she won the Everyday Heroes contest by turning in her photo to Jefferson and captured him with David's help, Principal Wells took Jefferson's place as the person who would travel with Max to [San Francisco](san_francisco.md). Wells is sitting on Max's right in the [Plane](airplane.md). He is initially sleeping but wakes up when it's time to land and asks Max if he was snoring loudly. They have a short conversation and reminisce the week's events.

After arriving at the [Zeitgeist Gallery](zeitgeist_gallery.md), Max remarks that the gallery is huge, and Wells says the same is true about the buffet. He tells Max that she's no longer a kid and has to act like the photographer she wants to be, using his own past as an example. Before going upstairs to the buffet, Wells says that Max can always come to him for advice.

Max has the opportunity to speak to him on the second floor of the gallery. She tells him that she doesn't feel like a famous photographer, to which Wells replies that every journey starts with the first step and Max has made everyone at Blackwell proud with the response to her work. He admits that he should have been more proactive about Kate's situation and that he probably wouldn't believe Max about Nathan carrying a gun. The conversation then shifts to Mark Jefferson. Wells tells Max that Jefferson had a reputation good enough for nobody to suspect him, and also mentions the fact that he was brought to Blackwell by [Sean Prescott](sean_prescott.md). He tells her that he was fouled by Jefferson because of his weakness for prestige. In the end, Wells just hopes that everything will become normal. He tells Max that she is an adult now and can call him Ray for the event.

Principal Wells is featured in the maze section of [Max's Nightmare](max_s_nightmare.md). He makes comments about his alcoholism over the loudspeakers, and is alerting the school about Max being on the run; he blames her for the deaths of both Rachel and Chloe. He also appears as one of the searchers in the maze scene, wishing he had given Max's scholarship to Victoria, etc. In the diner scene of the nightmare, he says that he hasn't been the best principal, but Max has indeed been the best Everyday Hero.
