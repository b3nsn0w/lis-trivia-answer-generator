## Episodic Format 
DONTNOD purposefully chose the episodic format inspired by TV shows. [https://www.shacknews.com/article/117561/from-chaos-the-aspirational-storytelling-of-life-is-strange?page4#detail-view From Chaos: The Aspirational Storytelling of Life is Strange] (May 13, 2020).

Before signing with Square Enix, *Life is Strange* was imagined as a full-length video game that Dontnod would self-publish. However, the publisher surmised that it would be more successful as an episodic title.Barnes, Ben (June 2016). "Edge #293". Edge. p. 94-97: Future plc. The episodic format, which had become a successful phenomenon through Telltale Games' releases, was adapted due to financial reasons as a "slow risk" approach, as well as marketing and creative reasons, allowing them to tell the story in its preferred slow pace.[https://www.mcvuk.com/business-news/life-is-good-dontnod-on-the-success-of-life-is-strange-and-what-comes-next/ Life is good: Dontnod on the success of Life is Strange and what comes next] (March 15, 2015)[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/26/life-is-strange-episodic-video-game-dontnodLife Is Strange: episodic video games prove as addictive as episodic TV] (April 26, 2015

Developing in episodes which released over the span of a year allowed the studio to adjust their story and some details according to the player feedback they received after each episode.

Game Director [Raoul Barbet](raoul_barbet.md): ''"With a full game that was released all at one time, we wouldn't have been able to have this huge community. (...) The gaps between episodes were times when players could discuss the characters and story. Also, that format helped us focus on characters by filling in blanks. When developers get feedback from players between episodes, we can react and adjust gameplay and character development."*

Game and Art Director [Michel Koch](michel_koch.md): *"I think if we'd made this game as a [single release], we would have still wanted breaks between chapters. It would have been us saying to players, 'If you want to stop, maybe stop here, then you can go on to the next chapter.' That's sometimes the issue with bigger, longer games. We don't know when players will stop playing. I've been in this position: If I stop playing a game that's a bit slow, I might not go back to it until later [and forget what happened]."''
