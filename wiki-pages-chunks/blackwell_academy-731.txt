## Symbolism 
A well is something used to obtain water in large amounts. As water is important to human survival, it is associated with good things, hence the reason people throw coins down wells in exchange for luck.

The color black holds many negative connotations. It is the color of night and darkness (when people can not see and are therefore vulnerable), the color of bruises and body parts afflicted by frostbite, the color of ashes (which are the leavings of a fire, which can cause great harm), and the color of rotting things.

Hence we have "Black Well", or "Danger disguised as fortune". It is a fitting name considering that, despite being a school intended to give students opportunity and knowledge, Blackwell is a place where a lot of sinister and generally shady things are going on.
