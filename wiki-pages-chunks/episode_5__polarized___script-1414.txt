## **-Photography Lab-**

*Max sits up at her desk.*

**Max:** Whoa.

**Mr. Jefferson:** Alfred Hitchcock famously called film "little pieces of time”—but he could be talking about photography, as he likely was.

**Max:** *(thinking)* I'm back in class... What the hell?

**Mr. Jefferson:** These pieces of time can frame us in our glory and our sorrow.

**Max:** *(thinking)* I have to listen to this Jefferson lecture again? This might be Hell...

**Mr. Jefferson:** From light to shadow, from color to chiaroscuro... Now, can you give me an example of a photographer who perfectly captured the human condition in black and white? Anybody? Bueller?

**Max:** *(thinking)* Okay, this is messed up... Am I stuck in a time loop?

**Victoria:** Diane Arbus.

**Max:** *(thinking)* Be calm and don't freak out... yet.

**Mr. Jefferson:** There you go, Victoria. Why Arbus?

**Victoria:** Because of her images of hopeless faces. You feel, like, totally haunted by the eyes of those sad mothers and children.

**Mr. Jefferson:** She saw humanity as tortured, right?

*Blood splatters against the windows.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Wait, what's going? Nobody even cares?

**Mr. Jefferson:** And frankly, it’s bullshit. Shh, keep that to yourself. Seriously though, I could frame any one of you in a dark corner and capture you in a moment of desperation.

*The bell rings. Max is alone.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Everybody's gone now... Have I totally fucked up time? This doesn't make sense...

*She looks out the window.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Holy shit. Look at all these dead birds... This can't be real...

*Max approaches the door of the classroom.*

**Mr. Jefferson:** I see you, Max Caulfield. Don't even think about leaving here until we talk about your entry.

*Max walks over to Mr. Jefferson.*

**Mr. Jefferson:** I just wanted to know if... you'd like to spend the rest of your life in my Dark Room? Your purity inspires me so much... and we could be so happy together... Who needs selfies, when I can give you portraiture?

**Max:** *(thinking)* There's no way I'm saying that... No way.

I love you, Mr. Jefferson.I love you, Mr. Jefferson.

**Max:** I've been dreaming of the day when you would finally tell me... I love you, Mr. Jefferson.

**Mr. Jefferson:** Call me Mark. We need to play catch-up on all the time we've... wasted. Especially since there's nobody left in your life... I love you too, Max.

|-|Our dark room.# Our dark room.

**Max:** I like to think of it as... our Dark Room. It's the only place I truly feel safe and protected from the storm.

**Mr. Jefferson:** Of course, Max. I can capture you over and over... You can be my model for life... and death. We are going to be so happy together in the dark. Just make sure you stay pure... I won't like it if you get dirty like Rachel or Chloe.

|-|My selfies are shit.My selfies are shit.

**Max:** My selfies are shit... I need to be framed by a real artist. I'm just a poser...

**Mr. Jefferson:** Yes, you will be posing... for me. There's so many angles I want to expose you with to the world... I hope you don't mind needles or duct tape...

|-|Thanks for killing Chloe.# Thanks for killing Chloe.

**Max:** It's about time somebody finally killed Chloe... Think of how often that bitch almost got me killed... It's like you're doing both of us an awesome favor!

**Mr. Jefferson:** Chloe can never appreciate you the way I will... Maxine. And yes, I insist on calling you Maxine... forever.

*Mr. Jefferson disappears.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* This can't be real... I don't believe it...

*Max leaves the Photography Lab.*

## '''-Girls' Dorm Hallway-'*

*Max enters the hallway of the Girls' Dormitory. She walks up to Kate, who is crying as she lights a candle for her own vigil.''

#

## **Conversation with Kate** # 

**Max:** Hey, Kate.

(Max saved Kate)(Max saved Kate)

**Kate:** Max, why did you stop me from jumping? What kind of friend are you? You never understood me... or what happened to me... Now my family will never leave me alone... And that means I’ll always be alone... thanks to you.

**Max:** Kate, that’s not true! I’ve always been your friend...

|-|(Max couldn't save Kate)# (Max couldn't save Kate)

**Kate:** Max, how could you let me jump off a roof? You were the only person I trusted here... But you never really listened to me... Now I’m never going to Heaven... Instead you’ve stuck me in Hell... Alone forever...

**Max:** No, Kate, I was only trying to save you...

''Kate opens the door to her room, 222, and jumps into the abyss. Max follows her, only to re-enter the hallway of the Girls' Dormitory.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* This hall never ends... I better find something.

*Max must first grab the keys on the table next to the shower room, then enter Dana Ward's room, 218.*

*She will re-enter the hallway in Rachel Amber's clothes. She must enter Rachel's old room, 224.*

*Max will re-enter the hallway as Victoria. She must enter Victoria's room, 221.*

*Max will then re-enter the hallway as herself. She must enter her own room, 219.*
