There is one platinum trophy in all three games that is exclusive to PlayStation consoles.

In *Life is Strange*, there are hints on where each optional photo may be located by looking at the sketch drawings in [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md)'s optional photos section in [Max's Journal](her_journal.md) and by replaying a particular scene in an episode. All achievements that are awarded for taking optional photos refer to photography terms.
