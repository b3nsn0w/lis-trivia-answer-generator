Here is a section of the wiki page for Episode 4: Dark Room - Summary:

Chloe.

Frank will have David's gun if he had taken it earlier, otherwise, he will have his knife. It is possible for Chloe to be armed with Nathan's gun, David's gun, or unarmed. There are altered conversation options to attempt to smooth over relations if the first attempt ends less than peacefully and Max chooses to rewind. Using the stolen money from the [Raymond Wells](principal.md)'s [Principal Wells' Office](office.md) makes Frank less likely to become angry. Having attempted to shoot Frank earlier will make him more likely to get angry.

After retrieving the list, they head back to Chloe's house and start to evaluate the clues they have found. The clues lead them to an [Barn](abandoned_barn.md) owned by the [Prescott Family](prescott_family.md). They enter through a side opening and examine it closer, finding hidden stairs. After breaking the padlock to the floor covering the stairs using some rope and an old motor, they move downstairs and find a massive door with a keypad. Max manages to get the correct combination and they enter an [Dark Room (Location)](underground_bunker.md) full of photo equipment. They find binders with photos of drugged girls, including Kate and Rachel. There is also an empty binder for [Victoria Chase](victoria.md). One of the photos is of Rachel appearing to be dead in the [American Rust Junkyard](junkyard.md). Chloe is very upset by this and convinces herself that she is just posing for the camera. She recognizes the spot and rushes back to the truck, leaving Max to rush after her.

The pair drive quickly to the junkyard. After arriving, Chloe rushes to the spot and begins to dig. Max helps as well. Max quickly comes upon a decomposing body in the ground. After Chloe looks at it, she confirms that it is definitely Rachel. Extremely distraught, she wanders off a few steps and collapses onto the ground and begins to cry. Max hugs her as Chloe mourns the loss of a dear friend while the ghostly doe watches from a distance. Chloe then swears to get revenge on Nathan.

In the evening, they arrive at the [Vortex Club](vortex_club.md)'s "[End of the World Party](end_of_the_world.md)" party in search of Nathan, assuming that he plans to target Victoria. The pair bump into a very drunk Warren outside, who notes that this truly the end of the world because of the crazy weather and wants to take a picture with Max for prosperity. He uses [Max's Camera](max_s_camera.md) to take a selfie of the pair and keeps the picture. Max then notices two moons in the sky. Getting extremely impatient at the delay, Chloe splits up from Max and storms off into the party first. Max follows after.

At the party, Max can talk with various students and can use her rewind power to help [Alyssa Anderson](alyssa.md) avoid getting knocked into the [Blackwell Swimming Pool](pool.md). Max is denied access to the VIP area, but if she signed up for the Vortex Club, [Courtney Wagner](courtney.md) will help Max get in otherwise, she will have to sneak in another way. She then tries to warn Victoria of the danger she is in. If Max was nice to Victoria before and does not choose to be enemies, she will believe Max; otherwise, she will not listen to Max at all. Regardless of what Max chooses, she will tell Max that Nathan isn't at the party.

Chloe will re-enter the room after you talk to Victoria, saying she has found out that Nathan isn't anywhere else in the building. Mr. Jefferson appears and shares his disappointment with Max that she did not enter a photo into the [Everyday Heroes Photo Contest](everyday_heroes_contest.md).

He later briefly interrupts the party to announce the winner to be Victoria who comes up on stage. Victoria is invited to speak and will share her gratitude to her fellow classmates and will remark that Kate is the real Everyday Hero of Blackwell. After the announcement, the two leave the building. Just after they have left the building, Chloe gets a message from Nathan saying that there will be no evidence of Rachel Amber once he is done.

Max and Chloe hurry to the junkyard where Rachel's body is left at. Chloe rushes ahead again and is several steps ahead of Max. She arrives at Rachel's burial site first and is relieved to find it intact. While approaching the site, Max is suddenly injected with a sedative from behind. Quickly losing consciousness and unable to rewind, Max tries extremely hard to shout a warning to Chloe. Chloe realizes there is a threat and attempts to attack but is shot in the head first, killing her. Witnessing this, Max attempts to rewind but fails. Mark Jefferson's face becomes visible as Max loses consciousness.
