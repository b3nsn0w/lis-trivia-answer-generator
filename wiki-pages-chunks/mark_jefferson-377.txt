## Episode Four - "[Episode 4: Dark Room](dark_room.md)" 
As Max and Chloe enter the Blackwell campus to search Nathan's Room for proof of his involvement in the disappearance of Rachel and the drugging of Kate, they encounter Jefferson. He engages Max and Chloe in conversation and asks why someone as cool as Chloe doesn't go to Blackwell. As he leaves, Chloe remarks "Hot for teacher" as an observation on Jefferson's appearance as she watches him walk away. Chloe jokingly teases Max about her having Jefferson all to herself now that Chloe isn't at Blackwell.

After Max talks to Victoria in the VIP section of the [End of the World Party](end_of_the_world_party.md), Jefferson appears and has another chat with her and Chloe. He seems happy that she has turned up to the party, and does not act suspiciously if Max asks about Nathan. He excuses himself, getting on stage to make a speech about the winner of the "Everyday Heroes" Contest, which Victoria has won.[File:jefferson-ep4reveal.png](thumb.md) After receiving a text from Nathan, Max and Chloe rush to the [American Rust Junkyard](junkyard.md) to protect Rachel's body from being tampered with. As the girls uncover the body again, Max warns Chloe to be quiet and is approached from behind. Jefferson drugs Max by injecting her with a needle, and then shoots Chloe in the forehead. Max is unable to use her rewind power due to the drugs and is unable to save Chloe.
It is now clear that he had a hand in Rachel's disappearance and death and he is most likely working or had worked with Nathan and the Prescott family.
