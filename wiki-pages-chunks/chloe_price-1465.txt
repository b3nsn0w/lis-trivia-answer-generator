Here is a section of the wiki page for Chloe Price:

## Friends 
*[Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) - Max and Chloe have been best friends since childhood. Chloe felt abandoned when Max moved to Seattle shortly after Chloe's father died, and while they were reunited when Max began attending Blackwell, she still retains some negative feelings from their separation. Even so, Chloe cares very deeply for Max and hopes to rekindle their friendship upon her return to Arcadia Bay, since she always hoped for a reunion. She thinks of Max as the smartest and most talented person she knows, and according to her mother, always wished she could be more like her. Chloe also keeps a lot of mementos of their childhood in her room. She considers the time they spend together in Arcadia Bay now as the best time since. Eventually, she may even replace the picture of herself with Rachel Amber on her phone with one of Max, depending on whether or not Max chooses to defend her, take her side and to help her with her problems. Though she can sometimes be insensitive, Chloe and Max remain best friends, regardless of the choices Max makes. Chloe doesn't want to lose Max again and has the wish to always stay by her side. In the last episode, if Max decides to sacrifice Chloe for the sake of Arcadia Bay, they will share a long hug or a kiss and Chloe will tell her that she will always love her. If Max decides to stay with Chloe, they will leave the town, promising to always stay together and probably start a new life together. *(See [Max and Chloe](here.md) for more information on their relationship.)*
*[Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md) - Rachel and Chloe became very close friends after Max left for Seattle. Chloe thinks of Rachel as her "angel", the one who rejuvenated her life after her father died and Max left her behind. The two often got into varying degrees of mischief and spent a lot of time in Chloe's "secret hideout." Chloe developed a deep trust in Rachel, rivaled only by her friendship with Max, and planned to leave Arcadia Bay for good with her once they paid off Frank Bowers, but she disappeared before they could do so. There are numerous mementos of Chloe and Rachel's friendship in their hideout and in Chloe's room, which prove their deep bond and Rachel's central role in Chloe's life. However, Chloe was unaware of Rachel's relationship with Frank, and feels betrayed when she finds out about it.
*[Warren Graham](warren_graham.md) - Chloe can easily see the budding romance he is trying to initiate with Max. From what Max tells her, she sees him as another "Blackwell bro" and sometimes pokes fun of him. But it is implied that Chloe gets jealous of Max when she is with Warren, especially if Max agrees to go to a drive-in theater with him. If Max chooses to kiss Chloe, Chloe will joke that Warren "doesn't stand a chance" and text him about it later. When Nathan attacks Max and Chloe after they are caught investigating the boy's dorms, Warren headbutts Nathan, allowing him, Max, and Chloe to escape. Later, Chloe tells Warren that he is awesome for beating up Nathan.
*[Justin Williams](justin_williams.md) - Chloe used to hang out skating with Justin while she was friends with Rachel Amber. After her disappearance the two distanced themselves, but their friendship is still intact, as she fist bumps him when entering the Two Whales Diner in "[Episode 2: Out of Time](out_of_time.md)", and talks to him in front of the [Prescott Dormitory](prescott_dormitory.md) in "[Episode 4: Dark Room](dark_room.md)".
*[Trevor](trevor.md) - Chloe used to hang out with Trevor and his skater friends prior to Rachel Amber's disappearance.
*[Frank Bowers](frank_bowers.md) - Frank and Chloe used to hang out a lot drinking alcohol or taking drugs, but she never had any further interest in him. He was her drug dealer and she planned to leave Arcadia Bay without paying back the money she borrowed from him. Furthermore, she can't understand why her friend Rachel Amber would ever engage herself in a relationship with someone like him. Despite Chloe's angry outburst after finding out about Rachel's relationship with Frank, Chloe will eventually understand and accept their relationship where Chloe will feel remorseful if Chloe was forced to kill Frank in self-defense. Similarly, if Chloe was killed by Nathan Prescott in the sacrifice Chloe ending, Frank Bowers will attend Chloe's funeral and watch the funeral proceedings from a distance.

## Family 
*[David Madsen](david_madsen.md) - After William's death, Joyce remarried to David Madsen making him Chloe's step-dad. They have a very negative relationship that includes several disrespecting nicknames such as "step-fucker". If Max doesn't take the blame for the weed, he slaps her and calls her a loser. However, after finally realizing his good will in "[Episode 5: Polarized](polarized.md)", clearly impressed and respectful, she calls him "stepfather" and even "step-hero". She also finally acknowledges his relationship with her mother.
*[William Price](william_price.md) - Chloe was very close with her father and spent much time with him growing up. Before his death, she was bright and hopeful, traits she likely got from him, and enjoyed cooking breakfast alongside him. His sudden death left her devastated and led to her bad attitude and pessimistic outlook.
*[Joyce Price](joyce_price.md) - Chloe's relationship with her mother is strained due to her irresponsible behavior and Joyce's marriage to David. Sometimes, Chloe even feels betrayed by Joyce for marrying someone like him. Chloe also sometimes blames Joyce for the death of her father, due to her being the reason behind William using the car the day of his accident. Joyce still holds hope that Chloe will turn her life around, whether it be with the help of Max or Rachel, but Chloe very rarely returns her affection. In "Polarized" however, Chloe finally acknowledges what her mother had to give up and live through over all the years, and even appreciates the role David plays in her life now.
*[Dorothy](aunt_dorothy.md) - It's revealed in the alternative timeline that Joyce has an aunt. Not much is known about her other than her inability to help the Prices financially due to having her own medical bills.
*[Aaron Price](aaron_price.md) - William's brother sent a letter to him regarding not being able to send as much money as he'd like.
*[Bongo](bongo.md) - Chloe's pet cat who was killed by a car in 2008. Max and Chloe made a gravestone for him in Chloe's backyard.
