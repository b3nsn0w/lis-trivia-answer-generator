Here is a section of the wiki page for Max's Nightmare:

## Trivia 
* In the reversed Blackwell Academy sequence of Max's nightmare, you can hear and see things normally if Max uses her rewind power in this scene.
*If Max takes too long to find the key, in the girls dormitories, she will actually ask for Chloe's help; "Chloe, please help me." Another sign of the deepening bond between the girls.
*In the same sequence, there are dead whales outside the dormitories in every hallway Max enters, except in the last part, when Max reemerges as herself.
*The characters that weren't originally talking in Episode 1 say things they already said during the game. These characters are: [Evan Harris](evan.md), [Alyssa Anderson](alyssa.md), [Stella Hill](stella.md), Trevor and Principal Wells.
*A glimpse of the red folders at the end of "[Episode 1: Chrysalis](chrysalis.md)" reveals that the folder immediately before the one marked "Rachel" is marked with the name "Kelly". When Rachel Amber was attending Blackwell Academy, a girl called Kelly Davis was staying in room 217 which is the room directly opposite Rachel Amber's old room (224) and next door to [Dana Ward](dana_ward.md)'s room (218). These room residents are visible on the [Media:Dormmap2.png](dormitory_floor_plan.md) that appears in a section of the nightmare. It has been confirmed by [DONTNOD](dontnod.md) that these two are the same Kelly.
*Tara Garcia, Kelly Davis, Lyla Lee, Hadley Wright are all supposed to be previous students of Blackwell who were there before Max even arrived. But since she never saw their names anywhere during the game, their real existence is debatable, they could all be figments of Max's imagination (except for Kelly, as mentioned above). Or it would mean the nightmare sequence was more than just a dream.
*The solely reflected "0311" in the diner's restroom mirror places strong emphasis on Max's closeness to Chloe, as March 11th is Chloe's birthday. This compliments the time Chloe remembered Max's birthday in the first episode. It is perhaps no small coincidence that this is the number that frees Max from this room.
**"0311" could also be a reference to the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake that occurred on 11 March 2011, which fits the dark and catastrophic atmosphere of the nightmare.
**If you enter the incorrect code **50 times**, the door will open and Max will say, "I'm going to make the designers pay for all these bullshit code puzzles!" (A fun example of Max [Easter_Eggs_(Life is Strange)#Breaking_the_Fourth_Wall](breaking_the_fourth_wall.md).)
*According to unused voiced lines, William Price was in the maze sequence too, but he was removed for unknown reasons.
*Rachel was supposed to have several lines of dialogue during the nightmare sequence. No voice actor ever recorded those though.[File:Headphones.png](16px.md)[File:Headphones.png](16px.md)
*Max's doppelganger is referred to as "Max Ghost" in the game files.
*Max's doppelganger adopts a disdainful posture which is reminiscent of the cross-legged posture Victoria adopted during the art class. It is possible "Max Ghost" is the embodiment of Max's subconscious, so judgmental that Max made an involuntary comparison with Victoria.
*There is a strong possibility the nightmare sequence lasted exactly the same time as Chloe needed to bring Max from the beach to the lighthouse. This trip takes 15 minutes on normal conditions. Taking into account the terrible weather and Max's deadweight, Chloe could have taken as much as 30 minutes, if not 60 to reach the lighthouse. This is roughly the time needed to complete the nightmare sequence. Usually, dreams don't end in a proper way. On the contrary, Max's nightmare makes a perfect transition with reality: Chloe and Max arriving at the lighthouse. It can be explained if Max was dreaming the whole time in a half-awoken state, unconsciously registering her environment to shape the nightmare. In this case time would likely flow at the same speed in the nightmare as it would in reality. 
*According to [Jean-Luc Cano](jean_luc_cano.md), co-writer of Life is Strange, the nightmare sequence was originally supposed to take place at the beginning of the third episode instead of the fifth episode. [https://www.hautbasgauchedroite.fr/fr/podcast/228/P226-le-role-du-scenario-et-du-scenariste-dans-le-developpement-d-un-jeu #226 - Le rôle du scénariste dans le développement d'un jeu (Life is Strange) et l'évolution du scénario dans le temps]
*The Everyday Zeroes poster inspired a real-life supportive community [Everyday Zeroes](of_the_same_name.md) on Twitter.

: ''For Chloe's dreams in [Life is Strange: Before the Storm](before_the_storm.md), see here: [Chloe's Dreams](chloe_s_dreams.md)*

> There is nothing like the sense of relief after waking up from a vivid nightmare. Despite all the terrible things that have been happening this past week, I felt so free and hopeful when I finally woke up. And my nightmare was so obvious... all my fears about being an artist, about my rewind power, and, of course, about my partner in crime and time, Chloe Price..

**Max Caulfield in "[Episode 5: Polarized**, Polarized](episode_5__polarized____polarized.md)"

In "[Episode 5: Polarized](polarized.md)", the fifth episode of *[Life is Strange](life_is_strange.md)'', [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) has a** **strange** nightmare**. This occurs after reuniting with [Chloe Price](chloe_price.md) at the [beach](beach.md), shortly after rewinding and convincing her not to enter the [End of the World Party](end_of_the_world_party.md). This nightmare is a reflection of all events of the week and Max's decisions, and depicts Max's feelings, especially her doubts, fears, insecurities, and feelings of guilt. Max is constantly confronted with the consequences of her choices and is accused of doing the wrong things by all appearing characters. Every important location of the week is revisited, and all characters Max met are featured in some way, especially the most important ones. It also sets a focus on [Max and Chloe](max_and_chloe.md)'s relationship, and their key moments in every episode.
