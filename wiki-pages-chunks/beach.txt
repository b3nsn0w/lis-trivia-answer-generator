The **Beach** is a location first seen in [Episode 2: Out of Time](episode_2.md). Previous to that, we can catch a glimpse of it by looking towards the sea at the [lighthouse](lighthouse.md).

##  Episode Two - "[Episode 2: Out of Time](out_of_time.md)" 
The beach is first seen in the ending cutscene of this episode, as [Frank Bowers](frank_bowers.md) and [Pompidou](pompidou.md) sit there admiring the eclipse.

##  Episode Four - "[Episode 4: Dark Room](dark_room.md)" 
The [Alternative Beach](alternative_beach.md) is featured in the [Alternative Timeline (Life is Strange)](alternative_timeline.md) in the beginning of this episode.

Trying to find out more about [Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md)'s disappearance, [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) and [Chloe Price](chloe_price.md) drive to the beach to confront [Frank Bowers](frank.md) and get a list of his clients. This results in a complex showdown that ends with Frank getting possibly shot or stabbed, though it is possible to befriend him.

##  Episode Five - "[Episode 5: Polarized](polarized.md)" 
After convincing Chloe to not enter the [End of the World Party](end_of_the_world_party.md), Max wakes up at the beach with Chloe by her side, and finds out that the [storm](storm.md) is approaching [Arcadia Bay](arcadia_bay.md). They share a hug and Chloe tells Max everything that happened while she was out. Shortly after they decide to proceed to the lighthouse, Max loses consciousness and falls into a disturbing [Max's Nightmare](nightmare.md).
