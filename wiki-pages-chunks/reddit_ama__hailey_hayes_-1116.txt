## Question 19 

**GO-ON-A-STEAM-TRAIN**

Hi! :) Thank you for stopping by and answering questions! :)

I was just wondering what recording with the other cast felt like? It must have been surreal getting to be a part of a series you'd played before getting casted! :)

The other thing I was curious about is if you're still in touch with anyone from the voice or game side of things? Would you like to work with anyone in particular again? :)

Thank you again for doing this, Samantha was one of my favourite characters in Before the Storm! :)

Hello! Thank you for stopping by and asking some great questions!

So I actually recorded alone. However, getting to meet up and talk with other members of the original cast such as Daye and Hannah definitely felt surreal and mind blowing because here are two people who brought to life two amazing on screen presences I thought I'd never talk to in my life and now they're inviting me to stream with them and eat waffles together. It's really cool and I wish there was a more eloquent word I could use to sum it up, but I feel like "cool" says it all.
I am definitely still in touch with most of the VAs from both games and Phil, our voice director. Honestly, I'd love to work with any of the VAs on another project again and Phil is my favorite director I've worked with so I definitely would love to work on another project with him.
Ah thank you so much! I'm so glad you enjoyed her and the game!

Thank you so much for your answer! I didn't realise it was a solo mission to perform dialogue! :) I can totally see why the developers would much prefer that, but from how the talking went back and forth I can't believe you weren't in the same room! :) That just made your scene outside Blackwell even more impressive! :)

That's so nice!! :) I'm really happy that you had a blast recording it, and it wasn't a one and done deal. :) I need to have a look into twitch a bit more, it sounds like a bunch of awesome people who worked on the series are on there! :D

Fingers crossed that next project with Phil is in this world, but I really can't wait to see what's next, best of luck, and thank you so much for answering, you've made my day! üòÅ

## Question 20 
**PinkAbuuna** 

Hello!

# How are you today?
# If DONTNOD announced a Life is Strange Video Game Universe akin to the MCU, how would you react?
# Best moment when voicing Samantha?
# If you could tell yourself before getting the role of Sam anything, what would you say and why?
# Will you be playing The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit, what game are you currently playing, and what are you hoping to play?
# How many questions in an AMA from one person are too many?

**haileyhayes**

Hello!
#You're super sweet! I'm doing great, thanks, how are you? :)
#Omg I'd be so excited. That would be the coolest thing ever. I can't wait for Life is Strange: Infinity War
# Best moment when voicing Samantha was the "You shut the fuck up" line and also "You should be ashamed" because Phil had me flip him off in the booth while I delivered that line which was pretty cool
# Oh god, if I could tell myself anything before getting Samantha it would be 'Keep pushing forward, all your hard work's about to pay off.'
# I will definitely be playing The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit! I'm super excited for it! Currently, I'm playing South Park: The Fractured But Whole, Heavy Rain, and Inside. I have so many games I'm hoping to play, I think I'm most excited for the Batman: Arkham series, Detroit: Become Human, and the Tomb Raider series
# Oh there can never be enough. One million. That might be excessive, but even then I'd probably answer all one million of them tbh

**PinkAbuuna** 

With #2, would Hawt Dog Man be the "Thanos" of the universe? ü§î 

**haileyhayes**

UM PLEASE. I NEED THIS FAN ART NOW

## Question 21 

**AkashicRecorder**

Hi Hailey!

Since Life is Strange 2 has been said to feature completely new characters, what kind of settings and characters would you personally like to see in it?

**haileyhayes**

Hello!

Awesome question! Well I honestly have no idea what the new season of Life is Strange holds, but I think it would be very cool to follow the adult protagonist of Captain Spirit, even though we still don't know much about him yet!
