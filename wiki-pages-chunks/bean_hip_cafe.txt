The **Bean Hip Cafe** is a location in an unknown area. Little is known about the cafe itself, other than its connection to [Mark Jefferson](mark_jefferson.md)'s artwork.

##  Jefferson Exhibition 
There was an exhibition for Mark Jefferson's work there from November 5 - December 1, 2009. It emphasizes his fame by stating that he is an "international photographer".

On October 7th, 2013 during [Episode 1: Chrysalis](episode_1.md), [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) can find a leaflet for the exhibition in [Victoria Chase](victoria_chase.md)'s [Victoria's Room](bedroom.md) in the [Prescott Dormitory](prescott_dormitory.md). An advert in the leaflet gives the owner a dollar off entry to the exhibition.

Victoria clearly has a passionate admiration for Jefferson's work due to her hanging on to the leaflet for sentimental purposes.

##  Location 
It is presumed to be around [Arcadia Bay](arcadia_bay.md); however, the leaflet only states that it's a "local exhibition." This could mean it is local to Victoria's home city of [Seattle](seattle.md).

A [media:Note3-pool-lostgoggles.png](lost_property_ad.md) can be found inside [Blackwell Academy](blackwell_academy.md)'s [Blackwell Swimming Pool](swimming_pool.md) building in "[Episode 3: Chaos Theory](chaos_theory.md)" which could suggest the cafe isn't too far away from Blackwell due to a monetary reward to use in the cafe being offered by a student.

##  Trivia 
*The above-mentioned ad for lost swimming goggles was written by student Ray Siren and offers eternal gratitude plus a $25 gift card to use at the Bean Hip Cafe as a reward for returning them.
