Here is a section of the wiki page for Max and Chloe:

## Life is Strange 2Â 
[File:LiS2E5_Away_-_Max_&_Chloe.png](thumb.md) If Arcadia Bay had perished in the storm, Max and Chloe's friendship has continued into July, 2017. This is first established in the [Episode 5: Wolves](final_episode.md) from a [Media:LiS2 Chloe & Max.png](photograph.md) kept by Chloe's step-father, [David Madsen (Life is Strange 2)](david_madsen.md), who is now part of a remote desert commune in Arizona called "[Away](away.md)."
There are some differences in their appearance in this photograph:
* Chloe's tattoo has been given a partial black ink cover-up.Co-Game Director Michel Koch stated that the reasoning behind it was due to a combination of "mixed feelings: angst, remorse, guilt, to not forget who died in the storm, to grow up, to advance in her life," and "to never forget." - Source: [https://twitter.com/DONTNOD_Michel/status/1202347738383425537 Twitter post by Michel Koch] She also appears to be growing her hair out into its natural color. The green that extends down from this could be what remains of the blue-turquoise hair she was seen with in the original game, as blue-turquoise dye fades to green due to its undertones being green (unless it is primed with a purple toner which neutralizes yellows).
**There is no date to the photograph, but if Chloe was no longer dying her hair after the events of Season 1, then 6 inches of average human hair growth would put this photograph at approximately one year after the events of Season 1. If she continued to dye her hair in a blue-turquoise or even deliberately green, then she could have decided to stop doing this at any time, making it more difficult to date the photograph.
* With regards to Max, there are no big differences in her appearance other than her bangs looking either grown out or swept aside more.

Polaroids are also seen inside David's trailer, which perhaps implies these were taken by Max and that her interest in retro photography has also continued.

David confides in the [Sean Diaz](main_protagonist.md) of *Life is Strange 2* that he used to hate Max and Chloe for running away - hitting the road and never looking back while he was trying to rebuild. Once he acknowledged that the past was the past and moved on, like they did, he reached out to them, and they made peace with each other. They both stayed at "Away" for a while. During the conversation, he pauses as he refers to Chloe as his "daughter," almost as though he is still getting used to using that word.

The above conversation is interrupted by David's cell phone ringing, and he takes the call in the privacy of his trailer. He opens the call with, "Hey, Sweetie! What's up?" As the conversation unfolds, it becomes clear that this is a call from Chloe. The call implies that Max and Chloe are either in New York or had just had a bad experience with somebody from New York. The experience seems to concern Max and a gallery, and Max may have been trying to submit her work to a gallery or was perhaps applying for a job at one. David is heard to ask Chloe, "How about that other gallery she told me about?" then follows it up with, "Cool! Fingers crossed then!" After his comment about them checking out his working solar panels the next time they come by, he suggests they could maybe drive down to Louisiana or Texas, which could mean they have plans to visit soon. He ends the call with, "Wish Max luck for me, okay? Bye bye, love ya!"

It is clear from *Life is Strange 2* that, if Arcadia Bay was sacrificed, Chloe and Max continue to be there for one another (which may have also evolved into a romantic relationship) and that Chloe has now accepted David as a father figure in her life.

## Life is Strange: True Colors 
Max and Chloe are only mentioned in the game's [Wavelengths](dlc_chapter.md).  In the Halloween segment (if Arcadia Bay was sacrificed), while Steph and [Mikey North (Wavelengths)](mikey.md) are playing tabletop, Mikey asks Steph if she ever talked to Chloe. Steph says that she's "off the radar" like her and she is wandering with her other "weirdo" (a reference to Max).
