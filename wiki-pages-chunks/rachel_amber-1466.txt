Here is a section of the wiki page for Rachel Amber:

## Romantic 
*[Frank Bowers](frank_bowers.md) - It is clear that Rachel had a relationship with Frank, and that she valued him highly, even considering to leave Arcadia Bay with himThis is evident from a [Media:Rachel-lettertofrank.png](letter.md) from Rachel to Frank in his RV.. However, she was unable to find the courage to tell Chloe directly about the relationship and appears to have left Frank after he became violent while on drugs as evidenced in another letter in Frank's RV. Whether this relationship break would have been permanent is unknown. It is Nathan's belief that Rachel was only using Frank to have easy access to drugs and was letting Frank take pictures of her to fool him into thinking their relationship went deeper. Nathan claims Rachel thought Frank was a liar and loser like most people did in Arcadia Bay. *(See [Rachel and Frank](here.md) for more information on their relationship.)*
* [Chloe Price](chloe_price.md) - It is implied that Chloe may have had romantic feelings for Rachel, as she more or less admits to having a crush on her when speaking with Max in "[Episode 3: Chaos Theory](chaos_theory.md)"Max: "Sounds like you totally crushed on Rachel." . . . Chloe: "You would have too. Smart, sexy and sassy... Like me, right?" (Episode 3: Chaos Theory - Chloe's bedroom.) and is devastated to find her body in "[Episode 4: Dark Room](dark_room.md)", breaking down in tears in front of Max and saying she loved her so much. Chloe's sexuality and whether Rachel reciprocated feelings are unstated. It is possible they had feelings they never acted on, but this is also unstated. Also possible is that Rachel knew about Chloe's feelings towards her, considering how troubled she was to tell Chloe about her relationship with Jefferson. Fearing Chloe might hate her for it, Rachel also kept her relationship with Frank a secret from Chloe. What is clear, though, is that Chloe thought a lot of Rachel and was quick to anger over her discovery of Rachel's secret relationship with Frank. It is implied through dialogue that Chloe would have preferred to remain blind to the discovery of Rachel's attention being divided: *"She blended like a chameleon. Clearly more than I knew... or wanted to know...".* 
* [Mark Jefferson](mark_jefferson.md) - It is rumored that they had slept with each other. Both had their affections for photography and modeling which could have led to them hooking up. Jefferson was most probably the person whom Rachel met shortly before her disappearance who "changed her life" (as she had told Chloe). During the *Life is Strange* [Square_Enix_Extra_Life_Livestream_(November_2015)](livestream.md), the developers confirmed that Rachel was in fact in love with Jefferson and that [Media:RachelChloeLetter.png](the_letter.md) to Chloe in their hideout actually referred to him. She also seemed to trust Jefferson a lot as Jefferson knew about Rachel's relation to Chloe and Frank, yet Chloe and Frank were completely clueless about Rachel's love for Mark Jefferson. Jefferson describes Rachel as having loved her pictures being taken by him and that they had a real connection. He seemed to have an affection for Rachel but not actually love her and didn't seem too upset when she died as he felt her death would have been inevitable, considering her plans to go to Los Angeles. Although rumors were abundant about Rachel's relationship with Mark Jefferson, the reality of it can never truly be established as Jefferson is an unreliable narrator. *(See [Rachel and Jefferson](here.md) for more information on their relationship.)*

## Symbolism

## Spirit Animal 
There has been some debate over the true spirit animal of Rachel.

The blue jay feather Rachel wears as an earring is representative of the other characters wearing their spirit animals. Max wears the doe shirt, Chloe the blue butterfly tattoo. The blue jay fits Rachel's personality, it's very adaptable, able to fit into other groups, just like Rachel fits into any group at school. They are highly intelligent and known for risk-taking as well. The blue jay in Chloe's house constantly dying in one theory is representative of Chloe's deaths and in another is representative of Rachel in that no matter how you try to save it, it's always going to die, foreshadowing that Rachel is dead.

Some believe it is the [Doe](doe.md), due to its frequent appearances in the Junkyard; specifically in Episode 2 when it originates from the same spot in which Rachel is buried, and in Episode 4 when the Doe observes Max and Chloe at the grave, and disappears, as if to signify her spirit is at rest since being found. In the [Director's Commentary](director_s_commentary.md), it has been confirmed that "the doe is clearly linked to Rachel and it's basically somehow a presence of Rachel that's guiding Max at moments." This works with the doe as Max's spirit animal, as any spirit guiding Max would appear as a doe to her, regardless of their spirit animal.

Rachel is also associated with the [Blue Butterfly](blue_butterfly.md). Native American cultures see the butterfly as a symbol of the spreading of joy and of transformation.http://www.whats-your-sign.com/butterfly-animal-symbolism.html Rachel was extremely popular at Blackwell; Chloe admits that anyone would have had a crush on her. Her ability to spread joy and empower people around Arcadia Bay was well known. The Butterfly is a potent symbol for those considering, or in the throes of, a big change; Rachel represents a change in Arcadia Bay, in addition to her personal change of moving to Los Angeles, or perhaps the change in the form of her death. This change could also be the change in the pattern of victims in the Dark Room Conspiracy; she is the only known victim to be killed by the culprits.

In some traditions, butterflies are also seen as messengers or guides from the land of the dead; this would be extremely applicable if Rachel's spirit intervened in the initial bathroom scene, by giving Max the ability to use her rewind powers."Departed loved ones can also speak to us through butterflies. Many people report seeing butterflies shortly after a loved one’s death. Some see the butterfly as a symbol of resurrection, while others consider it to be the essence of the deceased’s soul. In fact, there is an old Irish saying, “Butterflies are souls of the dead waiting to pass through purgatory."
