Here is a section of the wiki page for Episode 1: Chrysalis - Script:

## '''Chloe's Car** 
**Max:** Man, Nathan Prescott is messed up. And dangerous... This day never ends...

**Chloe:''' "Oh, and thanks, Chloe!" After five years you're still Max Caulfield.

*Max looks down and shifts uncomfortably in her seat.*

**Chloe:** Don't give me the guilty face. At least pretend you're glad to see me.

**Max:** I am seriously glad to see you. Oh, and thanks, Chloe. It makes perfect sense I'd see you today.

**Chloe:** Yes, it's been that kind of day. So what did that freak want with you?

Hopefully nothing.Hopefully nothing.

**Max:** Hopefully nothing after today. So, how do you know Nathan?

**Chloe:** He's just another Arcadia asshole... Your friend really took a beatdown for you.

|-|I have no idea.# I have no idea.

**Max:** I have no idea. I know he's a Prescott.

**Chloe:** And an asshole. Your friend really stood up for you...

**Max:** Warren? Yeah, I owe him big time.

**Chloe:** You're not the only one in debt, and you're already causing trouble.

**Max:** I thought it would be quiet here. Feels so weird to be back.

**Chloe:** So I guess Seattle sucked hard?

I guess.I guess.

**Max:** I guess. It was cool, but...I felt kinda lonely, out of my league.

**Chloe:** I would think you'd fit right in with the art school hipsters...

**Max:** Right. You look like the cover of Hipster Girl dot com.

**Chloe:** At least you're still a smartass.

**Max:** That's why I'm here.

|-|No.# No.

**Max:** No, it felt like a real city for artists, big and bright. Great for taking pictures.

**Chloe:** Yeah, must be hard coming back to a hick town like Arcadia again...

**Max:** Not after seeing you.

**Chloe:** Please, girl. You came back for Blackwell Academy.

Of course.Of course.

**Max:** Of course. It's one of the best photography programs in the country...and my favorite teacher, Mark Jefferson.

**Chloe:** So you came back to Arcadia for a teacher...not your best friend.

|-|Only for Mark Jefferson.# Only for Mark Jefferson.

**Max:** Only for Mark Jefferson. He was a pretty famous photographer in the '90s... I've always loved his work.

**Chloe:** Those that can't do, teach. I'm glad you found a good reason to come back.

**Max:** Don't you think I'm happy to see you?

**Chloe:** No. You were happy to wait five years without a call, or even a text.

I wanted to.I wanted to.

**Max:** I wanted to. I was just so tripped out over leaving Arcadia...

**Chloe:** Oh, please. I'm sure your phone and laptop were frozen in time.

**Max:** You're merciless.

|-|Give me a break.# Give me a break.

**Max:** Give me a break. I was going through changes...like you.

**Chloe:** I guess those changes included dumping me from your life.

**Max:** That's not true, Chloe.

**Chloe:** Bullshit. You thought you'd hook up with all these art pricks in Seattle. Didn't happen, though.

**Max:** You're merciless.

|-|I'm sorry...I'm sorry...

**Max:** I'm sorry. I know things were tough on you when I left.

**Chloe:** How do you know? You weren't even here.

**Max:** I didn't order my parents to move specifically to fuck you over, Chloe.

**Chloe:** You've been at Blackwell for almost a month without letting me know. 'Nuff said.

**Max:** I just wanted to settle in first and not be such a shy cliché geek. I totally would have contacted you...

**Chloe:** I bet you don't use these sad excuses on Mr. Jefferson... Don't use them on me, Max.

*Max falls back on the seat behind her. She watches Chloe for a while, then bends down to retrieve her camera, which was smashed during the confrontation in the parking lot.*

**Max:** Broken. Oh man, are you cereal?

**Chloe:** Wow, haven't heard that one in a while...

**Max:** Not everything changes. Except my camera has officially taken a shit.

**Chloe:** My step-douche has a boatload of tools. Maybe you can fix it at my place...

**Max:** I need very specific, tiny tools.

**Chloe:** Nerd alert! My stepdad has a fully-stocked garage. And he actually is a tiny tool. Welcome home, Max.

''Max and Chloe drive up to Chloe's house and park in the driveway. They get out of the car and Chloe begins unlocking the door with her keys.''

**Chloe:** Come on in, don't be shy.

**Max:** The house still looks...nice.

**Chloe:** Home, shit home.

*Chloe enters the house and Max follows her.*

**- [Chloe's Room](chloe_s_room.md) -'*

*Max and Chloe enter Chloe's room.*

**Chloe:** My room looks a bit different than the last time you saw it.

*Chloe sits on her bed.''

**Max:** It's cool. At least we can chill out.

**Chloe:** This isn't exactly my "chill-out zone"... My step-führer makes sure of that. Come in and close the door. Put on some music while I medicate.

*Chloe begins smoking.*
