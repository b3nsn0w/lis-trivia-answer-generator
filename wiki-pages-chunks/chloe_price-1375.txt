Here is a section of the wiki page for Chloe Price:

## Romantic 
*[Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) - From the beginning, there are several implications that Chloe has romantic feelings for Max. She is very fond of her company and claims that Max gives her a reason for staying in Arcadia Bay, since over the years without Max she just tried to get out of there. Chloe obviously admires Max a lot thinking of her as the smartest and most talented person she knows. Based on Max's behavior and decisions, Chloe will change her mobile phone background from Rachel to Max. She often makes insinuating and teasing comments on Max, such as "Maybe you made a move on me and I would never know"Two Whales Diner scene in Episode 2: Out of Time, "Sure Blackwell bros are all over you, like Warren"Episode 3: Chaos Theory or "I just don't think anybody is good enough for you... besides me."[Episode 3: Chaos Theory](episode_3__chaos_theory.md), and becomes somewhat distressed when she learns that Max is going to a movie with Warren. She will also joke about marrying Max if Max attempted to shoot Frank in Episode 2. Chloe appears very intrigued if Max decides to enter the Blackwell Swimming Pool through the girls' dressing locker instead of the boys'. Also, the way she ogles at Max when she takes off her clothes at the swimming pool[Media:Chloe's stare.jpg](screenshot.md) from "Chaos Theory" indicates further interest. She comments on her as cute on several occasions, for example after their Blackwell night trip, and even dares Max to kiss her, which will impact their relationship as time goes on. If Max decides to kiss her, Chloe will react very surprised and embarrassed, and joke that she will text Warren, who she perceives as a possible rival, that he doesn't stand a chance. She will also tell Max better not to rewind and take that kiss back. Otherwise, she will react somewhat disappointed and claim that Max already macked on her and then used her rewind. Driven by jealousy, she will mention that she would text Warren that Max saved herself all for him. Chloe will later refer to that kiss when Max hugs her after returning from the alternative timeline as, "You got one kiss and now you're all over me?" In the last episode, Max writes in her journal that she didn't know if the jealousy she felt when seeing Chloe in her nightmare be with other people was the feeling of friendship or love, and that she's about to find out. Max refers to Chloe as her number one priority and all that matters to her, while constantly desperately trying to keep her by her side. She may even decide to give up her dream of becoming a recognized artist as made possible in the San Francisco timeline, or to sacrifice a whole town to be with Chloe for the rest of her life. If Max chooses to sacrifice Chloe, kissed her in Episode 3 and supported her enough until then, they will share one final kiss before Max travels back in time to correct the timeline. Chloe will tell her that she will always love her to which Max will respond that she will never forget her. If Max chooses to save her instead, Chloe will say that she will always be with her. They will eventually leave Arcadia Bay's ruins behind after the storm subsided, and probably start a new life together. *(See [Max and Chloe](here.md) for more information on their relationship.)*
*[Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md) - Chloe had a crush on Rachel during their time together, which is evident in how fondly she talks about her to Max, describing her as her "angel" and "savior", but also as "smart and sexy". The fact that she keeps mementos of them in a metal box under her bed, that she carries a photo of Rachel around in her wallet, or that she has a picture of her as her mobile background, emphasizes how highly Chloe treasures Rachel. She later admits to Max that she had a crush on Rachel in "Chaos Theory". Clearly, this is reinforced by how hurt Chloe is when she finds out about Rachel's (romantic/sexual) relationship with Frank. She is also driven to tears when she discovers Rachel's body in the junkyard, admitting to Max that she loved her. It's unknown whether Rachel knew about those feelings, or reciprocated them. But considering how troubled Rachel was to tell Chloe about her relationships with Frank and Jefferson, it's likely that she knew about Chloe's feelings towards her and didn't want to hurt her.

## Symbolism

## Colour Symbolism 
Chloe is associated with several colors. Her clothing is notably black and white, which is associated with death, which makes sense due to Chloe's several run-ins with death during the game, and her death triggering Max's rewind power in the first place. She is hit directly in the stomach in the middle of the skull motif on her shirt in the beginning of the game. The skull imagery also associated with Chloe is interesting, and also reminiscent of death. Most of her shirts contain skulls, as does her vibrant tattoo.

Chloe is also associated with the color red. Her tattoo is filled with red ribbon-like designs. Red is associated with anger, aggression and tragic circumstances. All of this makes sense with Chloe due to her angry attitude towards her family situation and abandonment issues, as well as her own deaths and previous drug addiction. Red can also be associated with riches and wealth; the red ribbon could be a symbol of her desire for money, and her debt to Frank.

The last color Chloe is most highly associated with is the blue color of her hair which is also reflected in her eyes and nail polish. It is associated with those who are vulnerable or aspiring for the future. This could add to both Chloe's emotional vulnerability with abandonment (as opposed to her near-death experiences) and her hopes of reuniting with Rachel. It also applies to the blue butterfly which appears during Chloe's first near-death experience during the game and later at her funeral in the Sacrifice Chloe ending.

Chloe's outfit is splashed with blue in the alternative timeline; this matches her breathing apparatus. The color makes sense, as her respiratory system is vulnerable and failing, and she becomes hopeful that she can have her last good memory with Max before she dies. The color red is also prominent here however, as a symbol of the tragic circumstances of her accident.
