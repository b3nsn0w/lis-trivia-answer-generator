of herself all over the web... and even I'm in this one. At least the news didn't mention my name...
yet."
**Kate dead: **"Glad the media doesn't waste a second exploiting tragedy. Now Kate's family has to 
see their daughter's death all over the web like a cat video... and I'm even in this one. That
makes me ill."}}

much less Kate..."}}
