## '''Nathan and Chloe's conversation** 
**Nathan:'* *(breathing heavily)'' It's cool, Nathan... Don't stress... You're okay, bro. Just count to three... Don't be scared... You own this school... If I wanted, I could blow it up... You're the boss...

*[Chloe Price](chloe.md) enters.*

**Nathan:** So what do you want?

**Chloe:** I hope you checked the perimeter, as my step-ass would say. Now, let's talk bidness—

**Nathan:** I got nothing for you.

**Chloe:** Wrong. You got hella cash.

**Nathan: **That's my family, not me.

**Chloe:** Oh, boohoo, poor little rich kid. I know you been pumpin' drugs 'n' shit to kids around here... I bet your respectable family would help me out if I went to them. Man, I can see the headlines now—

**Nathan:** Leave them out of this, bitch.

**Chloe:** I can tell everybody Nathan Prescott is a punk ass who begs like a little girl and talks to himself—

*Nathan takes out his gun and points it at Chloe. She backs up into the wall and Nathan stands in front of her, one arm against the wall and the other pointing the gun at her stomach.*

**Nathan:** You don't know who the fuck I am or who you're messing around with!

**Chloe:** Where'd you get that? What are you doing? Come on, put that thing down!

**Nathan:** Don't EVER tell me what to do. I'm so SICK of people trying to control me!

**Chloe:** You are going to get in hella more trouble for this than drugs—

**Nathan: **Nobody would ever even miss your "punk ass" would they?

**Chloe:** Get that gun away from me, psycho!

*Chloe pushes Nathan away from her and he pulls the trigger, shooting Chloe in the stomach. Max comes out from behind the stall.*

**Max:** NO!

*Max stretches out her right hand. The gun and Chloe fall on the ground in slow motion and everything becomes blurry. Moments later, the whole sequence is reversed and Max finds herself in the art class again.*
