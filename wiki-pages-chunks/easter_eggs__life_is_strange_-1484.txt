Here is a section of the wiki page for Easter Eggs (Life is Strange):

## Cat Pics 
Throughout the game, on several occasions it's mentioned that someone lost his tablet with cat pics on it. It became a running gag since there are several funny hints to the owner's desperate attempts to get it back, and even the thief has their say.
* At the beginning of the first episode, Max spots a paper calling for help in finding the missing tablet and advertising a finder's reward. It states that the tablet contains a lot of personal pics of the owner's late cats (RIP). It also says that everyone would know who and where the owner is.
* At the entrance to the [End of the World Party](end_of_the_world_party.md), you can hear [Stella](stella.md) talking to someone explaining that she hasn't seen any tablet with cat pics.
* In Episode 5, in the street leading to the diner, Max can find a note from the actual thief saying that he regrets what he did and that he only was jealous that the owner "had all those cool cats in his life".
* In [Max's Nightmare](max_s_nightmare.md) in Episode 5, one of the lines written in [Max's Nightmare Journal](her_journal.md) says,*"Find my cat pix. Please. My heart is broken."*

## Deja Vu 
In Episode 5, there are several instances where Jefferson shoots David if Max tries to warn David instead of pulling the cable of the reflector umbrella left to her to distract Jefferson. Given the following warning options: ''David's Gun, Bottle, Table, Jefferson's Gun,* David will get shot at least one time before the player notices the *Pull* option. When Max warns David about the gun Jefferson is hiding in his cabinet, which is the fourth out of four warning options available in this scene, Jefferson is again faster than David and manages to shoot him. Afterwards, he appears a bit puzzled and says,

*"Sorry, Madsen. Okay... Déjà vu..."''

## Final Fantasy: Spirits Within 
In Episode 1, "[Episode 1: Chrysalis](chrysalis.md)", when Max is in Victoria's dorm room, she looks at her plasma TV and says,

*"That is a tasty plasma. Maybe I could sneak in and watch "Final Fantasy: Spirits Within."*

The film Final Fantasy: Spirits Within was rendered by Square Pictures, which is now a consolidated subsidiary of Square Enix, the publisher of *Life is Strange*.

## Don't Nod 
In Episode 1: Chrysalis, just as the logo of Dontnod Entertainment comes up for the credits, Max nods twice to the music playing in her earbuds.

## Hawt Dawg Man 
{{Main|Hawt Dawg Man}}
Hawt Dawg Man appears several times throughout the game:

* He is seen in alternative timeline [Chloe Price](chloe.md)'s bedroom.
* He is featured on a poster on the wall of [Kate Marsh](kate.md)'s hospital room (if she is still alive in "[Episode 4: Dark Room](dark_room.md)").
* He appears on an [Plane](airplane.md) screen in an alternative timeline in "[Episode 5: Polarized](polarized.md)".
* He is featured on a photo in the Zeitgeist Gallery.
* There is a calendar featuring Hawt Dawg Man in the storeroom Max enters on the way to the [Two Whales Diner](two_whales_diner.md).

## Hella Large 
With the [Limited Edition (Life is Strange)#Limited Edition Patch](limited_edition_patch.md) subtitle language, size and opacity became adjustable. The last subtitle size option after large is "Hella Large", referring to [Chloe Price](chloe.md)'s slang.

## Hidden Concept Art 
Several DVD covers and polaroids appear to feature concept art that was created for the game itself.[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/7h73rm/s1_e5_dvd_cover_easter_egg/ Reddit post by /u/IgelRM] (TBC)

## Kate's Video 
Although there is an opportunity to view snippets of [Kate Marsh](kate.md)'s video within the game by sneaking a peek beside [Juliet Watson](juliet.md) and [Brooke Scott](brooke.md) in the hallway of the Girl's side of the [Prescott Dormitory](prescott_dormitory.md) the morning of "[Episode 2: Out of Time](out_of_time.md)", it is unintelligible and cannot be watched. Any player who attempts to access the link to the site in real life is provided with the following official Easter egg: **http://katesvid.com/ **is an actual link that leads to a blog with a single post and a video that was "removed" by Youtube, linking to the fact that Victoria took the video down after Kate's suicide attempt. It now redirects to the Life Is Strange homepage on Square Enix's website.
[File:Katesvid.jpg](centre.md)On a side note, the website was registered on January 26, 2015 — only four days before the release of the first episode of *Life is Strange*.https://who.is/whois/katesvid.com

## Keep Yourself Clean like Max 

The sign reading "showers open" on the bathroom door shows a girl seen from behind whose haircut is eerily similar to Max's. Given the fact that women are generally depicted with long hair or easily recognizable feminine hairstyles on gender pictograms, it probably is an Easter Egg.
