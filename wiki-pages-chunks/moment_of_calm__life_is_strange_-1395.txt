And I feel so guilty for putting Chloe and her family through this. I could give Chloe the choice of keeping [William Price](william.md) alive, but that would be cruel. But then I see that they're a family again, and... who am I to judge?"

How can I explain to my best friend that I put her in a wheelchair just to euthanize her... and then I had to let her father die again? So... no fucking way. Chloe has enough excuses to hate the world. But if my [The Storm](tornado.md) vision is true, then we might not have a world after this week…"

The more I use my power, the more I see how little control I have over what happens. Now Max Caulfield exists in two or maybe three different realities... How can I have a destiny?"
Accepted Chloe's requestAccepted Chloe's request"If these alternate lives exist, I hate the thought of William and [Joyce](joyce.md) finding Chloe like that. Thinking about all these lifelines almost makes my head hurt worse than the rewind."

I don’t think I’ll ever know how much destiny I’m changing… But who ever said we only have a single fate? Time travel is such a mindfuck…"

Enter the [Vortex Club](vortex_club.md). Look at these entitled assholes... they don’t give a shit about anybody. If that tornado came right now, I would just sit here and watch for a while. But I have to make sure Chloe doesn’t go on her own rampage… I hate feeling this way... dark and angry…"
