*Max and Chloe wait for the train to pass, as they are on opposite sides of the track. After the train passes, Chloe hugs Max.*
	
		**Max:** You okay?

		**Chloe:** You saved me again! Crazy. Now we're totally bonded for life!

		**Max:** Damn, that was close.
		
	

**Chloe:** Aren't you glad I took you away to a nice quiet, desolate spot?

*Chloe and Max hug as they walk back along the tracks.*

**Max:** It was cool to spend time in your lair, but...I have to get back to school before my next class...

**Chloe:** Since you're the mysterious superhero, I'll be your faithful chauffeur and companion.

**Max:** My powers might not last, Chloe...

**Chloe:** That's okayâ€”we will. Forever.

*Chloe drives Max to the entrance of Blackwell. The weather has begun to get rainy.*

**Max:** Thanks for the ride, Chloe. Right on time for my art lesson.

**Chloe:** Thanks for coming with me. Sorry to be so boring...

**Max:** Nothing exciting ever happens to us, right?

**Chloe:** Listen, your rewind power has to be connected to that snow yesterday. That might explain your tornado vision...

Explain what?# Explain what?**Max:** Explain what? Snow equals a ginormous twister that takes out Arcadia Bay? You're high.

|-|I doubt it...I doubt it...**Max:** I don't see how. It's so friggin' random...

**Chloe:** Wake up, Max. You saved my life twice now. You altered the course of my destiny, yours, and whoever! Do you know about Chaos Theory?

What do you know?# What do you know?**Max:** What do you know about Chaos Theory, Miss "I Hate Math"?

**Chloe:** Five years ago, asswipe. Some people change...and your situation is the perfect storm for quantum physics.

|-|Uh...Uh...**Max:** Uh...it means "shit happens," right?

**Chloe:** No, "crazy shit happens." Because it can. And will.

**Max:** Why me? I'm just a geek girl in some small town...

**Chloe:** A perfect example of "strange attractors." Don't they teach you kids anything at Blackwell? We have a tornado, rewind power, and freak snow...hello, Armageddon! So let's party with your power, rock star!

**Max:** Like you said, Professor Price: a superhero needs a sidekick.

**Chloe:** How can it be such a shitty week and yet one of the best of my life?

**Max:** Because we're back in action again!

*The pair high-five and bump fists before Max exits the truck. Max waves goodbye as Chloe drives away.*
