Here is a section of the wiki page for Rachel Amber:

## Alternative Timeline 
In the [Alternative Timeline](alternative_timeline.md), not much is known about Rachel, but she is still missing, and probably already dead as in the original timeline. We can find newspaper articles on her, which show that finding her is still a public issue. An article says that, contrary to the original timeline, the police and FBI are still investigating. The article also says that "family and friends have intensified the search" for Rachel and that her family even offered a reward for any information. Rachel's case has even caught the interest of a national reality show revolving around missing person cases.

Chloe and Rachel had never met in the alternative timeline but Chloe reveals that she read about her in the newspaper when Max asks.

## Relationships 
#

## Friends 
* [Chloe Price](chloe_price.md) - Rachel was Chloe's best friend while Max was away in Seattle, and the one who rejuvenated her life after her father died and Max left her behind. The two shared a very strong bond according to Chloe, who is desperate to uncover the reason for her disappearance. The two often got into varying degrees of mischief and spent a lot of time in Chloe's "secret hideout." Chloe developed a deep trust in Rachel and planned to leave Arcadia Bay for good with her once they paid off Frank Bowers, but she disappeared before they could do so. There are numerous mementos of Chloe and Rachel's friendship in their hideout and in Chloe's room, which proves their deep bond and Rachel's central role in Chloe's life. However, Rachel kept her relationship with Frank from Chloe, and Chloe feels betrayed when she finds out about it. *(See [Chloe and Rachel](here.md) for more information on their relationship.)*
* [Evan Harris](evan_harris.md) - According to Evan, he and Rachel were close like brother and sister, although he didn't like her Vortex Club friends and she didn't seem to care about that. He always felt understood by Rachel and never judged. He regularly took photos of Rachel who he thought was his favorite model at Blackwell, because she always knew "what angles worked best with his eyes".
*[Justin Williams](justin_williams.md) and [Trevor](trevor.md) - Rachel used to hang out with Justin, Trevor and their skater friends prior to her disappearance. She stopped spending time with them after she went missing.
* [Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md) (?) - As both Vortex Club members, they very likely hung out together frequently. Nathan seems to be happy to see her when he mistakes Max with Rachel. He also seems to know a lot about her relationship with Frank Bowers. It might be that they had a rather good relationship before her disappearance. On the other hand, he accused her of drug dealing prior to her disappearance, and, as revealed in episode five by Mark Jefferson, Nathan was apparently in lust with Rachel and drugged her to follow Jefferson's footsteps, but accidentally killed her by giving her an overdose.
* [:Category:Blackwell Academy Students](blackwell_students.md) - It's clear that Rachel was a very popular person, and was well-liked by most of Blackwell's student body, as well as the faculty.

#

## Family 
Although never appearing in the original game by [Don't Nod](don_t_nod.md), Rachel's family is a key part of the plot of the prequel game *[Life is Strange: Before the Storm](life_is_strange__before_the_storm.md)* by [Deck Nine Games](deck_nine_games.md). *(See [Rachel Amber (Before the Storm)](this_page.md) for further details.)*

Chloe says that Rachel's parents were in denial over Rachel being "missing".Max: "What about her parents? Are they looking for her?" - Chloe: "They're in denial. Max, I know she's missing." (Episode 1 - Chloe's room.) At the point of the game's plot setting in, there are no signs of her parents actively looking for her. Chloe mentions Rachel staying over at her place regularly, though does never mention her parents or her place apart from the remark above, which might hint at a complicated family situation. The nightmare sequence in Episode furthermore implies that Rachel may have had a dorm room at Blackwell Academy despite living in Arcadia Bay; it's unclear whether this supports the problematic family background thesis, however the same is the case for Nathan Prescott.

#

## Enemies 
* [Victoria Chase](victoria_chase.md) - Rachel does not appear to be liked by Victoria, and this may be a jealous rivalry of sorts due to Rachel's popularity with other students and members of the Vortex Club. In the cutscene at the end of Episode 1, Victoria is seen pulling a Rachel Amber missing poster from out of a student notice board before throwing it to the ground in disgust. It is not seen but implied that she may also do this with the second poster that's on display. Victoria also keeps one of these missing posters in her room that she has vandalized in red pen with the word "bitch". However, when Max asks [Hayden Jones](hayden_jones.md) - a member of the Vortex Club - if Victoria liked Rachel, Hayden says, "She respected Rachel, even if she didn't act like it."
* [Truck Driver](truck_driver.md) - A trucker who frequents the Two Whales Diner appears to have an unfavorable opinion of Rachel, telling a curious Max that he only knew her from the diner and that "she was just a gold digger. She belonged in California with all those... you know whats... good riddance."
