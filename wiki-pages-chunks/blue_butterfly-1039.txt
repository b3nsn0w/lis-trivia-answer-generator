The **Blue Butterfly** is a spirit-like entity that makes its first appearance in the girls bathroom at [Blackwell Academy](blackwell_academy.md) in "[Episode 1: Chrysalis](chrysalis.md)" and reappears in an optional ending montage of "[Episode 5: Polarized](polarized.md)." Throughout the game, there are other depictions of blue butterflies.

## Episode One - "[Episode 1: Chrysalis](chrysalis.md)" 
After her photography class, [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) goes to take a time-out in the girls bathroom to recover from her anxiety over not yet submitting an entry for the [Everyday Heroes Photo Contest](everyday_heroes_contest.md). She takes out the photo she has hesitated to enter before tearing it up and throwing the pieces to the floor.

Seconds later, a blue butterfly flutters in from an open window at the far end of the bathroom. Max follows it with curiosity to see it land on the edge of a metal bucket in a corner behind the row of stalls. This provides Max with a rare photo opportunity as she thinks the butterfly doesn't look like any kind she has seen before. As she takes a photo with her [Max's Camera](camera.md), she thinks the blue wings are practically glowing and she can almost feel the air moving around her as though she's in the presence of a spirit.

As soon as its picture is taken, the butterfly leaves the bucket and flutters back in the direction it came from as [Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md) enters the bathroom. Max stays hidden behind the row of stalls as it settles on one of the sinks. A blue-haired girl enters the bathroom moments after Nathan, and the butterfly can be seen facing in their direction as though it is watching. 
When Nathan shoots the girl, Max steps out from behind the stall and holds up her hand, shouting, "NO!" Time immediately slows down before quickly rewinding. She finds herself back to an earlier moment when she was present in her photography class.

Discovering that she now has the power to [rewind](rewind.md), Max quickly heads back to the bathroom to retrace her steps to save the girl from getting shot, completely unaware at this time that the girl is her childhood best friend, [Chloe Price](chloe_price.md).

## Episode Five - "[Episode 5: Polarized](polarized.md)" 
In the Sacrifice Chloe ending, the blue butterfly flutters down to land on Chloe's coffin. Max appears to look in its direction and smiles slightly.

## Historical 
Butterflies are commonly associated with personal growth and transformation as well as transitioning to a new phase (in life), such as the transition from childhood to adulthood. Transition starts in the form of a chrysalis - the title of the first episode. A chrysalis is symbolic of the changes Max undergoes before she matures into a more confident version of herself.

For Christians, butterflies are a symbol of rebirth.[https://owlcation.com/social-sciences/Butterflies-Symbols-of-Life-and-Hope Butterflies: Symbols of Life and Hope] (January 11, 2018)
