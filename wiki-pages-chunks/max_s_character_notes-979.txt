Here is a section of the wiki page for Max's Character Notes:

*Talking to Joyce Price after five years was almost as intense as seeing Chloe again. Especially right back in "ye olde" Two Whales Diner. That clinking of silverware and the smell of sizzling bacon rewound me back to being a kid, hanging out there with my parents for breakfast. I remember her always smiling at Chloe, even in mischief. Doubt she smiles at her hijinks now, but they still banter like mother and daughter.*

*I moved to Seattle so soon after William died that I never saw how it affected Joyce. I'm glad she's not pissed at me for being selfish and never looking back. I still remember the last time Chloe and I saw him alive. I wonder how often Joyce relives that day? That's the worst kind of rewind: one you can't control. But if I could go back to that moment... what would I do?*

*I can only imagine how Joyce ended up with David Madsen. Talk about opposites. You can tell she loves him—disturbing as that sounds. Maybe she just wanted a more structured life for herself... Obviously it didn't work out that way with Chloe. I hope they both treat her right. Joyce deserves the best.*

*I'll never forget Frank—if only because he's the first and last person I will ever aim a gun at. How did Chloe end up in this sketchy drug dealer's orbit? The weird thing is that when I first saw him threatening Chloe in the junkyard, I was more shocked how un-creepy he looked. I expected some try-hard gangster, but he looked more like a dumpster diving troll. Which I guess he kinda is since we were on his turf, testing out my rewind skills for Chloe's amusement.*

*Though he didn't look like a serial killer, his vibe (aura, energy, whateva) was BAD. I could literally feel the hair on my arms prickling. He wanted the money Chloe owed him, so it didn't make sense he would hurt her but I wasn't going to take a chance... So yes, I actually threatened him with David's gun. Ridiculous. Fortunately none of us ended up like "Reservoir Dogs" and I saw that maybe Frank isn't as scary as I thought...*

*But I don't want Chloe near him EVER again. Since he was wearing one of Rachel Amber's bracelets for WTF reasons, I doubt Chloe will be partying with him anymore. But he's at the top of our suspect list now...'' ## Trivia 
*The photographs that feature character notes are shots taken from the first encounter/conversation with the addressed person. They are the same photos that appear as their contact pictures on Max's mobile phone. 
**The photo that features Max's self introduction is a shot from the scene where Max leans against the Blackwell corridor wall listening to "[To All of You](to_all_of_you.md)" by Syd Matters after leaving Jefferson's class in [Episode 1: Chrysalis](episode_1__chrysalis.md).
**The photo that features [Mark Jefferson](mr__jefferson.md)'s character note is a shot from the scene where Max first talks to him after his class ended in Episode 1.
**The character notes for [Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md) will appear in Max's journal after she finds a photograph in [Chloe Price](chloe_price.md)'s bedroom that features Chloe and Rachel posing together. The photograph of Rachel on her character notes page matches Chloe's photograph. This suggests that Max has taken a photograph of this picture with her camera. An unused image file originally intended for use in Max's character notes is a black and white photograph of Rachel from her 'missing' poster, taken at an angle.
*One of two possible sticker graphics will be added to [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md)'s character notes in Max's journal, depending on her fate at the end of [Episode 2: Out of Time](episode_2__out_of_time.md).
