## Garibaldi Picture 
When Max goes back in time to the year 2008, there is a picture on the refrigerator of a sailing boat with the word "Garibaldi" beneath it. It appears that this may be based on the title image of the [http://visitgaribaldi.com/ "Visit Garibaldi"] tourism website. (It is also present on the refrigerator in the 2013 alternative timeline.) Garibaldi, in turn, is one of the towns that inspired the town of Arcadia Bay.

## Alternative Reality 
*During a conversation with Alternative Chloe, Max mentions the two of them watched *{{Wiki|Power Rangers}}* as children.
* When Max looks at Chloe's IV drip, she makes a reference to the {{Wiki|Mighty Morphin Power Rangers}}: "That must be her mighty morphine machine..."
*Joyce's aunt, [Dorothy](aunt_dorothy.md), is believed to be a reference to {{Wiki|L. Frank Baum}}'s {{Wiki|Dorothy Gale}} from *{{Wiki|The Wizard of Oz}}*.
*In a letter addressed to William and Joyce by Ray Wells, Wells suggests taking Chloe to "Miskatonic Institute", a school that caters to disabled persons. In {{Wiki|H.P. Lovecraft}}'s {{Wiki|Cthulhu Mythos}}, {{Wiki|Miskatonic University}} is a fictional university that first appeared in the 1922 story, *{{Wiki|Herbert West–Reanimator}}*.
*In an article discussing the Prescott Family, the writer's name is Craig Kennedy. {{Wiki|Craig Kennedy|Professor Craig Kennedy}} is a character that was featured in eighteen detective novels and 82 short stories written by {{Wiki|Arthur B. Reeve}} and published in {{Wiki|Cosmopolitan_(magazine)|Cosmopolitan magazine}} between 1910 and 1918. Professor Craig Kennedy is often referred to as "The American Sherlock Holmes".
*In a letter to Joyce from the Arcadia Bay Spinal Center, Dr. Anton Phibes details the alternative Chloe Price's deteriorating respiratory system. Dr. Anton Phibes was a character in the 1971 British horror film *{{Wiki|The Abominable Dr. Phibes}}*.
*The alternative Price family is apparently indebted to Donald Clamp lenders, which might be a reference to the corrupt local Clamp corporation from *{{wiki|Gremlins 2}}.*
*On Alternative Chloe's computer, Max can find a conversation in an online chatroom with someone who's about to start watching *{{Wiki|Quantum Leap}}*.
*Alternative Chloe refers to herself as "Chloe of the Caribbean", which is a reference to the movie *{{Wiki|Pirates of the Caribbean}}*.
*When discussing {{Wiki|Ridley Scott}}'s *{{Wiki|Blade Runner}}*, an adaptation of {{Wiki|Philip K. Dick}}'s novel *{{Wiki|Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?}},* Alternative Chloe mentions she wanted to dye her hair like {{Wiki|List of Blade Runner characters#Pris Stratton|Pris}} had. Pris, however, never dyed the ends of her bangs.
*Alternative Chloe asks Max whether or not she believed {{Wiki|Rick Deckard|Deckard}} was a {{Wiki|Replicant}}. The question is part of a longstanding discussion that began following the release of the film in 1982. The "Final Cut" learns heavily toward the argument supporting the Deckard-Replicant angle. {{Wiki|Ridley Scott}} has stated multiple times that Deckard was, in fact, a Replicant from the beginning.
*Alternative Chloe refers to her morphine injector as "total {{Wiki|Star Trek}} shit", referencing the series' fictional {{Wiki|Hypospray|hypospray}}, an injector which doesn't use a needle.
*Alternative Chloe tells Max, "Hope you’re not jealous of all my tech toys...", to which Max responds with, "I'm blown away, Tony Stark...", which is a reference to Tony Stark a.k.a. {{wiki|Iron Man}} from Marvel comics who is a wealthy businessman and scientist/inventor.
*In her diary, Max mentions Vangelis, the composer of the much known Blade Runner soundtrack.
*When Max returns from the bathroom with the morphine, Chloe says, "Finally. Give me the blue pill…". This is may be a reference to {{Wiki|The Matrix}} where the blue pill allows a state of blissful ignorance/illusion. There is also the fact to consider that some of the most commonly used morphine pills are blue.
*Chloe says to Max, "Wish I could build us a... DeLorean." This is a reference to the time machine used in *Back to the Future*.

*The moth on Max's t-shirt is a reference to the {{Wiki|Death’s-Head Hawkmoth}} featured in the theatrical poster for the 1992 film *{{Wiki|The Silence of the Lambs (film)|Silence of the Lambs}}*, and it may serve to symbolize the importance of death in this episode.
*When looking at Chloe's wastebasket, she says, "Even Holmes and Watson didn't use every piece of information", referencing to {{Wiki|Sherlock Holmes}}.
