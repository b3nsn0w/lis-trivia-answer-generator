Here is a section of the wiki page for References (Life is Strange):

## Vortex Club Party 
*The End of the World Party is likely referencing a party with the same name featured in *{{Wiki|The Rules of Attraction (film)|The Rules of Attraction}}*, a film already referenced in a vehicle license plate in Episode 3.
*After taking a selfie with a drunk Warren outside the party, he apologizes and justifies his actions by saying, "Sorry... I just wanted to feel like a normal student after this week's ultraviolence." {{Wiki|Ultraviolence}} is a term coined by Anthony Burgess in his novel *{{Wiki|A Clockwork Orange}}*.
*At the [End of the World Party](end_of_the_world_party.md), when talking with [Brooke Scott](brooke_scott.md) about superpowers, Max says, "With great power comes great bullshit", which is a reference to {{Wiki|Spider-Man}}'s uncle's famous line, "With great power there must also come great responsibility".
*If Max convinced Daniel to attend the Vortex Club party, both him and Brooke mention going to see a "Miyazaki" exhibit, presumably {{Wiki|Hayao Miyazaki}} of {{Wiki|Studio Ghibli}}.
*After failing to convince [Sarah](sarah.md) to let her in the VIP section, Max goes to [Courtney Wagner](courtney_wagner.md) for help and tells her that "Zuul the Gatekeeper won't let her pass". Zuul is a character from the film *{{Wiki|Ghostbusters}}*.
*Max makes a reference to the film *{{Wiki|Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie}}* when she reads the graffiti on a wall that says "Fuck your selfie" in the Vortex Club Party VIP section. The protagonist of this film goes berserk on a party held by her popular school mates and kills everyone.
*During Max's conversation with Alyssa about Kate, Alyssa says "{{Wiki|So it goes}}", which is a line repeated in Kurt Vonnegut's novel *{{Wiki|Slaughterhouse Five}}*.
*If Max talks to Justin at the Vortex Club party he'll refer to Max as "Maximum Overdrive", a reference to the same-titled Stephen King film.
*Looking at a drunk guy in the toilets, Max comments "Goodnight, sweet prince", which is another reference to *Hamlet*.
*The game Brooke is playing on her phone is likely a reference to *{{Wiki|Candy Crush Saga}}*. This is further supported by the texture's name, *CadyCrash*.

## Episode Five - "[Episode 5: Polarized](polarized.md)"

## Plane 
* The redhead man sitting in front of Max (who is probably a reference to [Michel Koch](michel_koch.md)) is seen playing a video game which looks a lot like {{Wiki|Candy Crush}}, the most famous match-3 game at the moment. The game files reveal that the game is actually called "CadyCrash", making the reference even more obvious.

#

## Zeitgeist Gallery 
* A series of sculptures in the San Francisco [Zeitgeist Gallery](zeitgeist_gallery.md) seem to depict {{Wiki|John Cleese}}'s signature *{{Wiki|Ministry of Silly Walks}}* walk. When Max looks at the one on the left she says, "That one looks kinda silly." These sculptures are also highly reminiscent of those of expressionist A. Giacometti. In the game files, the model of the sculpture is named "SillyGiaco" which is hinting at both of these references.
* One of the art exhibits at the Zeitgeist Gallery is a picture of a person's cybernetic arm similar to Adam Jensen's, the protagonist of *{{Wiki|Deus Ex: Human Revolution}}*.
* One of Max's thoughts while at the Zeitgeist Gallery is: *"How much would I charge if somebody wanted to buy my picture... Whoa, slow down, Max Warhol."* Here Max compares herself to {{Wiki|Andy Warhol}}.
* The "This is water" graffiti that is visible outside the gallery might be reference to the homonymous {{Wiki|This Is Water|commencement speech}} by {{Wiki|David Foster Wallace}}.
* In the gallery's lobby, Max can see a pamphlet for a lecture about dystopias, with examples like *Metropolis*, *Planet of the Apes*, *Blade Runner*, and *The Hunger Games*.
* Max also sees a newspaper article about a person called "[Daniel Lee](danny_lee.md)". This name could refer to a New Zealand golfer who often takes selfies. In one article he is even referred to as the "No. 1 golfer in the world /when it comes to selfies)".Said Danny Lee article: http://www.golfdigest.com/story/danny-lee-is-the-no-1-golfer-in-the-world-when-it-comes-to-taking-selfies Max can meet a journalist with the same name at the gallery.
* The journalist Danny Lee states that he is currently editing the art section of the "Berkeley People's Herald". His phrase about the "Berkeley People's Herald" might be a reference to the film *{{Wiki|Big Trouble in Little China}}*. (See [http://www.subzin.com/quotes/M973191e3/Big+Trouble+in+Little+China/I%27m+Margo+Litzenberger.+I%27m+with+the+Berkeley+People%27s+Herald. here] for the quote).
* Many of the "Everyday Heroes Contest" winners share surnames with famous sci-fi writers, such as: Atwood, Ballard, Chabon, Cline, Eggers, Levin, McCarthy, Pynchon, and Vonnegut
* The guestbook at the Zeitgeist Gallery has an entry written by someone named "Lisa Simpsons", a possible reference to the TV series *{{Wiki|The Simpsons}}* considering Lisa being known for her interest in art and science.
