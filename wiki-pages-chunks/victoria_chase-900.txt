Here is a section of the wiki page for Victoria Chase:

## Biography 
The following is what Max wrote about Victoria in [Max's Journal](her_journal.md):

''And how could I forget Victoria Chase? Rich, stylish, entitled. I could feel INSTANT JUDGEMENT when she looked at my raggedy ass clothes. As if I'm at Blackwell to strike fashion poses... Maybe I'm being extra crispy sensitive, but I think Victoria wants life here to be like her own reality show. Ugh...*

*Then there's Victoria Chase, the elite of Blackwell Academy, and a total bitch. And I hate saying that. I just don't know why somebody who's so rich and beautiful needs to be so fucking mean. 18 year olds at prestigious academy should be evolving into artists and scholars... not reality show contestants. Victoria does everything for maximum drama. She actually wastes her time calling me out in class and taunting [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md).*

*For reals? I wish her parents could see her in action. They'd cut off that trust fund fast. Then again, she's in the Vortex Club, and they seem to own the school, so maybe that's why she doesn't give a shit.*

*The odd thing is that she does know art and photography. She can even say all those French names that break my tongue. Her work is a little cold, but she has a good eye.*

*She also has an eye for Mr. Jefferson, which is so obvious that I'm embarrassed for her.*

*She does everything but sit in his lap. He keeps his distance though. We can all tell she's trying to win the "[Everyday Heroes Photo Contest](everyday_hero.md)" contest. I'm sure it drives her crazy when there's somebody she can't buy or seduce. Ha!''

## Background 
Victoria comes from a very wealthy background, similar to [Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md). Her parents own the "Chase Space", a famous gallery in her hometown Seattle that Max is impressed by. Just like most of the other students, she came to Blackwell due to her admiration of photography teacher Mark Jefferson. In 2009, she attended one of Jefferson's exhibitions at the [Bean Hip Cafe](bean_hip_cafe.md), and she even bought a book featuring his photography work. She feels distinctly pressured by her parents and their careers; she comments on how aware she is about the struggles of the cut-throat photography business. Aspiring to join the fashion industry as a photographer in later life, she submitted her portfolio to galleries such as theÂ [Kroft Gallery](kroft_gallery.md) but got rejected.

Victoria is a prominent member of the [Vortex Club](vortex_club.md) and very influential at Blackwell. According to her [Media:Academy Record Victoria.jpg](blackwell_student_record.md), Victoria is an honored student and considered "the golden standard" for Blackwell Academy by [Raymond Wells](principal_wells.md) due to her consistently high GPA of 3.9.

She is resentful towards [Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md), which is evident from the defaced Missing Person poster in her bedroomThat is probably due to Rachel having been in a (sexual) relationship with Mr. Jefferson who Victoria seems to have a crush on. She is probably also responsible for writings on the girls' bathroom's walls like "Rachel is a whore"., and her tearing down of Rachel's Missing Person poster at the very end of [Episode 1: Chrysalis](episode_1__chrysalis.md). Hayden comments that she respected Rachel despite not showing it. We know they hung out together frequently in the Vortex Club.

Victoria has expensive taste, donning designer clothing from Dior and Givenchy. Her browsing for a 3D printer tempts Max to hang out with her more, despite the materialistic reasoning.

Victoria attended a Vortex Club party on October 4, 2013, when [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md) got intoxicated by Nathan Prescott and later was abducted to the Dark Room. At that party, Victoria filmed Kate kissing several strangers and eventually published the video online spreading the news of the video throughout Blackwell.
