## Hallway 
The most notable difference between the girls' and boys' dorm hallways is that of the graffiti and general untidiness. The boys have no shame in scrawling everywhere, blocking out signs with rules, and making sexual jokes about other students. The chart with the room allocations is completely destroyed with graffiti, leaving Max to find [Nathan Prescott](nathan.md)'s room with no assistance from it.Although she can simply be sent the room number by Kate Marsh if she is still alive, and if Max confronted her about Nathan during her [hospital](hospital.md) visit. As with the girls' dorm, the boys have individual room slates.
