Here is a section of the wiki page for Maxine Caulfield:

## Episode Five - "[Episode 5: Polarized](polarized.md)"
Max is held captive inside the bunker with Mark Jefferson, but by using her powers, she manages to escape into a photograph. Emerging back at the beginning of Jefferson's class, it is made possible for her to inform David Madsen of her kidnapper's identity - Jefferson is caught, Chloe is rescued and Max is awarded the opportunity to go to [San Francisco](san_francisco.md) and her photograph displayed in an art gallery. She calls Chloe from the event, realizing that in spite of all her efforts, the storm is still in existence as it reaches Arcadia Bay. Max uses her powers to go back in time to the taking of the gallery photo, which eventually leads her to sojourn alternative realities as they devolve into a dreamscape nightmare.

Waking up from her nightmare, she finds herself with Chloe, on the way to the lighthouse. When Chloe and Max reach the lighthouse, safe and out of the way of the incoming tornado, Chloe realizes that Max saving her at the start of the week in the bathroom was the one event that has caused all of these [Meteorological Anomalies](strange_meteorological_occurrences.md) to happen. In the end, Max is left with her final and biggest choice: Go back into the photo of the blue butterfly, letting Chloe die and saving Arcadia Bay, or rip up the photo and save Chloe, leaving Arcadia Bay destroyed and probably most of its residents and her friends to die.

If Max decides to save the town, Max will kiss or hug Chloe before she rewinds for the final time, depending on earlier choices on whether she kissed Chloe earlier or whether she defended and took Chloe's side enough throughout in previous episodes. With their final farewells, Max uses the photograph of the blue butterfly to return to the point where Nathan Prescott shot and killed Chloe in the bathroom in Blackwell. Only this time, Max does not intervene on Nathan. Mark Jefferson and Nathan were eventually arrested and questioned for their role in the deaths of Chloe and Rachel Amber. Time-lapsing a few days later, the town is completely restored to normal without the ominous signs from the dead animals. Max attends Chloe's funeral at the cemetery close to the lighthouse, with David, Joyce, Frank, Pompidou, Warren, Kate, Justin, Trevor, Victoria, and Dana among the attendees. During the ceremony, a blue butterfly will land on top of Chloe's coffin before flying away.

If Max decides to save Chloe, she takes the photograph and rips it in half, already desiring that she could not lose Chloe yet again and give her another shot in life. The storm subsides but Arcadia Bay is in ruins when the two return to the town in Chloe's truck. The two are last seen leaving Arcadia Bay and driving off into the distance.

## Altered Timeline (Life is Strange)
In the [Alternative Timeline (Life is Strange)](alternative_timeline.md), Max appears to be a different person after "[Episode 3: Chaos Theory](chaos_theory.md)". Her clothes are different, more up-market, and she is seen hanging around with members of the Vortex Club, people she previously stayed clear of. She's especially good friends with Victoria and Nathan who, according to [Max's Diary#Alternative Timeline (Life is Strange)](max_s_diary.md), helped her make her style more "fashionable" and celebrated her 18th birthday with her.

Victoria seems to be friendly and cautious around Max, calling her Maxine and becoming worried when she is corrected with the "Max-Never-Maxine" rule; Max also refers to herself as Maxine in texts to Chloe, proving that she is definitely a different person since letting Chloe's father live. The [Max's Messages#Alternative Timeline (Life is Strange)](texts.md) Max receives from Nathan and Victoria, as well as Taylor, indicating that she could have replaced Victoria as the "Queen-Bee" of Blackwell. Nathan texts her about hanging out and, according to Victoria's texts, is worried about her since she ran off. Furthermore, Max has clearly supported Taylor during a rough time with her mother's surgery. Alyssa also seems disappointed in her, commenting that she is disappointed that Max hung out with the popular students.

In this timeline, she seems to be more rebellious than usual, is often partying and drinking, and participates in taking drugs (Victoria offers her the chance for a smoke in the ladies room, and talks about scoring more drugs in a text). Although she still seems to have a caring relationship with her mother, Max is more snippy towards her and troubles her with high expenses.

Max had very little interest in her diary since moving back to Arcadia Bay. Her lack of attachment to it could be due to her confidence and new flourishing social life as a member of the Vortex Club, combined with the social stigma of keeping a diary at her age.

In the alternative timeline, Max kept in touch with Chloe through letters. She also sent texts to her in August before leaving for Blackwell. However, William is surprised to see her when answering the door, implying that she did not, in fact, keep in touch as much as she meant to. Max's diary entries and text messages reveal that Max only marginally thought about rekindling with Chloe since she's been back at Blackwell and that she has been more interested in partying with her new friends. Unlike their first meeting in the original timeline where she is accusatory and apprehensive towards Max, Chloe seems genuinely happy to see her best friend again. She is slightly abrasive when she mentions that writing is easier than visiting and dealing with awkward conversations about the accident.

It has also been revealed in a text to Nathan that “alternative” Max used a dark room to work on a photo assignment. It is unknown if this room is the same as Mr. Jefferson's Dark Room, but it is more likely to be a regular darkroom used for photography.
