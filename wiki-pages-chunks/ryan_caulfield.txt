In another [Max's Messages#Dad_4](text_message.md) to Max in the changed reality where Max has won the [Everyday Heroes Photo Contest](everyday_heroes_photo_contest.md), he points out that Max is an adult now and can tell her mother that she doesn't need to be too worried regarding the arrest of [Mark Jefferson](mark_jefferson.md) and [Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md).
