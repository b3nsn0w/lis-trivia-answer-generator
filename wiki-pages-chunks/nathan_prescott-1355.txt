Here is a section of the wiki page for Nathan Prescott:

## Episode One - "[Episode 1: Chrysalis](chrysalis.md)" 
In his first appearance, Nathan walks into the girls bathroom and begins talking to himself, visibly stressed. He fails to realize is that he is not alone in the bathroom, as Max had entered a few moments before and is hiding behind the row of stalls.

After staring into the mirror and giving himself a prep-talk, a [Chloe Price](blue_haired_girl.md) enters and begins to demand money from him. Nathan is quick to respond that it's his family that's very wealthy, not him. The blue-haired girl, unconvinced by Nathan's reply, threatens to expose his drug dealing to his family and his mental instability to "everybody". This prompts Nathan to pull out a gun, startling the girl, which leads Nathan to push her into the wall while he holds the gun at waist level. Nathan then rants about how he is "so sick of people trying to control [him]". It is then that she pushes Nathan. He accidentally triggers the gun, and when she dies, he says, ''"No, please... god, no... I-I didn't mean to. You just kept pushing me. Everybody is always pushing me. Sorry... I'm so, so sorry... My life is hell. And I'm so busted."''

However, Max reverses time to the point before the girl is shot. As the situation is replayed, Max is able to save the girl by setting off the fire alarm which in turn gives the girl a chance to escape before the gunshot. If Max fails to set the fire alarm off, Nathan can be seen kneeling down, cursing and shaking the girl, regretful of his decision.

After Max successfully saves the girl, Nathan slips on Max's torn photo while trying to stand up before grabbing his gun and exiting the girls bathroom. When Max leaves the bathroom, she is interrupted by the security guard, [David Madsen](david_madsen.md), and then [Raymond Wells](principal_wells.md), who she can then tell about Nathan with the gun or hide the truth.

Regardless of Max's choice, Nathan will confront Max in the parking lot, demanding to know what she told the Principal and/or what she saw in the bathroom depending on the decision made with Wells. However, his tone is much friendlier and respectful if Max hid the truth during the conversation with Principle Wells. Similarly, depending on the dialogue chosen, Nathan will say different things. Ultimately, no matter what choice and dialogue is chosen, Nathan will become offended and say, *"Do not analyze me! I pay people for that,"* implying that he is in therapy.

[Warren Graham](warren_graham.md) intervenes in the confrontation and Nathan headbutts him to the ground. Max reaches to pull Nathan away from Warren which only results in Nathan grabbing Max by her throat and exclaiming, *"Nobody tells me what to do. Not my parents, not the Principal, or that whore in the bathroom."*

The girl Max saved in the bathroom suddenly pulls up in a [Chloe's Truck](truck.md) and Max instantly recognizes her as her former best friend, Chloe Price. Warren then pushes Nathan to the ground to stop him from attacking Max and Chloe and is beaten for it. Nathan can briefly be seen punching Warren in the face repeatedly before Max jumps into Chloe's truck just as Nathan kicks the door closed, letting the two escape. David Madsen then runs up to Nathan and Warren to stop the fight.

Chloe reveals that Nathan is dealing drugs in Blackwell, but that he uses laxatives to cut the product down. As the conversation continues, Chloe declares that she was drugged by Nathan. On a night out, she attempted to get him drunk in order to steal his money. However, after returning to his dorm, he apparently slipped something in her drink without her noticing, leading her to pass out. When she awoke, she saw him "crawling" towards her with a camera. This motivated Chloe to kick at him and causing her to accidentally break his lamp, which startled Nathan enough to give her a chance to escape.

Nathan is absent for the rest of the episode until the final montage, where he is sitting alone with a camera, not paying any attention to the falling snow as the episode ends.

## Episode Two - "[Episode 2: Out of Time](out_of_time.md)" 
If Max reported Nathan, he will vandalize [Max's Room](max_s_room.md) in the morning while she is in the shower, writing "Nobody messes with me, bitch" on Max's photo wall, and leaving a disturbing picture on Max's bed. If Max hid the truth, then the room remains untouched and it's assumed that Nathan never broke into Max's room.

Later, in [Mark Jefferson](mr__jefferson.md)'s classroom, he and Victoria are sitting on Max's desk and talking about her. When approached by Max, the conversation that occurs is dependent on Max's interactions with both Victoria and Nathan. Afterwards, the two let Max sit in her seat and continue their conversation in the corner of the room before Nathan is forced to leave the classroom as Mr. Jefferson begins class.

When [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md) is on the roof and Max freezes time in front of the Dormitories in order to save her, Nathan can be seen looking up with a strange expression on his face.

After Kate's suicide (or suicide attempt), Nathan is sitting beside Max in [Raymond Wells](principal_wells_.md) office due to his responsibility as the organizer of Vortex Club parties and his appearance in Kate's infamous video. If Max blames Nathan for dosing Kate, he will either be suspended from Blackwell Academy or still in school with Max being suspended, depending on earlier choices. If not blamed at all, he will try to muddy Kate's reputation by stating that she shouldn't have asked to be "on a video macking on dudes".

At the end of the episode, he walks into [Victoria's Room](victoria_s_room.md) and sees her crying. He seems to be smiling and lets himself in so he can comfort her.
