##  Lyrics 
:I don't know 
:What to do?
:If I may, grant me just one thing
:The memories to recall

:Hide and seek
:Hide and seek
:I'll play hide and seek

:Hide and seek 
:Hide and seek
:My memories of you

:Empty walls
:True or false
:Only sorrow knows
:Where pleasant moments hide

:My heart can't rest
:Unless I do my best
:My heart can't rest
:Unless I do my best

:My memories
:My memories
:o ho oh
:My memories of you

:My memories
:My memories
:o ho oh
:My memories of you
