## **Swimming Pool** 
*Max and Chloe enter the swimming pool building.*

**Max:** We're in the Otters' lair!

**Chloe:** Big fucking deal. I want that heated water!

(Max was suspended)(Max was suspended)**Max:** We still have to play it cool, okay? Even if I'm suspended.
|-|(Max wasn't suspended)# (Max wasn't suspended)**Max:** We still have to play it cool, okay? I still go to school here.

**Chloe:** You can own this hellhole once you figure out your rewind power...

*Chloe walks slightly further into the corridor.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Chloe is so psyched for "girls' night out" so, I better follow her evil plan.

*Max talks to Chloe.*

**Chloe:** Boys or girls?

Boys' locker room.Boys' locker room.**Max:** Boys, of course!

**Chloe:** Figures. Perv.

|-|Girls' locker room.# Girls' locker room.**Max:** Girls, of course!

**Chloe:** Girls? Ooh la-la...

**Chloe:** Let me check to see if the pool's heated...

*Chloe opens the door to one of the changing rooms and walks over to the pool.*

*Optional: Max enters the changing room and rewinds to before Chloe opened the door. She opens the door for Chloe and gestures inside.*

**Max:** Presto!

**Chloe:** Dude, it's getting old! Try and dazzle me with another trick!

*Chloe enters and walks over to the pool.*

**Optional Conversation with Chloe**

**Chloe:** Max, try to find the light for the pool. I want to see the sharks!

**Max:** Otters don't like sharks. They bite.

**Chloe:** So do I... Hit that light!

''Max enters the lifeguard's room and presses the light switch. Chloe takes off her clothes and jumps into the pool. Max approaches the pool and talks to Chloe.''

(Left the money)(Left the money)**Chloe:** Ohh yeah, baby! Feels like a hot tub! Too bad you made me feel like the Queen of Assholes because I wanted that cash stash...

|-|(Stole the money)# (Stole the money)**Chloe:** Oh yeah, baby! Feels like a hot tub! And with my cash stash I'm queen of the world! Bow!

**Chloe:** Tell me you're not going to stand there watching me like a zombie.

*Max smiles. Chloe splashes water on Max.*

**Max:** Don't you dare...

**Chloe:** Come stop me, hippie!

**Max:** Okay, you asked for it!

*Max takes off her clothes and jumps into the pool.*

**Max:** Cowabunga!

**Chloe:** Why look, an otter in my water! Duuuun dun, duuuuun dun, dun dun dun dun dun dun...

**Max:** You're so obvious. And I still get freaked out by that movie, so stop. I can't even watch any of those shark shows.

*Max and Chloe start splashing water on each other.*

**Max:** I'll just rewind and harpoon you. Otter's revenge!

**Chloe:** Cheater!

**Max:** Yeah, you would know about that!

*Chloe lies on her back. Max does the same slightly later.*

**Chloe:** I wish Rachel was here. She would totally love being in here at night. Wish you guys had met each other...

**Max:** We will. With all this stuff going on, I'm starting to think everything is related...

(Saved Kate)(Saved Kate)**Max:** And I want to find out for Kate's sake. She almost died today...
|-|(Couldn't save Kate)# (Couldn't save Kate)**Max:** And I want to find out why for Kate's sake. She didn't deserve to die...

**Chloe:** Your power is changing everything, Max. Especially you. I can already tell. You're not so chickenshit anymore.

*Max and Chloe swim towards the pool border.*

**Max:** Thanks, girlfriend.

**Chloe:** You know what I mean. You're becoming like this force of nature.

**Max:** More like luck of nature. Come on, my power failed trying to rescue Kate... Maybe I'm just stumbling back and forth in time... for what reason?

**Chloe:** You didn't stumble when you saved me, Max.

What if I had?What if I had?
{{#tag:tabber|(Saved Kate)# (Saved Kate)**Max:** Thank God. But... what if I had? What if? Kate didn't jump but you would be... dead...

{{!}}-{{!}}(Couldn't save Kate)(Couldn't save Kate)**Max:** Thank God. But... what if I had? What if? You and Kate would both be dead...

}}

|-|Thanks to you.# Thanks to you.**Max:** Not that time. But that's because you were there to kickstart my power...

**Chloe:** So it's time to start moving forward in time. And we're obviously connected since without me you would have never discovered your power, right?

Absolutely.Absolutely.**Max:** Absolutely. You make me feel like I know what I'm doing...

**Chloe:** And you make me feel like I have a reason for still being in Arcadia Bay.

**Max:** I hope so...

|-|I don't know.# I don't know.**Max:** I don't know...

**Chloe:** Well I do, okay? So just listen to Captain Chloe.

**Max:** I'm trying. As long as we don't waste this power...

**Chloe:** Stop being so goddamn humble. You're like the smartest, most talented person I've ever
