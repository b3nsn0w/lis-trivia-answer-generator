us, but I think we've avoided the worst. I just hope our paths won't cross again anytime soon.* 

*I still don't know why Chloe or even Rachel would want to hang out with Frank, but I can't suss that out anymore. Maybe if I hadn't left town I'd be less judgemental, but I definitely don't see the good in him... Anyhow, we tried, right? And now we have Nathan's phone, David's coordinates, Frank's acccount book, and a big board of clues, which brings us closer to finding Rachel Amber. Finally.* 
|-|Frank Got KilledFrank Got Killed*So now we are responsible for ending Frank's life, even if it was in self-defense, was he meant to die that way? Crumpled up in his own blood on the dirty ground? I don't know how much more death and violence I can take this week... But I know there's something bigger going on than poor Frank or poor me. Maybe a storm that will destroy Arcadia Bay... and what else?*

*I couldn't explain this to Chloe, though. She's devastated about Frank and I can't blame her. But she can't give up now. Chloe is a genuine badass, but she doesn't have the luxury of my powers, so she has to trust me that this is our destiny. Right?*

*And I can't be any kind of hero without my faithful companion... and Chloe has to know that she might play the biggest role in all of this apocalyptic bullshit. And now we have Nathan's phone, David's coordinates, Frank's account book, and a big board of clues, which brings us closer to finding Rachel Amber. Finally.*

*My life feels so surreal at this point, I don't know how to react anymore. I can rewind time and space, but is it aging me before my own time and space? Am I learning things I shouldn't, messing up too much shit... including my own history? Obviously, my nosebleeds and dizzy spells are a bad sign that I'm overusing my powers, but it's become almost part of my nature... or maybe a habit. Power corrupts? Not yet. I hope.*

*I remember this famous episode of the original Star Trek, where Kirk has to go back in time and let the person he loves die, so the Nazis won't win the war... What kind of fucked up choice is that? What would have happened if I had not been in the school bathroom to save Chloe that day?*

*But dammit, I was there and thus I was supposed to be there. DESTINY.*

|-|Frank Got HurtFrank Got Hurt
*So things got a bit out of hand with Frank, but honestly, what else could we expect? He’s not really your everyday hero type, and it was probably stupid of us to hope for a change, but hey, we had to confront him. We tried to persuade him we’re on the same side, but it was a waste of time.*

*We eventually had to defend ourselves and hurt him in the leg, but despite the rage in his eyes he somehow gave us what we were looking for. He was on the verge of unleashing hell on us, but I think we've avoided the worst. I just hope our paths won't cross again anytime soon.*

*I still don't know why Chloe or even Rachel would want to hang out with Frank, but I can't suss that out anymore.

And now we have Nathan's phone, David's coordinates, Frank's account book, and a big board of clues, which brings us closer to finding Rachel Amber. Finally.*
|-|Frank Became An Ally# Frank Became An Ally
*And the fact that we were able to convince Frank to actually help us gives the most hope I've had in a while. Yes, Chloe and I were stupid to confront Frank like that, considering how he reacted before, but I don't see how anyone could say he didn't really love Rachel Amber.*

*He shouldn't have pulled a knife on Chloe though, and I don't like that he sells all these dangerous meds to teenagers, especially Nathan. He needs psychiatric supervision, not just baggies of pills. At least he won't be going to Frank again.*

*I still don't know why Chloe or even Rachel would want to hang out with Frank, but I can't suss that out anymore. Maybe if I hadn't left town I'd be less judgmental... But now we have Nathan's phone, David's coordinates, Frank's account book, and a big board of clues, which brings us closer to finding Rachel Amber. Finally. So maybe the tide is finally turning... or time is finally turning...*

*This is the moment where all the clues come together and we finally have a location outside of town that may lead us straight to Rachel Amber... and beyond.*

*After everything that happened with Frank, I had to convince Chloe to keep going forward with me, since I do feel we're at the end of the road... hopefully not the end of the world. But whatever Chloe has inside her that makes her so
