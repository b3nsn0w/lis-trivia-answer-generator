## **Upper Floor** 
**Optional Conversation with Principal Wells**

''Max touches Wells' shoulder and he turns to face her.''

**Principal Wells:** So, how are you handling your new fame as a photographer?

**Max:** I don't feel like a famous photographer yet.

**Principal Wells:** Every journey starts with the first step. I'm only a Blackwell bureaucrat, not an artist, but you've made us proud with the great response to your work so far.

I'm lucky.I'm lucky.

**Max:** I don't know... I—I'm just lucky. There's no way I'm a real photographer yet.

**Principal Wells:** Don't sell yourself short, Max.

|-|It's surreal.# It's surreal.

**Max:** It's kinda surreal to be here after everything that happened at Blackwell...

**Principal Wells:** All the more reason to celebrate your success.

**Max:** Maybe I feel guilty for celebrating...

**Principal Wells:** Leave that to me. I...I should've been more proactive about Kate Marsh and her awful situation. She's strong, and I'm glad she made it out of that hell. I should've put my foot down with Nathan Prescott...or put my foot in his ass.

Not your fault.Not your fault.

**Max:** It's not your fault. You didn't know what really happened...

**Principal Wells:** I know, but...that's not a good excuse for a principal.

|-|Jefferson fooled us.# Jefferson fooled us.

**Max:** Mark Jefferson was good at hiding his tracks... We were all fooled by him.

**Principal Wells:** Most of all, me. As you might know, I have a weakness for prestige.

|-|I tried to tell you. (reported Nathan)I tried to tell you. (reported Nathan)

**Max:** I did tell you that Nathan was involved...not that I expected anyone to believe me...

**Principal Wells:** I'll regret that for the rest of my life, Max. The Prescotts knew how to protect their own.

|-|I should have told you. (hid the truth)# I should have told you. (hid the truth)

**Max:** I should've told you that Nathan brought a gun to school this week. Maybe things would've been different.

**Principal Wells:** Maybe not. I probably wouldn't have believed that he did. The Prescotts have a way of getting their way...or should I say "had"?

**Principal Wells:** And Jefferson had such a great reputation. Nobody expected him to be so...disturbed. I couldn't believe the police found those sick photos in his dark room. *[sighs]* Those poor girls...

**Max:** At least he's in jail along with Nathan for kidnapping and murder.

**Principal Wells:** And Sean Prescott is now under serious investigation for all his years of corruption. Money and power can only protect you for so long in Arcadia Bay. The irony is that, for once, Sean Prescott actually had no clue what was going on with Jefferson...and he even brought him to Blackwell.

Strange weather.Strange weather.

**Max:** Now if we can just...figure out what's going on with the weather...maybe everything will be like it was before.

**Principal Wells:** Environmental science is above my paygrade, Max. But it sure would be nice to get back to Blackwell Academy the way it was before.

|-|Maybe it's karma.# Maybe it's karma.

**Max:** I—I'd like to think there's some karma involved... The Prescotts have had this coming.

**Principal Wells:** I do believe that what goes around, comes around. I just hope it's all good for a change.

**Max:** I'm hoping this is a fresh start, Principal Wells.

**Principal Wells:** Like I said before, you're an adult now, Max. You can call me Ray now, at least for this event. Now, if you'll excuse me, I hear the buffet calling for me again...

**Conversation Between Man and Woman**

**Man:** I know it's kinda simple, but...I find this haunting.

**Woman:** Right? The instant print makes it look timeless... nostalgic melancholy.

**Man:** Who's the artist?

**Woman:** A teenage girl... I think it's for some contest.

**Man:** That's cool. Seems...pretty mature.

**Optional Conversation with Man**

**Man:** Oh, hey, you're the one who entered the self-portrait! Or, actually, do you call it a "selfie"? Anyway, I was very impressed about how you subverted it to make all of your photo subjects to focus... Huh! Very smart.

**Comment From Woman in Striped Stockings**

**Woman:** Like...I do not understand art.

**Optional Conversation with Man in Striped Shirt**

**Man:** Well, I have to say, this is the best "Everyday Heroes" show I've seen since it began. All the pictures say a lot about our times... Bravo.

**Comments From Woman in Red Jacket**

**Woman:** How much would you pay for that?

**Woman:** I guess everybody is a photographer now...

**Optional Conversation with Woman with Red Socks**

**Woman:** Um, excuse me. I—I just wanted to tell you how much I loved your photograph. I've seen a lot today, but there's something...powerful and understated in yours. I can't wait to see much more of your work in the future.

**Optional Conversation with Journalist**

**Journalist:** Hi, e—excuse me. You're Max Caulfield, right?

**Max:** Um...yeah. Yes...

''He shakes Max's hand.''

**Journalist:** Sorry to bother you, but my name is [Daniel
