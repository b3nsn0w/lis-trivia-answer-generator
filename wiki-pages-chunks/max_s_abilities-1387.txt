Here is a section of the wiki page for Max's Abilities:

## Episode Three - "Chaos Theory"
*Max discovers the ability for the first time. She focuses on a photo of her and Chloe from 2008 and prevents [William Price](william_price.md) from leaving the house and dying in a car crash.

#

## Episode Four - "Dark Room"
*Max focuses on the same photo of her and Chloe again to undo her actions and return to the [Timeline (Life is Strange)](original_timeline.md).

#

## Episode Five - "Polarized" 
*In an effort to escape from the [Dark Room (Location)](dark_room.md), Max focuses on a monochrome photo taken by Jefferson. She manages to kick a trolley, forcing Jefferson to take a different series of photos.
*Max focuses on a different photo of herself and finds her [Max's Journal](diary.md) during the focus.
**She focuses on the selfie taken in Jefferson's class in "Chrysalis", warns [David Madsen](david_madsen.md) about Jefferson and hands in her photo for the [Everyday Heroes Photo Contest](everyday_heroes_photo_contest.md).
*Max uses her winning selfie in the [Zeitgeist Gallery](zeitgeist_gallery.md) to return to the day it was taken and tears it up, preventing herself from winning the contest.
*She focuses on a photo of her and [Warren Graham](warren_graham.md) taken in the [Blackwell Parking Lot](parking_lot.md) to prevent Chloe from going to the [End of the World Party](end_of_the_world_party.md) and subsequently dying.

## Photo Time-Jump Mechanism 
The mechanism involved with the time jumps through pictures involves Max's mind moving back and forth in time while her body doesn't.

## "Autopilot" Max

**Note:** The "autopilot" process brings out some confusing points: After the original 13-year-old Max was possessed by her 18-year-old self, how is she going to remember these few minutes when she hid the car keys when Max jumps her mind back to the body she left in the future?

**Three possibilities:**
* Max won't remember these few minutes and will go on living normally.
* Max knows she was possessed and knows about her future time travel powers. Not likely, as it would affect the timeline too much.
* Her brain will fill in the gaps with fake memories: 13-year-old Max will think she acted from her own will when she hid the keys, maybe thinking it was some kind of prank she doesn't clearly remember.

When a possessed Max warned Chloe on the parking lot, she said to Chloe that she wouldn't remember anything from this time jump ("In a few minutes, I won't know any of this happened... nothing.") Our Max couldn't have any way to know that for sure, but it would imply the first theory is perhaps correct: all autopilot Maxes experience some amnesia and/or blackouts.

Chloe has witnessed Max's blackouts on a few occasions: when she tells Max she "totally blacked out" by the [lighthouse](lighthouse.md) in Episode 1, when Max collapsed and passed out in the [junkyard](junkyard.md) in Episode 2, and when she passed out on the beach to experience a [Max's Nightmare](nightmare.md). However, no time-jumping is believed to be occurring on these occasions as they are only linked to Max experiencing visions and a nightmare. But this raises the question as to whether Max's visions that lead her to points in the future count as time jumping and result in the same side effects.

*Life is Strange* is basically the player following the journey of one iteration of Max's mind through time.

**Side note:** It is interesting to note that the first example of autopilot Max is the only one who doesn't use her Time Manipulation Abilities: this Max never saved Chloe in the bathroom. It confirms Max only discovered or awakened them, by saving Chloe in the bathroom. and also proving that max's Time Manipulation Power isn't genetic but is a part of her Consciousness and or stored inside of her Consciousness.

## Consequences 
Using her power too often causes Max to experience headaches or a physical breakdown, as seen in [Episode 2: Out of Time](episode_2.md) when Chloe forces her to rewind multiple times. When Max uses her photo jump ability, she often gets nose bleeding inside the photo boundaries or afterwards in the new timeline. However, player-triggered rewinds, regardless of how often, do not seem to have any significant impact on her.

## Ethics 
It can be debated whether or not it is ethical that 18 year-old Max jumped into a version of herself in an [Alternative Timeline (Life is Strange)](alternative_timeline.md) where her life was completely different and she was a member of the Vortex Club. Even though the original 18 year-old Max is the one who created this new timeline, is it right for her to interrupt the life of another Max?
It probably bothered Max a lot since, in the nightmare sequence, the Max ghost introduced herself as "one of many Maxes [she] left behind" and told Max she's "left a trail of death (and suffering)" behind her. This could be interpreted as a statement about all of the autopilot Maxes' lives "our" Max interrupted. Whether what the dream Max said is true or not is unknown as it could just be Max's own fear and or theory talking. or just simply it could be instead that since max didn't experience the altered timeline in the past it could be simply that after altering the original timeline her Consciousness is sent back to her body in the present future in the altered timeline however due to her not experiencing the altered events its essentially max without memories of the altered timeline since she did not experience it.
