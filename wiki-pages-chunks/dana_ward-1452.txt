Here is a section of the wiki page for Dana Ward:

## Episode Two - "[Episode 2: Out of Time](out_of_time.md)" 
On Tuesday morning, Max receives an e-mail that Dana sent out to all of her classmates about the upcoming Halloween party, which causes Max to comment on how Dana loves Halloween even more than she does.

As Max makes her way through the dorm to take a shower, she sees [Trevor](trevor.md) not so discreetly leaving Dana’s room, and writing on her slate. Dana is enthusiastically and joyously dancing on her bed, and Max thinks about how she’s never seen Dana so “bouncy and happy without a pot of coffee”.

When Dana sees Max, she quickly tells Max that she’s feeling better than the previous day, and she’s glad they talked. She also comments about how Max seems to be psychic. She then tells Max that Trevor asked her to the Halloween party. She’s happy that she and Trevor are now showing their faces in public, and insists that Max should come with them, as a “cute geek couple with your bitch, Warren”.

After Max expresses some doubt, Dana strongly encourages her to come to the Halloween party. If Max says she’s not going to go, she expresses her disappointment, saying Max came to Blackwell to discover herself. If Max says she will go, Dana compliments her spirit, and says that after the party, Max will be ready for a rave.

When Max arrives for her photography class with Mr. Jefferson, Dana is in [Photography Lab](the_room.md) posing for [Taylor Christensen](taylor_christensen.md), [Hayden Jones](hayden_jones.md), and unknowingly [Daniel DaCosta](daniel_dacosta.md).

When the entire school is standing outside the Girls Dormitory at [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md)’s suicide attempt, Dana and Juliet are holding on to one another, looking very distraught.

## Episode Three - "[Episode 3: Chaos Theory](chaos_theory.md)" 
Later that night, Dana writes several emails expressing that she feels truly sorry and remorseful for not having done more to support Kate and not having been a better friend like Max, and that she's still in shock and mourning or even traumatized by the image of Kate jumping. In a text to Dana, Trevor tries to comfort her and thanks her for always being there for him, and Dana responds that he's as good for her as she is for him. She also receives an email from Juliet requesting some information regarding Kate's incident, but Dana declines her request for the time being, as it's better to keep a low profile at the moment, especially in respect of Kate. She also writes on Max's social media page either thanking her for her heroic saving of Kate or reassuring her for her hard effort despite Kate's death.

As Max is sneaking out of the dorm rooms, Dana will call her into her room. If Kate survived her suicide attempt, Dana will thank Max and ask her why she thinks Kate would try to take her own life.

Regardless of Max's response, Dana will mention to Max that [Victoria Chase](victoria_chase.md) left the dorms earlier that night.

## Episode Four - "[Episode 4: Dark Room](dark_room.md)" 
While Max checks the Dormitory for [Nathan's Room](nathan_s_room.md), she can examine Trevor's room. He and Dana can be heard inside the room, and Max seems disgruntled by their obvious illicit activities there.

Dana later can be found in the VIP section of the [End of the World Party](end_of_the_world_party.md) dancing with Trevor. If Max asks her if she knows where Nathan is, Dana will say that she hasn't seen him that night. Dana adds that she should avoid him "if she wants to have fun" (possibly due to drama), but she knows quite a bit about Nathan and his family suggesting they have hung out before. Dana also invites Max to dance with her and Trevor, an offer Max rejects.

## Episode Five - "[Episode 5: Polarized](polarized.md)" 
She appears in the diner sequence of [Max's Nightmare](max_s_nightmare.md), standing near the entrance to the bathroom Max exits from. She regrets not being able to dance if Max decides not to save her.

Dana can be seen among the attendees at Chloe's funeral in the "Sacrifice Chloe" ending. In the "Sacrifice Arcadia Bay" ending, she is presumed to be among the town's casualties.
