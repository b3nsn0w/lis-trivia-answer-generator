Here is a section of the wiki page for Mark Jefferson:

## Character Creation and Concept 
Jefferson's unique character and significant role as an antagonist brought many dark themes to *Life is Strange* which contributed towards strong development of the story and relationships between other characters. When asked by the fans during the [Square_Enix_Extra_Life_Livestream_(November_2015)](square_enix_livestream.md) of *Life is Strange*, the developers revealed that they pretty much had Mark Jefferson's character set in stone since the beginning. They wanted him to appear as the "cool teacher" and they had a lot of positive feedback from the fans during the earlier episodes saying how much they love Jefferson, but they anticipated the antagonistic hate for him after fans played Episode 4.

As a clear demonstration of his deceptive nature and personality, they noted how Jefferson's true evil colors appeared in the Dark Room during Episode 5. They also revealed in the chat that Rachel Amber was in fact in love with him before her death and that her letter written to Chloe (which can be found in the junkyard during Episode 2) was referencing Mark Jefferson. Mark Jefferson was not suspected by many people as he used his cover as a teacher, therefore creating a "perfect" image.

[Fred Augis](fred_augis.md), the concept artist who designed Mr. Jefferson, explained in an interview that, "Jefferson was supposed to look like a veteran of the art world, but he was also meant to be charming and easy to talk to. We wanted him to look like someone who loves it when people are paying attention to what heâ€™s saying, or looking at his works at an art exhibition."[http://www.momenta.online/2016/08/fred-augis-on-what-makes-a-good-character-design/ Fred Augis on What Makes a Good Character Design] (August 28, 2016)
