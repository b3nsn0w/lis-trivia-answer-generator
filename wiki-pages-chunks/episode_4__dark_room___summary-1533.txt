{{Scaleimage|file# Life-Is-Strange-Episode-4.png|sizelarge}}

**Max realizes that changing the past can lead to painful consequences and that time is not a great healer. Her investigation into the disappearance of Rachel Amber begins to reach a thrilling conclusion as she finds the Dark Room. Will the answers lie within? Or will there just be trouble?**

The now paralyzed and wheelchair-bound [Chloe Price](chloe.md) is taken by [Maxine Caulfield](max.md) to the [Alternative Beach](beach.md) (which is now full of dead whales) where they talk; Chloe reveals that her condition was caused by a car accident and that she had never met [Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md). Max apologizes for not being there for her when she had had her accident. Chloe accepts her apology and is happy to be around her. Later, in [Alternative Price Household](her_house.md), Max helps Chloe with a few favors: fetching her a cup of water, wiping her face, playing a movie, retrieving her morphine injector, and searching for her photo album. Max can also speak to [William Price](william.md) and [Joyce Price](joyce.md) and will learn that they have been taking multiple jobs to pay for Chloe's medical bills and are facing bankruptcy. Afterward, Chloe wants Max to overdose her with morphine so that she can die because her condition is getting worse and she wants to die in her own way.

Max accepts# Max acceptsMax turns the dial on Chloe's morphine drip to its highest setting. Chloe slowly and peacefully nods off for the last time.

Max then focuses on the photo of her and Chloe in the photo album, bringing her back to the day of William's death. Unlike the last time, Max doesn't do anything. William finds his keys as usual and leaves. Max is visibly distraught during the search. Immediately after William leaves, Max burns the photo and tries to comfort Chloe about abandonment. It has no effect and the previous [timeline](timeline.md) is restored.

After the focus, Max finds herself in [Chloe's Room](chloe_s_room.md). She's very happy to have the normal Chloe back (although Chloe is confused by her behavior) and decides not to mention anything of the [Alternative Timeline](altered_timeline.md) to Chloe. It turns out she and Max have made up for Chloe's outburst and are investigating Rachel's disappearance. Max searches [David Madsen](david.md)'s locker for clues (in which she must figure out the combination or break into it using a crowbar). She can also speak to David, who is either working in the garage or getting ready to leave for a hotel. If Max saved the [Blue Jay](blue_jay.md) from [Episode 1: Chrysalis - Summary](episode_1.md), she can find it sitting on a high shelf and Joyce asks Max to get rid of it. She must open the window near the dining table and then shoo it towards the window to get it out of the house.

If [Kate Marsh](kate.md) is still alive, they go to the [hospital](hospital.md) to visit Kate. Chloe remains outside when Max enters the room. Kate and Max have a pleasant discussion. They talk about her recovery, how grateful she was that Max came to the rooftop to help her, the pictures she is drawing for her picture book, and a not so subtle request that Kate's picture book will have photography artwork and that she wants no one other than Max to do it. Later, Max shares that she and Chloe are going to investigate [Nathan Prescott](nathan.md)'s [Nathan's Room](room.md) for clues. Kate will then promise to find out Nathan's room number and to text Max later. Max will then return to Chloe in the hallway. If Max had chosen to answer Kate's call at the [Two Whales Diner](two_whales_diner.md), Chloe will bring it up and apologize failing to see the gravity of the situation and that Chloe can sometimes be very selfish for attention.

Next, they go back to the [Blackwell Academy](blackwell.md) campus to examine Nathan's dorm. Along the way, they have a conversation with [Mark Jefferson](mr__jefferson.md). Max can also speak to [Brooke Scott](brooke.md), [Daniel DaCosta](daniel.md), [Michelle Grant](ms__grant.md), and [Samuel Taylor](samuel.md) while Chloe can be found talking to [Justin Williams](justin.md). After checking that Nathan is gone, Max breaks open his locked door with a fire extinguisher and searches for clues in his room, finding a phone hidden behind his couch. While exiting the boy's dorm, Nathan comes back and threatens Max, but [Warren Graham](warren.md) beats him up. Max can either stop Warren or not do anything. If Max decides not to do anything, Warren beats him up until Nathan lies on the floor, hurt drastically. If this happens, Chloe will take the gun off Nathan but if you decide to stop Warren from beating up Nathan, Nathan will run away with the gun, threatening to tell his [Sean Prescott](father.md).

Max and Chloe decide to visit [Frank Bowers](frank.md) next to get the list of the code names in Frank's book they have found in [Frank's RV](his_rv.md). There are three possible endings:
# Frank (and [Pompidou](pompidou.md) if still alive) are killed by Chloe.
# Frank is wounded by Chloe.
# Frank remains calm during the conversation and becomes an ally.
All three cases end with the pair getting Frank's client list. There are several other bad endings that must be rewound. The bad endings involve losing a gun or knife fight or if Pompidou overwhelms
