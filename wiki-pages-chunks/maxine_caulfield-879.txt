Here is a section of the wiki page for Maxine Caulfield:

## Enemies 
*[Mark Jefferson](mark_jefferson.md) - Max is ambushed and drugged by Jefferson in the junkyard after she and Chloe discover the body of Rachel Amber. Jefferson was heavily involved in the [:Category:Dark Room Conspiracy](dark_room_conspiracy.md) and drugged Max, Victoria and countless other victims, including Kate and Rachel. He has an unhealthy obsession with Max, as shown in the last episode while he has her captured in the Dark Room.
*[Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md) - After seeing Nathan shoot Chloe in the girls' bathroom, and learning of his drugging of both Kate and Chloe, Max is firm enemies with Nathan, particularly if Max reported him for any of his misdeeds. This situation becomes worse after Nathan catches Max and Chloe breaking into his dormitory room and stealing his mobile phone.
*[Raymond Wells](principal_raymond_wells.md) - Max is often dismissed by Wells in favor of the Prescott family; Wells is often nice to other students, causing Max to feel that he dislikes her. He also considers her as nosey, as stated in her Blackwell record. Principal Wells may choose to suspend Max from her studies at Blackwell if Max was not consistent in blaming Nathan for the gun in the bathroom and for Kate's suicide attempt, intervened instead of taking a photo of Kate being hassled by David or had been reported by David earlier for dealing drugs to Chloe.
*[Victoria Chase](victoria_chase.md) (**Determinant**) - Victoria is one of Max's adversaries, as she constantly belittles and makes fun of Max. The distrust between them grows if Max messes up Victoria's photos, or decides to take the photo of her covered in paint instead of comforting her. Max also has the option of whether to warn her about the drugging or to leave her at the party unwarned. Victoria will not believe Max if Max had made fun of her earlier.
*[Taylor Christensen](taylor_christensen.md) (**Determinant**) - As one of Victoria's "minions", Taylor can take her side in issues with Max. However, Max can talk to her on several occasions away from Victoria, and ask her about her ill mother, earning favor with the girl.
*[Courtney Wagner](courtney_wagner.md) (**Determinant**) - As one of Victoria's "minions", Courtney can take her side in issues with Max. However, Max can talk to Courtney about the Vortex Club's dress code, earning favor with her and gaining a spot in the guest list for the Vortex Club party.
*[David Madsen](david_madsen.md) (**Determinant**) - Although David is usually brisk and stern, he and Max can have a varied relationship. He and Max become enemies if she takes the blame for Chloe's weed, got David placed on temporary leave by blaming David for Kate's suicide attempt or by not defending him in front of Joyce about his surveillance addiction.
*[Frank Bowers](frank_bowers.md) (**Determinant**) - After the incident in the junkyard in Episode 2, Max and Frank become enemies as he threatens Chloe. This situation is made worse if Max attempts to shoot Frank or harms Frank's dog. Frank may eventually get shot or stabbed by Chloe if Max fails to persuade Frank to give up his logbook cipher, which can result in his death.
*[Alyssa Anderson](alyssa_anderson.md) (**Determinant**) - The friendship between Max and Alyssa is more and more restrained if Max doesn't or just rarely chooses to warn her since from Alyssa's point of view bad things always happen to her when Max is around. If Max doesn't warn Alyssa during each episode, Alyssa will be very disappointed with Max for not helping her out and Max will be unable to start any conversation with her. If Max does not assist her in every episode, she will be unable to save her from her death in Episode 5.
