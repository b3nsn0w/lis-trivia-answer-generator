Here is a section of the wiki page for Episode 5: Polarized - Summary:

[Dark Room (Location)](dark_room.md). She shouts for help, but nobody hears her. If Max decided not to warn [Victoria Chase](victoria_chase.md) at the [End of the World Party](end_of_the_world_party.md), she will find herself alone, but if she had warned Victoria and Victoria believed her, then Max will notice her unconscious and tied up on the floor next to her.

The only way out for Max is to [Rewind](go_back_in_time.md) through a nearby photograph of her that Jefferson had taken when she was drugged. She manages to free her right leg and pull a nearby trolley contains the photo towards her and focuses on it. She succeeds in traveling back to the point where Jefferson is photographing her. The only problem is that she cannot do much while in this drugged state other than to move and enrage a perfectionist Jefferson while he tries to photograph her. He walks off to get a stronger dose to keep her still. As he returns to dose her, Max struggles, which results in her kicking away the nearby trolley and soaking Jefferson's photos with the drugs. This further enrages Jefferson before he proceeds to dose Max, making her fall unconscious. As a result of this, a minor change is made to the timeline due to Max ruining Jefferson's photos. Max ends up where she was before: in the Dark Room with her hands and feet still tied to the chair.

Max notices a new set of photos on the trolley now and spies one where she appears to be more alert. If Victoria is with her, she will regain conscious and Max will have the opportunity to talk to her. She uses the photo to go back in time to that moment. In this more alert state, she is able to listen to Jefferson as he reveals his scheme: he is obsessed with capturing the innocence of young women and hopes to see that their innocence evolves into corruption. He also discloses that [Nathan Prescott](nathan_nbsp_prescott.md) is dead and will be the perfect scapegoat for Jefferson to get away with his evil deeds and reveals that the [Prescott Family](prescott_family.md) (who have unknowingly been helping Jefferson with his schemes) will face consequences if Nathan's actions ever got out to public. The conversation will also vary depending on whether Max saved [Kate Marsh](kate.md) or not, who she blamed for Kate's attempted suicide, and if she allowed Warren to beat up Nathan or stopped him. Max notices her diary and mentions it to Jefferson who picks it up and throws it on the floor in front of her, making a disparaging comment about the photo on the page it lands open at, which happens to be the selfie she took in Jefferson's class earlier in the week ([Episode 1: Chrysalis](episode_1__chrysalis.md)): *"What a waste of talent... Look at that shot, Max... You can do so much better..."* While Jefferson walks away to study his new photo set, Max uses this moment to go back in time through her class selfie.

As soon as she is back in Jefferson's class at the start of the week, Max finds [David Madsen](david_madsen.md)'s phone number in a brochure and texts David, praying that he will overreact to it and track Jefferson and his Dark Room down as soon as possible. Jefferson will then ask Max the same question he asked her in Episode 1, in which she can simply answer it or just be passive towards him. After talking to Kate, Max then walks to the front of the class where Jefferson and Victoria are talking and after speaking to Victoria, hands in her photo entry for the [Everyday Heroes Photo Contest](everyday_heroes_contest.md). The timeline changes again with various events involving Jefferson, Nathan, and Kate's attempted suicide being changed: police officers invading the Dark Room, Jefferson and Nathan being arrested, police officers finding Rachel's body, Max winning the Everyday Heroes Contest and later leaving to [San Francisco](san_francisco.md). Max wakes up on a [Plane](plane.md) that is on its way to San Francisco. [Raymond Wells](principal_wells.md) is sitting next to her, asleep. Looking at her phone, she discovers messages from her [Vanessa Caulfield](mom.md), her [Ryan Caulfield](dad.md), [Chloe Price](chloe_price.md), [Dana Ward](dana_ward.md), [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md), and [Warren Graham](warren_graham.md), all congratulating her on winning the contest. A nearby newspaper reveals that Jefferson and Nathan were arrested for their crimes and [Sean Prescott](sean_prescott.md) is now under investigation for owning the [Prescott Barn](barn.md) where Jefferson was performing his illegal activities and thus, leading to the Prescott family's downfall. It's October 11th, and it seems like Arcadia Bay is finally safe! Max is relieved. One last change is then made to the timeline, which shows Max and Principal Wells exiting the airport. Once she arrives at the [Zeitgeist Gallery](zeitgeist_gallery.md), Principal Wells advises her to make the most of this opportunity and mingle with the attendees who seem to adore her entry. She can also speak to Wells and various people. As she stands in front of her entry, she gets a sudden headache and a vision of the storm with Chloe's voice desperately shouting her name. Max comes to with a nosebleed, and tells the concerned crowd, *"Iâ€™m okay... Jet lag... High altitude..."*, before rushing downstairs to find a quiet place to check her phone. She curses herself for leaving the ringer off and sees 6 missed calls, all from Chloe. Max immediately rings her back and hears Chloe's panicked voice telling her that her vision was true and that the tornado is heading straight for the town. Max knows exactly what she has to do and heads back upstairs to travel back in time through her competition entry. She finds herself back in her
