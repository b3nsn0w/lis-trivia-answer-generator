## **Conversation with Victoria** 
**Victoria:** Oh, look, it's Max Caulfield, the selfie ho of Blackwell. What a lame gimmick. Even Mark—Mr. Jefferson—falls for your waif hipster bullshit. "The Daguerreian Process, sir!" You could barely even say that. I guess you got your meds filled. *(Taylor and Courtney laugh)* Since you know all the answers, I guess you have to find another way into the dorm. We ain't moving. Oh, wait, hold that pose! *(takes a photo of Max with her phone)* So original. Don't worry, Max, I'll put a vintage filter on it right before I post it all over social medias. Now, why don't you go fuck your selfie?

**Max:** *(thinking)* Oh, yes, Victoria, I'll get your bony ass out of my way.

''Max watches Samuel hang a paint bucket on scaffolding. Max rewinds and tampers with Samuel's bucket.*

**Max:** *(thinking)'' Okay, let's see if this works.

*She then changes the pressure of the sprinklers. Victoria, Taylor and Courtney are sprayed by water and get up from the steps.*

**Victoria:** What the hell? Are you kidding? Look at this...

**Taylor:** Chill, Victoria. It's just water—

**Victoria:** Yeah, water on my cashmere! Do you know how much this fucking outfit cost?

**Taylor:** You look...great.

**Victoria:** I can't even chill on the steps...

*The bucket falls on the ground and paint splashes onto Victoria.*

**Victoria:** No way! No fucking way!

**Courtney:** You okay, Victoria?

**Samuel:** Ol' Samuel is sorry. Wet paint is not good for hair, nope. Sorry—

**Victoria:** Get the hell away from me, weirdo!

**Courtney:** Hold on, hold on, we'll get some towels... We'll be right back!

**Victoria:** So move your ass, before I dry!

**Max:** *(thinking)* It worked! Don't mess with Max, bitches.

*Max approaches Victoria.*

**Max: **Uh...hey, Victoria...

**Victoria:** What do you want, Max?

**Victoria:** Don't...don't say a word, Max.

**Max:** Oh, wait, hold that pose! *(takes photo of Victoria with her instant camera)* And no filter needed before I post this. Now please move. I've had a messed up day and I'm going to my room.

**Victoria:** You do that... I know where you live... So does Nathan...

**Max:** *(thinking)* Maybe I shouldn't have done that... Now I have to get to my room, then see Warren.

**Max:** I am sorry. That's an awesome cashmere coat...

**Victoria:** It was. But there will be another.

**Max:** Well, you always seem to know how to pick the right outfits.

**Victoria:** I do have some talent. Mr. Jefferson told me—

**Max:** I've seen your pictures. You have a great eye, Richard Avedon-esque.

**Victoria:** He's one of my heroes... Thanks, Max. I hope those sluts get me a towel before they hang a sign on me. You deserve a better shot. Sorry about blocking you and...and the "go fuck your selfie".

**Max:** That was mean...but pretty funny.

**Victoria:** Just one of those days, you know?

**Max:** I know exactly what you mean, Victoria. I'll see you later.

**Victoria:** *Au revoir*.

**Max:** *(thinking)* Victoria probably played me. I should have played her... Better get to my room before I find Warren.

## **Optional Conversation with [Alyssa Anderson](alyssa_anderson.md)** # 
**Alyssa:** Oh, hi, Max.

How are you?How are you?

**Max:** How are you doing?

**Alyssa:** Fantastic. I'm by myself reading chick-lit. Pretty soon I'll be bonding with Victoria at the Vortex Club...

**Max:** I think you're better off reading chick-lit.

|-|What are you reading?# What are you reading?

**Max:** What are you reading?

**Alyssa:** *Love Today Or Die Forever*... Don't even say anything.

**Max:** It's a best-seller. What to say?

**Alyssa:** Good point. Now, if you'll excuse me...

## **Optional Conversation with Kate** # 
**Max:** Hi, Kate.

**Kate:** Hey, Max...

How was class?How was class?

**Max:** How did you like class today?

**Kate:** I don't remember... I guess I don't care about much of anything today.

|-|You look down.# You look down.

**Max:** You look down. You okay?

**Kate:** I'm kind of over humanity today... Sorry to be a drama queen.

**Max:** Is there anything...?

**Kate:** Max, I'd like to be alone, if you don't mind. I'm sorry...
