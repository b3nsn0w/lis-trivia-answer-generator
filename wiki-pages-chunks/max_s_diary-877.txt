## Inconsistencies 
{{Main|Inconsistencies (Life is Strange)}}

* On the [Max's Character Notes#Warren](character_note.md) for Warren in Max's diary, she mentions that he is "her age," but this contradicts his age on his student record, since they are aged two years apart. It is possible that Max didn't know Warren's age at the time she wrote that in her diary, since she had only recently arrived at Blackwell.
* Despite the fact that Max mentions Nathan is **19** in her [Max's Character Notes#Nathan](character_note.md) about him, his school file states that he was born on August 29, 1995, making him **18** years old. This could be explained by Max being misinformed, as she did not know Nathan well and was perhaps unlikely to know his birthday.
* Max's [Max's Character Notes#Kate](character_notes_for_kate_marsh.md)Â will change in this episode, depending on whether Max manages to save her life or not. A new decal will appear on the page to cover the 'LiFE' graphic that was visible in the previous two episodes. However, there is currently an inconsistency with how these new graphics appear, due to the files being misnamed in the Unreal Engine packages.(*TX_Character_E3_Kate_SF, TX_Character_E4_Kate_SF, and TX_Character_E5_Kate_SF*). The sticker graphic that implies Kate is alive has been labelled *Kate_scrapbook_dead*, and the sticker graphic that implies that Kate is dead has been labelled *Kate_scrapbook_alive*. If Kate dies, the sticker graphic that appears after this consequence implies she is still alive ("*Get Well Soon*"). If Kate lives, the sticker graphic that appears implies that she has died ("*Love is how you stay alive, even after you are gone*").DONTNOD were made aware of this inconsistency on 29th March 2017. It is unknown if a patch will be released that fixes this issue.
* A drawing on page 11 of Max's diary shows Max executing her [rewind](rewind.md) gesture with her left hand raised, but she raises her right hand in the game. This sketch is inconsistent with gameplay but appears to have been based on early concept art that features as the box art for the game.
* Max has drawn Chloe with a red hoop earring on page 17 of her diary even though Chloe has no earring in the game. On the next page, Max does refer to Chloe having piercings (plural), but there are no visible ones at this early point in the game. (We later see in Episode 3 that Chloe has a belly button piercing but still no ear piercings or earrings in general.) Even though Max's sketch could be put down to an idealized version of Chloe from Max's imagination, the sketch is a replication of early concept art. As for the journal entry about piercings, this could have been an early writing remnant that the concept art was based on, or vice versa.
* On Page 22 of Max's diary, she writes about Chloe: "It's so strange where our lives have gone since the last time we hung out when we were **thirteen**." With their birth dates (Chloe - March 1994; Max - September 1995), there is no way that they would have been aged 13 at the same time. Chloe would have turned **14** six months before Max turned 13. A possible explanation for this could be that Max is simply generalizing their ages, using the age that she remembers herself being. Another example of when she does this is in Episode 4 when she sees the pirate CD in Chloe's room: *"Oh my God, I made that mix for her when we were twelve."*
*On page 39 of Max's diary for October 9, 2013, an extract of a personal organizer for March 2014 can be seen (although the month and year is partially obscured and not something that is immediately obvious). A plausible explanation could simply be that Max had a calendar for the full 2013-2014 academic school year.
