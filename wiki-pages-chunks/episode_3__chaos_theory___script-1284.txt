## *'Chloe's Truck** 

**Max:''' Chloe, you can't keep blaming me and everybody for everything wrong in your life. It's so not fair.

**Chloe:** I gotta blame somebody. Otherwise it's all my fault. Fuck that.

Grow up.# Grow up.

{{#tag:tabber|(Kate is alive)(Kate is alive)

**Max:** Grow up! God, you're not the only one in Arcadia Bay with problems! Kate Marsh almost...

**Chloe:** Yes, Kate Marsh ALMOST killed herself. Such sad, okay?! That doesn't make me feel any better about my fucked-up life, get it?

{{!}}-{{!}}(Kate is dead)# (Kate is dead)

**Max:** Grow up. And I'm not trying to be mean. But you're not the only one in Arcadia Bay with problems. Kate Marsh killed herself, you know?

**Chloe:** Yes, Kate Marsh killed herself. She's dead. Such sad. Okay? That doesn't make me feel any better about my fucked-up life, get it?

}}

|-|Nobody's fault.Nobody's fault.

**Max:** It's just life, shit happens, it's nobody's fault, "blah, blah, blah", as Mr. Jefferson would say.

{{#tag:tabber|(Kate is alive)# (Kate is alive)

**Max:** And Kate Marsh...

**Chloe:** Yes, Kate Marsh ALMOST killed herself. Such sad, okay?! That doesn't make me feel any better about my fucked-up life, get it?

{{!}}-{{!}}(Kate is dead)(Kate is dead)

**Max:** And Kate Marsh...

**Chloe:** Yes, Kate Marsh killed herself. She's dead. Such sad. Okay? That doesn't make me feel any better about my fucked-up life, get it?

}}

|-|Rachel and Frank.# Rachel and Frank.

**Max:** So now it's Rachel's fault, too?

**Chloe:** Jesus, she was banging that pig Frank! Bitch LIED to my FACE, Max! I can't trust anybody again. Everybody pretends to care until they don't. Even you.

**Max:** Chloe Price, you better take that back. Right now.

**Chloe:** Okay, fine... But you just don't understand. It's like I'm being punished by the universe...

**Max:** So who do you most want to blame?

**Chloe:** My fucking dad of course... hello!?

William?William?

**Max:** You blame William? Really?

**Chloe:** Yes, I do. Damn right. He CHOSE to go out that door and leave me forever.

|-|David?# David?

**Max:** You blame David?

**Chloe:** I said "my dad"! My real father, who got himself killed for nothing! Not that human placeholder for Joyce.

**Max:** Chloe, your dad didn't "choose" to...leave you.

**Chloe:** I know that, Max! My mom actually blames herself...just because she wanted a ride home from work. Sometimes...even I blame her.

**Max:** No, you don't.

**Chloe:** Yes, Max, I do. Do you know what it's like to wait for your father to come home when you're a kid...and he never does?

**Max:** No, of course not. But I was with you that day, it was just a terrible accident!

**Chloe:** I wish that made me feel better. But ever since he died, my life has been dipped in shit.

You're still here.You're still here.

**Max:** You don't want to hear this, but you're still here. Alive. With me. And that is no accident.

**Chloe:** You're right. I don't wanna hear this.

|-|I can tell.# I can tell.

**Max:** I can tell... But look at everything that's happened the past week. Your life has changed mine and that's not shit.

**Chloe:** *(emotionally)* I'd really love to believe that... I'd like to believe in something after what's happened...

**Max:** Chloe, I can't do this out on my own. I NEED you with me. And Rachel needs you...

*Chloe drives up to the entrance of Blackwell. She stays quiet and looks away as Max gets out of the car. Max walks up the stairs to the campus and Chloe drives away.*

## '''Max's Room'* 

*Max sits on the bed in her room, staring sadly at a photo of herself and Chloe when they were young. She begins to hear faint voices coming from the photo, and the picture starts to shift and change.*

**Young Chloe:** *[laughs]* Get a close-up of Max!

**Young Max:** Knock it off, Chloe!

*Max, startled, drops the photo on the floor.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Oh, my god. What is happening now?

*Max slowly leans down and picks up the photo. It begins to change and voices emanate from it again.*

**William:** Yes, girls. Time for a picture.

**Young Chloe:** Cheesecake!

**William:** Come on now, say "pancake"!

**Young Max:** *[laughs]'' I can't even see!

*Max focuses on the photo.*
