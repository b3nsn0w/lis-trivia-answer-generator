Here is a section of the wiki page for Nathan Prescott:

## Episode Three - "[Episode 3: Chaos Theory](chaos_theory.md)" 
When Max leaves her dorm room later that evening, she has the chance to search Victoria's room where she finds several photos depicting Nathan and Victoria confirming their close relationship.

If Nathan got suspended following the meeting that took place in Principal Wells' office, he will send an email to Victoria in which he completely vents anger at Max over his suspension as a result of her accusations over his involvement in drugging Kate. Also in the email, Nathan makes a disgruntled comment about his parents threatening him with a job in his father's office, which he claims they are "dumb" for wanting him to represent. Victoria emails back, also venting about Max and telling Nathan that she will talk to him later via text.

While Max and Chloe search Principal Wells' office for clues, they discover e-mails from Nathan's father to the Blackwell principal, threatening to cut off funding if his son is not treated appropriately with a spotless record. They also discover several creepy drawings from Nathan, proclaiming "Rachel in the Dark Room" hinting to him being connected to her disappearance.

Other files reveal that Nathan and David Madsen had accused [Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md) of drug dealing prior to her disappearance, and Nathan had behaved inappropriately at school for months. An Incident Report wrote that he had several crude outbursts, including throwing a desk in class, cursing at his English teacher [Bernadette Hoida](bernadette_hoida.md), lighting firecrackers in the bathroom, stealing school supplies, threatening the school custodian, [Samuel Taylor](samuel_taylor.md), and the attempted theft of the school's [Tobanga](tobanga.md) Totem. A self-written file by Nathan says, "David M. always asks what's going on in my head. David always helps me follow those he follows", implicating a deeper involvement with both of them.

Max can also look through Nathan's gym locker after breaking into the [Blackwell Swimming Pool](blackwell_swimming_pool.md), and will find the prescription drugs Diazepam and Risperidone.[http://www.drugs.com/diazepam.html Diazepam], [http://www.drugs.com/risperidone.html Risperidone]. These drugs, as mentioned before, are used to treat anxiety, alcohol withdrawal, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

The next morning, Nathan will be in the [Two Whales Diner](two_whales_diner.md) sitting alone with a camera. When Max approaches him in Rachel Amber's old clothes (provided by Chloe earlier), he initially mistakes her as Rachel by exclaiming Rachel's name in excitement as he looks up at Max, implying that he and Rachel were friendly. However, the conversation soon turns aggressive on Nathan's side, the intensity of which depends on Max's previous decisions.

If asked about where to get drugs, Nathan will tell Max to go and ask Frank for "higher education", implying that this is some kind of code phrase to hook her up. If asked about his father, he will dismiss Max, calling his father "an asshole".[https://youtu.be/WHIexL9caus?t# 2h2m29s YouTube video] showcasing the conversation shared between Max and Nathan about Nathan's father. If asked about Rachel and Frank, he will say that she partied more than him and she was a "fiend on her own". He accidentally lets it slip that Frank made a "blood oath" with Rachel but tells her not let anyone know he said anything. If Max rewinds, she can use the information about the blood oath against Nathan, throwing him off-guard. Panicked, Nathan reveals that Frank believed Rachel was in love with him, when Nathan believed all she wanted was his drugs and used Frank, allowing him to take pictures of her to facilitate her drug habit. Nathan claims that even Rachel thought Frank was a liar and loser, like most people in Arcadia Bay apparently thought. If asked about Kate, he will say that Max has no idea what is going on.
