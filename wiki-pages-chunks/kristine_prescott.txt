To: Nathan Prescott

From: Kristine Prescott

Tudo bem from Brazil, Little Brother! It's been too long since I've heard from you so please let me know what's going on in your exciting scholastic life at Blackwell. I brag to all my co-workers in the Peace Corps that my talented brother Nate got a full scholarship to one of the best art schools in the world. Even though I can't always check my mail or phone, pleasepleaseplease send me some new photos of campus so I can live vicariously through your lens. I miss you and your pictures.

And yes, mother told me that you've been in trouble and father has been on your ass, but you have to either ignore him or stand up to him. You know I love Dad, Nate, but I am also in a jungle halfway across the world because of him. He's a bully who inherited power not wisdom and the only way to win against one is to fight back. Don't let him change you into one just for the family "legacy." End of lecture. You're at school, so I just wanted to make you feel at home:]

Back to the mangrove. Sending out good thoughts. Better write back or I'll have a jaguar shipped to your dorm!

xoxoxo

Kris
