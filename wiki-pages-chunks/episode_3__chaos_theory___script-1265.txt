## '''Frank's RV** 

**Chloe:** Damn, and I thought my room was a shithole.

**Max:''' You're not a creepy drug dealer.

**Chloe:** Frank has issues, but he's not creepy... At least I didn't think so until I saw him with Rachel's bracelet.

''Chloe sits in the driver's seat.''

**Chloe:** Oh, we could cruise everywhere in this bad boy. Can you see us heading down the coast to Big Sur and beyond?

**Max:** Yes, we'd be tearing up the highway.

(Kissed Chloe)(Kissed Chloe)
**Max:** And you'd probably want me to kiss you again...

|-|(Didn't kiss Chloe)# (Didn't kiss Chloe)
**Max:** And you'd dare me to drive it like you dared me to kiss you...

**Max:** Chloe, we're on a schedule. We need clues about Rachel.

**Chloe:** I know. Just daydreaming.

**Chloe:** You scope the area while I hack his computer for info.

**Max:** *(thinking)* Frank is almost a made-for-TV hoarder. This place is nasty.

'''Chloe and Max's comments**

**Chloe:** Crappy wi-fi out here. Must take him days to download porn.

**Max:** Yuck.

**Chloe:** Whoa, what the hell is he doing with that dog...

**Max:** Stop it.

**Chloe:** I cannot believe he would wear a collar and a furry mask...

**Max:''' You're dumb!

**Chloe:** Max, you didn't tell me you took photos of Frank in action...

**Max:** I'm seriously ignoring you.

''Max opens a cabinet near the front of the RV and sees Chloe's gun.*

**Max:** *(thinking)'' Presto, Chloe's gun. Should I give it back to her?

{{#tag:tabber|LEAVE THE GUN# LEAVE THE GUN

*Max closes the cabinet.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* I might regret this, but I can't let Chloe hurt someone...or get hurt.

{{!}}-{{!}}GIVE THE GUN TO CHLOEGIVE THE GUN TO CHLOE
*Max takes the gun and walks over to Chloe.*

**Max:** I have a terrible present for you...

**Chloe:** An ounce of dank bud?

*Max gives Chloe the gun.*

**Chloe:** Oh you so rule, Max. Thank you. I feel so much better now.

**Max:** You better bring it back to David right away.

**Chloe:** Yeah, sure, I'm on it.

**Max:** *(thinking)* I might regret this, but I can't let Frank hurt someone...

''Max goes into Frank's bedroom. She tries to open the vent next to the door.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Okay, this vent is loose. I need something to pry it open...

*Max walks back into the kitchen and takes the knife from the counter.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* This is almost as good as a set of keys.

*Max uses the knife to pry open the vent.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* My blade will open any portal!

*She removes Frank's Account Book from the vent.*

**Picture 1**

**Max:** *(thinking)'' Oh man, Rachel and Frank's dog...

**Letter 1**

**Max:** *(thinking)* I don't know if I should be touched or disturbed...

**Picture 2**

**Max:** *(thinking)* I'm glad Rachel got to drive this beast. She looks genuinely happy.

**Picture 3**

**Max:** *(thinking)* Rachel really did hang out with Frank.

**Picture 4**

**Max:** *(thinking)* I'm learning more about Rachel than I want to know...

**Letter 2**

**Max:** *(thinking)* Hmm, trouble in paradise.

*Max shows the Account Book to Chloe.*

**Chloe:** It makes me ill that Rachel posed like this for Frank... or wrote him love letters... I can't believe she was banging Frank! Rachel straight up lied to my face! Why didn't she say anything?

**Max:** Because she knew how you would react.

**Chloe:** Then she wasn't much of a friend, huh? Just another person who shits all over me. Why does everybody in my life let me down? My dad gets killed, you bail on me for years, my mother gloms onto step-fucker... now Rachel betrays me...

**Max:** Chloe, Rachel is missing. Nobody betrayed you.

(Sided with Chloe)# (Sided with Chloe)
**Chloe:** Bullshit, who hasn't?! Fuck everybody!

|-|(Sided with David)(Sided with David)
**Chloe:** Bullshit. You totally defended step-stalker! Fuck everybody!

**Max:** Chloe!

''Chloe leaves the RV and throws Frank's keys onto the roof of the diner. Frank watches from the window as Chloe and Max drive away, and then continues to eat his beans.*
