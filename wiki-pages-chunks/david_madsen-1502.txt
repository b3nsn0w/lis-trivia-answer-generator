Here is a section of the wiki page for David Madsen:

## Family 
* [Joyce Price](joyce_price.md) - David met Joyce when he was a customer in her diner where she left a note on his receipt thanking him for acting like a gentleman. Unlike most people, Joyce showed concern for his emotional struggles after his war experience, and David felt truly understood by her, which gave him the hope and support he needed to move on and start a new life. Despite David's problematic relationship with her daughter, they have been living a happy marriage. David is shown to truly care for Joyce, even respecting her wish to keep mementos of her deceased husband William in their room, and Joyce tells Max on several occasions that David is a good man who is simply misunderstood by those who do not know him well. He treasures their family over everything, and after the argument in Episode 3 breaks out, he shows his genuine efforts by promising Joyce to go see a family counselor and to apologize to Chloe. During Chloe's funeral in the sacrifice Chloe ending, despite David's own sorrow at having lost Chloe, he had to lead and hold Joyce and was supporting and comforting her throughout as Joyce was visibly emotional and distraught.
* [Chloe Price](chloe_price.md) - David and Chloe have a fragmented and antagonistic relationship. Chloe clearly disrespects him and has a number of unfavorable nicknames for him including "step-douche" and "step-dick". David has been shown to be physically and verbally abusive towards Chloe, such as slapping her and calling her a loser if Max does not take the blame for Chloe's marijuana. If Max finds out that David has been keeping video surveillance on Chloe's house and tells Joyce, Chloe will be visibly happy that Joyce tells David that he needs to find a room at a hotel. However, David seems to want a loving relationship with Chloe despite her criminal activities and bad attitude; a birthday card from him to her suggests that he is proud to be a step-father and wants the same as Joyce; to be a family. Though he may not be able to show it properly, he truly is concerned about Chloe's well-being, may it refer to her scholastic career, the company she keeps, or her drug abuse. In the last episode, he admits to Max that the family he has with Chloe and her mother is everything that matters to him and that he always tried to be a good father, but he also realizes that he failed by being too obsessed. He shows his genuine interest in Chloe by promising Joyce to go see a family counselor and apologize to Chloe after the argument that broke out between them in episode three. Also, he is obviously deeply hurt after finding out that Chloe was killed by Jefferson, regretting that he wasn't able to protect her like he promised Joyce and that he was never able to properly tell her that he loved her, which even causes him to shoot Jefferson in an act of revenge.Â If Max hides the truth about Chloe by telling him she went medicating before she ended up in the Dark Room, he may even be reassured for the first time in his life that Chloe is a stoner.

## Enemies 
* [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) (**Determinant**) - David doesn't trust Max since their first confrontation at Blackwell Academy. If Max decides to defend Kate and takes the blame for Chloe in her room, David will say he doesn't want to see Max anymore. In Principal Wells' office, Max has the option to blame David for bullying Kate, to which he tells her to "grow up". Their relationship worsens if Max decides to side with Chloe during the argument in the living room. In that case, David will say once again that he doesn't want to see or hear from Max. The following morning, David is angry with Max for breaking up his family. Max is also one of David's suspects because her photos are present in his files. However, it is likely that he was just worried that Max would become another potential victim, just as Rachel and Kate were due to the behavior he had observed of her as his role as a security officer. Regardless of Max's choices, David will still rescue Max from the Dark Room in "Polarized" and will apologize for his earlier actions, so it can be said that their relationship shifts from enemies to friends throughout the events of the game.
* [Mark Jefferson](mark_jefferson.md) - David thinks he's an "elitist prick" who isn't trustworthy, and David later reveals that he always suspected him. David may get knocked out by Mark Jefferson, end up with a scar on his forehead or get shot dead while fighting Mark Jefferson in the Dark Room bunker in the last episode. If Max decides to tell the truth about Mark Jefferson having killed Chloe, David will shoot Mark in an act of revenge. In other alternative timelines, David who is better prepared with a gun and body armor would confront Mark Jefferson together with several Arcadia Bay police officers, and Jefferson will surrender without a fight.
* [Michelle Grant](michelle_grant.md) - Ms. Grant sabotages David's plans for installing a surveillance system at Blackwell with her petition. However, she will also defend David if he is placed on temporary leave and an unknown number of Blackwell students start an online petition to have David dismissed from his job as Blackwell head of security.
* [Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md) - David was tracking Nathan in his investigation, close to directly linking him with Jefferson and the disappearances. Using the evidence Madsen had already collected, Max was able to easily piece together the clues. Nathan Prescott had attempted to drug Chloe and took a picture of her. Max sees this when she search his room in his drawer. During the investigation sequence, it is apparent that Nathan was also angry at Frank, thinking he gave him water in the text evidence Max finds. Instead, it is likely the dose was too low, as he was inexperienced with using the drugs, which is further proven by him overdosing Rachel with the gamma hydroxide acid provided to him from Frank, and that Chloe was willing and able to fight back because he didn't have Jefferson with him or his help. This directly makes Nathan Prescott a main enemy of David. He had tried to experiment outside of Jefferson's Dark Room on Chloe and was angry at Frank that she managed to fight back. David made a promise to protect Chloe. Fortunately, Nathan's attempt was botched by his inexperience, or he would have neutralized him.
