really want to take money from the handicapped fund? I know you need to pay Frank back, but... I've got my power to protect you, right?

**Chloe:** There's a lot of power in that horse-choking wad of cash... *[puts the money back in]* but yes, Moral Max is right again. I guess... *[gets up from the chair and turns off the lamp]* Let's get the hell out of this office morgue.

''Chloe leaves the principal's office.*

**Max:** *(thinking)'' I know that money would have helped Chloe and me...

|-|STEAL THE MONEY# STEAL THE MONEY**Max:** Frank knows things about Rachel and he might talk if he's been paid... Right?

**Chloe:** You are SuperMax.

*Chloe gets up from the chair and hugs Max.*

**Chloe:** And with the leftover dough, I'll take you on a road trip to Portland for the day. We'll stock up on tats, beer, weed, and donuts.

**Chloe:** And strip clubs... Kidding! But you never know...

*Chloe turns off the lamp and leaves the office.*

''Max leaves the principal's office. Chloe is waiting for her near the door.''

**Max:** That impish look scares me.

**Chloe:** Care for a midnight swim? The Blackwell pool is ours.

**Max:** Swimming? You want to take that risk now?

(Left the money)(Left the money)**Chloe:** It's been a cray week. You didn't let me take that money to pay off Frank, so if he pops a cap in my skull at least allow me to have a little carefree fun for a few minutes... Splish splash?

|-|(Stole the money)# (Stole the money)**Chloe:** It's been a cray week, we deserve a little mindless fun in the water... We're done for the night anyway, we're rich, and nobody busted us. So, splish splash?

**Max:** You're right. We hella deserve it. Splish splash!

**Chloe:** Did you actually just say "hella"? I think I'm a good bad influence on you.
