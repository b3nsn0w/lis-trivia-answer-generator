Here is a section of the wiki page for Zeitgeist Gallery:

## Upper-Floor Exhibit Room 
The upper-floor exhibit room is accessed by walking up the small flights of stairs on both sides of the ground floor. Other entries of the Everyday Heroes Contest are displayed here. Clusters of smaller photos are all square with two per column and three columns at most. This section of the gallery overlooks the ground floor. The buffet tables are on this floor on either side, and [Raymond Wells](principal_wells.md) gladly takes part in eating the caviar so Max doesn't have to. The windows from the lower floor exhibit room ceiling peek into this room.

*The first cluster of photos near the left staircase include a dog and baby cuddling as a large portrait-style image, and the cluster of smaller photos have two columns. They are a child and parent walking on a beach, a teacher with a book presumably reading to a class, two lab workers doing blood work, and a bald hospital patient.
*The second cluster of photos (if the player continues to go straight) on the same wall is two landscape-style photos with one of a well-dressed person offering a helping hand or perhaps money to someone sitting condensed on the ground. The second one is of a nurse practitioner in a hospital room with a stethoscope around their neck.
*The third cluster of photos is three columns of small square photos. The first column has a firefighter in a mask holding a cat and a pug that has no hind legs sleeping. The second column is a black astronaut and below it is a service dog with a person in a wheelchair. The third column has a colorful  or gathering and a police officer and dog. This is the last cluster of photos on this wall.
*The first cluster of photos on the right-hand side are both landscape and are of a hiker pictured on the very top of a mountain and a monochromatic photo of a person holding a camera to their eye.
*The next cluster of photos is only one photo. It is a square monochromatic picture of two [http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term# wlw WLW] kissing. This is the last photo on the wall before another wall sticks out, but the wall does continue.
*On the other side of the wall facing the previous image, a landscape picture of a waitstaff member is carrying a very large tray of food and drinks. Judging by what is on the tray, they may work at a cafe or somewhere of the likes that serves many pastries and hot drinks. They are in a formal uniform with one of their sleeves rolled up and a cute little hat.
*The continuation of the wall the previous one sticks out from has one portrait photo and two columns of small photos. The landscape photo is of a police officer with a riot shield and face shield. The first column of small photos has a child and a dog running on a hill away from the direction of the forest and a person in red walking on a beach. The second column of small photos has two service people walking away from the camera in turtle shell helmets and the second one is of a well-dressed person offering another person that is bundled up something that looks somewhat like food, but the photo is so low-res it's hard to tell. This is the last photo on this wall and is in a corner with another cluster of photos.
*The next cluster of photos that shares a corner with the previous one has two portrait-style photos of people in uniform. The first is of two in marine uniforms holding a gun to their chests and the second is of three people in a line in cadet uniforms.
*To the left of this is a cluster of two square photos, featuring Max's entry to the contest. The one next to hers is of a parent and child holding hands and walking through a dirty-looking alleyway. Max's entry is of herself facing her wall of photos in her [Max's Room](dorm_room.md), taken from behind.
*The cluster of photos next to this is the final one on the wall and it shares a corner with the third cluster of photos on the wall adjacent to the left stairwell. It features one landscape and one portrait photo. The landscape photo is of a parent giving their child a piggy-back ride. The second is of a parent nursing a newborn baby.
*In the upper left corner of the room there is a wall in the middle of the floor with photos on two sides of it. All of the photos on the wall are monochromatic. There is one on one side and three on the other, with the three being portrait and the one being square. The square is of a model with long hair sitting down, posing with their elbow on their knee. The other side has one photo of a fashionable blind person walking through a street with a cane, an EMT sitting in the back of an ambulance, and a turtle shell helmet with two dog tags under it.
*The wall in the middle of the floor closest to the railing overlooking the ground floor has three photos on it that are all landscape. The first one is of a flight attendant outside of a plane. The second is of two well-dressed and happy elderly people. The third is a teen hitchhiker holding a sign that reads "ANYWHERE."
*The other side of this wall has four photos. Two landscape and two portrait with the portrait photos as bookends. The first one is of a parent blue jay feeding its babies, the second is someone with an artificial arm holding a blue tube, the third is of a person with a cane walking through a graveyard, and the fourth is a child holding an injured bird in their hands.
*A wall with photos on both sides juts out from the previous one. There is one large square photo on one side, two columns of smaller photos on the other as well as one portrait photo. The one square photo is of a firefighter fighting fire. The small square photos are of a Marine, a child clinging to or hugging their parent while both are smiling, a person sitting on a street corner with a large dog in their lap, and a funeral of someone in the armed forces with the American flag draped over their coffin. The portrait photo is of one person in a wheelchair being pushed by their peer.
