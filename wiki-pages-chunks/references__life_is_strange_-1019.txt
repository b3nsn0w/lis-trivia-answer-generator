Here is a section of the wiki page for References (Life is Strange):

## Rachel Amber 
*[Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md) is likely based on Laura Palmer, a well-liked teenage girl whose mysterious disappearance sets off the plot of *Twin Peaks*. Laura Palmer and Rachel Amber share the same birthday, July 22nd.

#

## Officer Anderson Berry 
* [File:Deputy Andy Brennan Twin Peaks - Officer Anderson Berry.jpg](thumb.md) The police officer is similar to the character Dale Cooper from the series *Twin Peaks*, who also very consistently praised pies from the local caf√©. In the game, the officer praises Joyce Price's pumpkin pies at the Two Whales Diner.
* [Officer Berry](officer_anderson_berry.md) appears to be modeled after deputy [w:c:twinpeaks:Andy Brennan](any_brennan.md) from *Twin Peaks*. Apart from general similar looks, they share the same first name (Anderson, shortened to Andy) and even the prominent mole on the exact same spot, on the right, slightly above the mouth.

## Other Residents 
* The [R.J. MacReady](fisherman.md) sitting immediately to the right of the diner door is the spitting image of Detective Holder from *The Killing*.
* The man standing next to the newspaper machines when Max first visits the diner appears to be modeled after {{Wiki|Christopher_Moltisanti|Christopher Moltisanti}} from *The Sopranos*.

## Locations 

#

## Arcadia Bay 
The developers conducted research on the setting by travelling to the Pacific Northwest for the purpose of conveying a nostalgic and autumnal feel to the game. The development team visited the region, took photographs, looked at local newspapers and used Google Street View to make sure the environment was accurately portrayed. There are a lot of locations [Arcadia Bay](arcadia_bay.md) is based off.

The name, Arcadia Bay, is heavily speculated to be named after the 90's play Arcadia, by Tom Stoppard. In the play, Stoppard examines the effects of time and how the decisions we make affect the people of the future, which is a common theme found in the game.

## Two Whales Diner 
[File:Blue Moon Diner.jpg](thumb.md)
The Two Whales Diner likely is based on the Blue Moon Diner, located in {{Wiki|Beaverton, Oregon}}. The interior is incredibly similar, and there is a newspaper article in the [Plane](airplane.md) in Episode 5 with the headline "Two Moon Diner?" which connects the names of the two diners with each other. Fun fact: The official website of the Blue Moon Diner says "Welcome fellow time travelers" in the upper-left corner and someone posed as Max Caulfield in the comments, stating, "Couldn't decide between the Bacon omelette and the Belgian waffle, they're both hella good." This is a reference to Max's decision in Episode 2. Another comment, made by someone posing as Chloe Price says, "Come here all the time with my bestfriend. Love the bacon omelette its hella amazing." And someone else pretending to be Warren Graham stated, "Love this place! Me and my [Everyday Heroes Photo Contest](everyday_hero.md) always make sure to hit up this diner for an early dinner before heading off to the drive-in. Those Belgian waffles are hella tasty!"Official Blue Moon Diner website: http://bluemoondinerpdx.com/

A signed {{Wiki|Ero guro}} illustration is framed on one of the walls, fitting the atmosphere.

## Episode One - "[Episode 1: Chrysalis](chrysalis.md)" 
#

## Vision 
*The beginning of "Chrysalis" mirrors, albeit marginally, the beginning of Remedy Entertainment's Xbox 360 launch title, *{{Wiki|Alan Wake}}*. In their dreams, both Max Caulfield and Alan Wake believe the point of safety is a lighthouse seen in the distance and the player is meant to walk towards it. 
* Another possible inspiration could be the very first scene of *Donnie Darko* where he is waking up from a previous iteration of the time-loop he is stuck into: he gets up off the ground, alone, confused, in a remote area overlooking his town, having no clue how he ended up there. This is exactly what also happened to Max in the very first scene of the game.
