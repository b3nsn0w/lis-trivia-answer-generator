**Max:** Considering we're in a public diner with a police officer right over there, you shouldn't advertise your rage... Prescott.

**Nathan:** No worries. 'Cause you're the one trying to fake it till you make it. At least you were smart enough to keep your big mouth shut in the Principal's office...

Kate Marsh.Kate Marsh.**Max:** I bet you hoped Kate Marsh would stay quiet.

**Nathan:** Idiot says what?

**Max:** Did you drug her?

**Nathan:** You're so stupid, Max. You think you're so goddamn smart too! Don't push me, girl. You don't want me for an enemy, understand? Do you?

**Max:** Calm down, dude. We're in the diner...

**Nathan:** Right...Plus, you're an adult now. I can sue for dumb ass for libel. Thanks. Now fuck off, dyke!

*Max automatically leaves the conversation.*

|-|Drugs for sale.# Drugs for sale.**Max:** Listen Nathan, I'll take back everything I said about-if you hook me up with Frank...know what I mean?

**Nathan:** You look like you've never even taken a hit of baby aspirin.

**Max:** How do you think I stay wired all night studying? So is it a deal or not?

**Nathan:** Calm down, hard up. Deal. You'll get your school supplies. Just go over to Frank and whisper, "Higher Education." He'll hook your ass up...

*Max automatically leaves the conversation.*

|-|Your father.Your father.**Max:** Your sugar daddy will always protect you-and threaten me.

**Nathan:** You don't know shit about my father, or me. Nobody here does!

**Max:** Then tell me what I should know.

**Nathan:** Why? So you can pretend to care, hm? Spoiler alert, he's an asshole.

**Max:** Maybe I could help you.

**Nathan:** I don't need you for anything except to stay out of my fucking business, understand? Now get out of my face!

|-|Rachel and Frank.# Rachel and Frank.**Max:** I bet Frank hooked you and Rachel up with party supplies...

**Nathan:** Nice try. Rachel partied like a fiend on her own. More than me.

**Max:** I doubt that.

**Nathan:** Like you would know, virgin. Even that pig over there knows Rachel hung out more with Frank. I mean, don't talk to the cop about that, dumbass.

*Max automatically leaves the conversation.*

|-|Cop's information. (Cop)Cop's information. (Cop)**Max:** I heard your dad hired a local cop to keep an eye out on you and Frank Bowers...like a babysitter.

**Nathan:** Bullshit. My dad doesn't hire, he owns. And these pigs know better than to narc on me.

**Max:** Do they? I hope that means Frank won't get busted...

**Nathan:** Eventually he will. Guy is into some freaky shit. He told me once he took a weird blood oath for Rachel...Uh, forget I told you that. Seriously. Now get off my crack, whore. Keep your piehole shut.

*Max automatically leaves the conversation.*

|-|Blood Oath. (Cop's information, rewind)# Blood Oath. (Cop's information, rewind)**Max:** Weren't you supposed to keep your mouth shut about the blood oath Frank took for Rachel?

**Nathan:** Blood oath? Who-? What the fuck? I never told anybody about that freaky shit...Besides everybody knows Frank is a liar and a loser. Even Rachel did...

**Max:** Yet Rachel Amber hung out with him more than you.

**Nathan:** So? Rachel wanted Frank's stash. She let him take pictures...Then he carries around her photo like she posed for love. Dumbass.

*Max automatically leaves the conversation.*
