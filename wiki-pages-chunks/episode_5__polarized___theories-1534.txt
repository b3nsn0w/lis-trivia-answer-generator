Here is a section of the wiki page for Episode 5: Polarized - Theories:

## Sacrifice Arcadia Bay Ending 
It's been certainly confirmed by game-developers that 'the fate of other characters* *voluntarily left blurry'
* It's not explicitly shown, but highly likely that most, if not all those in the [Two Whales Diner](two_whales_diner.md), being [Warren Graham](warren_graham.md), [Joyce Price](joyce_price.md), [Frank Bowers](frank_bowers.md), (determinant) and [Pompidou](pompidou.md) (determinant), are dead in the Sacrifice [Arcadia Bay](arcadia_bay.md) ending when the full force of the [storm](storm.md) hit the town. Another thing to mention is that in the other timeline, the diner also exploded without [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md)'s intervention, which was due to a gas fire from [Frank's RV](frank_s_rv.md). But that could also depend on whether [Chloe Price](chloe.md) killed Frank in the previous episode. You may even consider this as an inside joke by the developers, it is like Schrödinger's own Arcadia Bay, everybody is dead and alive until one or the other is asserted.
** This theory is highly presumed to be false since it is revealed that Joyce died in the storm in *Life is Strange 2*, leading to the conclusion that Frank, Pompidou, and Warren had died too.
* Although it's never explained what or who brings the storm into fruition, the fact that Max has vision of the storm before her power triggers may be indicative that Max's powers have no connection to the storm whatsoever, making the nature of the storm unavoidable, the nature of Max's first vision premonitory and the final decision might be all about letting Nature take its courses and wipe out Arcadia Bay, allowing Max to keep Chloe at her side or given the premonition, thwart destiny by making the ultimate sacrifice and allow Arcadia Bay to be spared. This doesn't hold as well when one considers the fact that the storm never happens if Chloe is killed by Nathan Prescott in the bathroom, however. Whether her powers create the event or not isn't explicitly clear, but using them to change Chloe's fate is directly tied to the storm itself and therefore can be seen as a result of abusing her powers to change fate.
* While it is never explicitly stated whether anyone other than Max and Chloe survived the storm in the Sacrifice Arcadia Bay ending, it should be noted that the Two Whales Diner is seen still standing after the storm, much like it was when Max was there before she saved Chloe using [Media:Max Warren photo.png](warren_s_photo.md). Even though we didn't see any survivors, it is entirely possible that Joyce, Warren, Frank, and Pompidou were able to survive the storm, staying sheltered in the diner, especially considering the butterfly effect Max's last interference with time might have caused.
** In *Life is Strange 2*, it is revealed that Joyce died in the storm, which means that Warren, Frank, and Pompidou may have died too, leading this theory to be proven false.
* [David Madsen](david.md) may have also survived the storm if Chloe is spared by the player, as during the storm he tracks down [Mark Jefferson](mr__jefferson.md) in the [Dark Room (Location)](dark_room.md) (with the help of policemen). So he may have survived and been safe in the Dark Room underground, which was also described as a "storm bunker". However, that also means that Jefferson is likely to survive the storm as well. Alternatively, it’s also possible that David was killed by Jefferson as he wasn't able to overpower him without Max's help.
** The former theory was proven to be correct in *Life is Strange 2*, although Jefferson's fate is still unknown. 
* If the player managed to save [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md) in [Episode 2: Out of Time](episode_2.md), there is a chance that she survived in the Sacrifice Arcadia Bay ending. Although she told Max that her parents were merely coming to visit her at the [hospital](hospital.md) and never explicitly said that they would be picking her up and taking her out of town on Friday. The hospital is a solid brick building and it would have been able to withstand the storm as opposed to the destroyed wooden buildings that are shown in this ending. Also, hospitals usually have underground storm shelters. Additionally, in Arcadia Bay's main map, the hospital wasn't shown, which heavily also implies that the hospital was out of the town. However, this is speculation and Kate is widely presumed to be dead.
** In *Life is Strange 2*, David reveals that all the Arcadia Bay residents had died in the storm (leaving him, Max, Chloe, Victoria, and presumbly Jefferson the only survivors), meaning that Kate may be among them.
* It's possible that [Victoria Chase](victoria_chase.md) is safe and sound with [Raymond Wells](principal_wells.md) in [San Francisco](san_francisco.md) in the Sacrifice Arcadia Bay ending, because if not Max, she would be the winner of the [Everyday Heroes Photo Contest](everyday_heroes_photo_contest.md). However, this depends on whether the player warned Victoria, or on the butterfly effect, if Jefferson kidnapped her anyway.
** In *Life is Strange 2*, it is revealed that Victoria survived the storm because she was kidnapped by Jefferson and taken to the bunker. She was then rescued by David.
* It's unknown if all the residents of Arcadia Bay died in the Sacrifice Arcadia Bay ending, although we have seen a lot of deaths that are likely determined without Max's intervention. A document in the [Barn](prescott_barn.md)It says that that the [Prescott Family](prescotts.md) brought "a bomb shelter boom to town". indicates that there are a lot of bunkers all over the town, but whether any of the residents actually knew about the bunkers or managed to make it to some of them isn't
