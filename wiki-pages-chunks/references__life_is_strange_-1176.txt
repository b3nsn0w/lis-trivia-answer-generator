Here is a section of the wiki page for References (Life is Strange):

## Blackwell Academy 
*When looking at a cairn in front of the [Tobanga Totem](tobanga_totem.md) (before talking to Samuel about the dead birds), Max remarks that it is "way too Blair Witch" for her, referring to the 1999 American found footage horror film *{{Wiki|The Blair Witch Project}}.*
*[Daniel DaCosta](daniel_dacosta.md) wears a T-shirt featuring a man tipping his hat. The "Tips Hat" meme is part of a series of "fedora shaming" jokes aimed at making fun of nerdy men who wear fedoras as a fashion accessory.
*In a dialog, Ms. Grant makes a reference to "{{Wiki|A Sound of Thunder}}", a short story by Ray Bradbury involving time travel.
*Warren's room slate says, "There is no unique picture of reality - {{Wiki|Stephen Hawking}}".
*There is a poster advertising the "Gamer Guyz" club on the boys' dormitory wall. It says that they're playing and analyzing games from "CoD" to "WoW", which refers to the popular games {{Wiki|Call of Duty}} and {{Wiki|World of Warcraft}}.
*In [Nathan's Room](nathan_s_room.md), a certificate for "The Best Son in the World" is dated June 6, 2006. 666 is considered the "Number of the Beast" in the {{Wiki|Book of Revelation}}.
*The images in the slideshow in Nathan's room could be references to the German Expressionism style of photography and film, as large dense shapes and points are used. The backgrounds are highly reminiscent of *{{Wiki|The_Cabinet_of_Dr._Caligari|The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari}}*. It tells the story of an insane hypnotist who uses a somnambulist to commit murders. This can be seen as an allegory for Nathan's entanglement in Jefferson's Dark Room deeds as a manipulated victim out of their own control.
*After beating up Nathan in the Prescott Dormitory, Warren offers to stick with Chloe and Max, just in case they need him "to get [his] Hulk on again", referring to the Marvel character and superhero Bruce Banner who turns into {{Wiki|Hulk (comics)#Bruce Banner|Hulk}}, a large green humanoid that possesses superhuman strength and invulnerability when he is angered.

## [Beach](beach.md) 
* Frank calls Max and Chloe the "Wonder Twins" and the "Hardy Boys".
* On Frank's coded list, he lists 'Lupin:Tonks', which may be a reference to the two characters (Remus Lupin & Nymphadora Tonks) and couple from *{{Wiki|Harry Potter}}*.

#

## Chloe's Room 
*After finding the right evidence to try to crack the pin on Nathan's phone, Max states that all she has to do is "blow this code up and go home", quoting Han Solo encouraging Luke before the Death Star destruction in the 1977 *Star Wars* movie *A New Hope*.
*One of the names on Frank Bowers' client list is Stifler, based on the character from the *American Pie* films.

## Prescott Barn and Dark Room 
*When observing the old car in front of the [Prescott Barn](prescott_barn.md) while finding a way into it, Max says, "Watson, we can safely assume that this ancient vehicle is not our suspect", another reference to *Sherlock Holmes*.
*When Max discovers an entrance into the Barn, Chloe calls her Maximus. "Maximus" is a Latin term and given name, meaning "greatest" or "large". Maximus is also the name of the protagonist of the 2000 film* "Gladiator*", directed by Ridley Scott, and portrayed by Russel Crowe.
*When entering the old barn, Max says, "This is way too Blair Witch", another reference to *The Blair Witch Project*.

*When Max notices a hook used to lift haystacks, she mentions seeing them in one of the *{{Wiki|Friday the 13th}}* films.
*When Max approaches the owl in the barn, she calls it "Doctor Hoo", which is another reference to the British time travel series *Doctor Who*. It's often remarked by fans that {{Wiki|Peter Capaldi}}, who currently portrays the Doctor, looks like an owl.
*Max can comment that she would need Gandalf's help to open the bunker's door. Gandalf is a powerful wizard in *{{Wiki|The Lord of the Rings}}*.
*When Max solves the problem of opening the Stormbreaker Bunker door, she makes another reference to the 1980s television series, *MacGyver*, when she says, "MaxGyver strikes again!"
