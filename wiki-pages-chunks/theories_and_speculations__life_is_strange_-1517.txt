Here is a section of the wiki page for Theories and Speculations (Life is Strange):

## Max's Powers 
* Some fans have suggested Max's original experience of the storm to be the actual reality point the game is based on. She would then be [Rewind](rewinding.md) to the day in [Mark Jefferson](mr__jefferson.md)'s class right before all the strange events began that threw her life off the rails until the storm wiped out Arcadia Bay. Max might thus be trying to cope with survivor's guilt, hypothetically moving back and forth in her timeline experimenting with what she could have done differently. Further, supporting this theory is the fact that when Chloe pulls Max out from the "storm vision" at the lighthouse, during the end of "Chrysalis" her arm has a jacket sleeve, the same jacket she is wearing in the end sequence of the last episode "Polarized". In the end of  "Chrysalis" Chloe is wearing sleeveless shirt.
* At a given time Max can use her laptop for research about her power, after opening a page about {{Wiki|Wormhole}} Theory, she will comment on how that theory makes sense. If taken into account how her power works during the rewind Max may actually be right. She may indeed open a wormhole in the fabric of time, (not space), allowing her to go back in time and not to have moved at all in space. This would also explain why pause rewind is harder for Max to perform, in Kate's rescue, under this theory when she pauses time, she actually has to open a wormhole in the fabric space/time as she needs to move herself as well. Further, supporting this theory, is the fact that the rewind position in the timeline is indicated by a "swirl meter" that resembles a crude drawing of a wormhole, in the left upper corner of the screen.
* Although it's never explained what or who brings the storm into fruition, the fact that Max has vision of the storm before her power triggers may be indicative that Max's powers have no connection to the storm whatsoever, making the nature of the storm unavoidable, the nature of Max's first vision premonitory and the final decision might be all about letting Nature take its course and wipe out Arcadia Bay, allowing Max to keep Chloe at her side or given the premonition, thwart destiny by making the ultimate sacrifice and allow Arcadia Bay to be spared.
* Oddly or not, the main character, Max or the deuteragonists, in Rachel's and Daniel's case, of [Life is Strange (Franchise)](life_is_strange.md) games, that can, (presumably in Rachel's case), wield powers have what you may consider very different alignments. Max can be considered an example of "good", peace, justice, humility and sacrifice, Rachel can be considered as an example of "evil", violence, vengeful, prideful and selfish, while Daniel can be considered the "neutral", the clean slate, ignorant and pure.
* Chloe seems to be indeed connected to Max's power or may even be the source of it. Several facts support this theory, the blue butterfly, which happens to be Chloe's spirit animal, appears right before the "trigger event", in the "sacrifice Chloe ending" if Max doesn't look at Chloe, the power simply doesn't trigger, the triggering event itself brought into reality Chloe's greatest wish, the reunion with her long-lost best friend, and even Max and Chloe seem to believe this at certain points in the story.
* Max's powers may take a subtle and unexpected toll on her, as she makes the following remark at Chloe's house in the alternative timeline, while looking in a mirror: "How's it going, time tripper? Funny, I think I look older..." However, stress and extreme tiredness can make someone think they look older when they stare at their reflection in a mirror, so Max's comment may not mean anything beyond this.

## Multiverse Theories 
* In this theory, rather than Max having the ability to rewind time, she, in fact, has the ability to warp to another universe where the events of what she tries to undo have not happened yet. This theory would explain why no one ever notices her teleporting, as the other universe would automatically provide a logical reason for her being in that particular place. This would mean that there should be at least one universe for every position Max could be in and every angle Max could be looking at.

* In "Polarized", Max has to stop Chloe from going to the [End of the World Party](end_of_the_world_party.md). If she tells Chloe nothing when Chloe asks what she did, Max will go on to explain that she creates alternate realities every time she goes back in time (or at least through pictures), but Chloe tells her not to doubt herself. This comes up again in Max's nightmare sequence. Even if this is not true, Max herself is sure of it.

* It's unclear whether Max changes reality or creates new timelines that run and exist parallel to each other for each time she rewinds and alters the past. If the second was confirmed, the end would not boil down to "save the city or save Chloe", but Max would only decide which reality she preferred to live in. In other words, even if Max sacrificed Chloe, the tornado would still be going on, but in another reality that she left behind.

## Chloe Price 
* A likely theory which ties the game together was that Max would need to rewind using the butterfly photo she took in the [Blackwell Academy](blackwell_academy.md) bathroom before Chloe was shot by Nathan. Going back to the beginning of the game, Max would need to let Chloe die in order to correct the [timeline](timeline.md) and put a halt to the eco-disaster befalling Arcadia Bay. On the other hand, it seemed contradictory that the eco-disaster still exists despite Chloe's death in the [Alternative Timeline (Life is Strange)](alternate_timeline.md).

* Another discussed scenario was that Max would step in on this moment and calm Nathan's rage in order to save Chloe and placate Nathan. However, this would be less likely, as Chloe's death is predicted symbolically in the game, and keeping her alive would not correct the wrongs in time; she was originally meant to die.

* Another theory was that the cause of the upcoming disastrous tornado was caused by Chloe's wrath toward her miserable destiny, such as the loss of [William Price](her_father.md) and Rachel Amber. Considering the scene at the end of "Chrysalis", when Max falls into her premonition of the storm right after Chloe curses Arcadia Bay, it is possible that Chloe could be a destructive power against the world, and Max's duty is to save the world and Chloe.
* Another strange theory about Chloe was that she was somehow connected to the supernatural powers, that manifested themselves in the main character and/or deuteragonists, of Life is Strange universe. While this was proven true for a while and can certainly still be possible for Max and/or Rachel, Daniel completely disproves this theory.
