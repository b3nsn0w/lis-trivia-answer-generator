* Warren trying to take a picture of himself with Max in the [Blackwell Parking Lot](parking_lot.md) outside the [End of the World Party](end_of_the_world_party.md): "Say 'cheese,' dumbshit." [File:Headphones.png](16px.md)
*The following unused audio conversation was meant to take place in the Blackwell parking lot after we hear the following line from Chloe, *"I hear you, Max... but do you think we should let Jefferson get away with torture and murder?"* There were originally two choices planned aside from telling David about Jefferson: go to the police (active), or let karma deal with Jefferson (passive).
****Max chooses "police":**
***Max: "No! We go to the police and let them take over. We have plenty of evidence." {{Headphones|file# Max-police.ogg}}
***Chloe: "Who owns the police here? And they'd probably put us in a fucking cell! Max, I know you're still in shock over what happened... but we have to face this reality... Let's go get him!" {{Headphones|fileChloe-police.ogg}}
****Max chooses "karma":**
***Max: "As long as you're alive, I don't care. Karma will catch up to him eventually." {{Headphones|file# Max-karma.ogg}}
***Chloe: "I'd like to think that and just take off with you right now.But Max... I don't trust karma anymore. Rachel deserves justice. Now. With our help..." {{Headphones|fileChloe-karma.ogg}}
****If Max chooses "David", and after Chloe asks Max why they should involve/trust him:**
***Max:"I know he's been difficult, but... he's the only one who knows what's going on and he's the only one who can help us." {{Headphones|file# Max-involve-david.ogg}}
*Said by Max at the end of the parking lot scene when she takes Chloe's hand. It was probably cut due to redundancy as it's already clear that Chloe is following: "Now follow me…"Max's line in the current version of the game (v1.0.0.397609), "I’ll always believe you, Chloe", sounds much more impactive. {{Headphones|fileMax-follow-me.ogg}}
*Max's original line before it was tweaked for better structure, pacing and cadence in the version we hear in the game: "Yes, you are. So listen: In a few minutes, I won't know any of this happened... Nothing. You have to tell me exactly what I did and said... Just explain that I traveled through time using the photo... We have to stay in your room and do nothing. Then we explain everything to David... and we finally let him do his job."The line as it appears in the current version of the game (v1.0.0.397609): "Yes, you are. So, listen... In a few minutes, I won't know any of this happened... nothing. We absolutely have to stay in your room and do nothing. Then we explain everything to David, and we finally let him do his job. You'll have to tell me exactly what I did and said just now. Just explain that I traveled through time using the photo." {{Headphones|file# Max-remember-nothing-game.ogg}} {{Headphones|fileMax-remember-nothing-alt.ogg}}
* Kate in Max's nightmare depending on Max's success on saving Kate either thanking her or accusing her: "Max, you saved me. Thank you. Bless your soul. I think you need it. An angel can contain many forms, Max. How many more people will you save?" "Max, all I can say is... A-Fucking-Men." "Max, did you see me fall? Did you? I can't believe you would let me die like that. Gross. I thought you had special powers, Max.
