he spies on all of us here.

**David:** Don't start, Chloe.

**Chloe:** Yeah, I'm just always starting shit, right? You're a total paranoid, David.

**David:** Not now, Chloe.

**Chloe:** You used to call me a loser for getting kicked out of Blackwell... So who's the loser now, David? Who haven't you accused or harassed? Between your investigations into Rachel and Kate, what have you done besides get in trouble?

SIDE WITH DAVIDSIDE WITH DAVID**Max:** Listen, we don't know that David did anything and nobody has any proof against him. As far as we know, it's Nathan Prescott who's the real threat so far. I would cut David slack here...

**Chloe:** Oh would you? How generous, King Max. So suddenly it doesn't matter how shady David has been acting, or that he keeps all those weird files on your classmates, or how you're always going off on how creepy Davidâ€”

**Joyce:** Enough! I don't want anybody being accused of anything. There's been too much of that crap going on around here lately and I don't want it in my home today.

**David:** Well, I agree with that. Now if you all don't mind, I'd like to forget about work and sit down, and eat some of this incredible grub...

**Chloe:** I have to take a dump. Are you coming, Max?

*David and Joyce sit at the table. Chloe goes towards the front door of the house.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Maybe I went too easy on David for Joyce's sake...

**Optional Conversation with David**

**David:** Thanks again for defending me, Max. But this is my family now.

**Optional Conversation with Joyce**

**Joyce:** Max, I appreciate you sticking up for David... and our family. Even if Chloe doesn't.

**Optional Conversation with Chloe**

**Chloe:** Thanks for letting me down again, Max. Why can't you just rewind so I don't have to see you defending that asshole?

{{#tag:tabber|(Blamed Chloe/Stayed hidden)(Blamed Chloe/Stayed hidden)**Max:** You're a bully, David. I saw you harass Kate Marsh when she was going through hell. You could have totally helped her. Everybody at Blackwell is a suspect to you, except for Nathan Prescott... That's why the students and faculty don't like you. You even hit your stepdaughter. I do respect your service, but you don't respect anybody.

**David:** Chloe was doing drugs. That's illegal.

**Max:** So is spying on people in your family and at your work. Why do you have photos of Kate Marsh and Rachel Amber in your files anyway?

**Joyce:** What? Is this true, Max? Yes, David, why do you have these files at all? I find this very disturbing.

**David:** I do not have to take this kind of interrogation. Not from you punks!

**Joyce:** Maybe you should calm down...

**David:** Oh, you're turning on me now? Of course, women always stick together. Well, screw you!

**Joyce:** David... you better go to a hotel until we figure this out...

**David:** You can't kick me out of my own home!

**Joyce:** It's my home, David. Paid for and in my name. You know the law, right?

**David:** I thought I knew a lot of things... like when I'm outflanked.

**Chloe:** Have a nice day.

**Joyce:** Chloe, for once... just please shut up.

*David goes to the door leading to the backyard. Joyce sits at the table. Chloe goes towards the front door of the house.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* I hope Joyce doesn't hate me for tearing into David...

**Optional Conversation with David**

**David:** I don't want to see or hear you again, Max. You've hurt me and my family enough.

**Optional Conversation with Joyce**

**Joyce:** Max, don't beat yourself up. David earned this all by himself, understand?

**Optional Conversation with Chloe**

**Chloe:** Max, that gave me chills. And you better not rewind this one!

''Max and Chloe exit Chloe's house and drive towards the Two Whales Diner.''
