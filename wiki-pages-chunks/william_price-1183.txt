  September 21, 2008 - November 27, 2008 William died in 2008 when Max was aged
  13 (evidenced by the in-game dialogue, "I'm 18 years old inside my **13** year
  old self... How?", and the journal entry: "Then I found myself actually back
  in the photo... to when I was **13** years old. I was back in Chloe's kitchen
  in the year **2008**."). This time period is the only period that William
  could have died, because this is the only time period in 2008 where Max would
  be 13 years old. It is also almost certain that William died before Joyce met
  David Madsen, on November 27, 2008 according to the Diner receipt which is
  used to unlock David's computer in Episode 3. In the prequel *Before the
  Storm*, it seems to be implied that William died on 9/28/2008 at 11:57 a.m.
  from the timestamps on Joyce's texts during [Chloe's Dreams
'Chloe''s dream](chloe_s_dreams__chloe__s_dream.md). This day was a Sunday, explaining why Max and Chloe stayed at home that day. Originally, the timestamp was 6/21/2008 but it was updated to the current one after the release of Episode 2: Brave New World, probably due to a possible [Canon Inconsistencies': *

## Background 
William Price lived alongside Joyce in [Arcadia Bay](arcadia_bay.md) with their daughter, Chloe. Before her birth in March 1994, William and Joyce visited [San Francisco](san_francisco.md) on holiday. In the year 1999 they bought Chloe a kitten named [Bongo](bongo.md).

William was an amicable, kindhearted and gentle man and family father who enjoyed entertaining Chloe and her best friend, Max, in their youth by hosting activities such as barbecues in their backyard. He also shared Max's passion for photography.

In 2008, Bongo the cat was killed by a passing car. In the original timeline, William also died in 2008 when involved in a car crash whilst driving to pick up Joyce who was shopping for groceries. Chloe and Joyce were devastated by the loss. Some time before his death, he started to paint the front of his house in blue, but he was never able to finish it, and so it remained unfinished as it was. In [Episode 3: Chaos Theory](episode_3.md), Chloe states that Joyce blames herself for the event, and that occasionally, so does she.
