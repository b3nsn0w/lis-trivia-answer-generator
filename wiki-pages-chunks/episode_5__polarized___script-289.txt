Here is a section of the wiki page for Episode 5: Polarized - Script:

Joyce, you've gone through so much for Chloe and David. If you were my mom... I would be so proud.

**Joyce:** Oh sweetie, thank you. But your parents should be prouder of you. Even David told me how tough he thinks you are... and he doesn't give out many compliments, as you know.

{{#tag:tabber|David needs you.David needs you.
**Max:** He does about you. Itâ€™s so obvious he needs you in his life...

**Joyce:** He better. Like I said, people don't always see the real David Madsen. I hope Chloe does someday...

{{!}}-{{!}}David is a hero.# David is a hero.
**Max:** David is a real hero. I don't know what he's gone through in war, but I can imagine... and he even showed me how to find my own strength under extreme conditions.

**Joyce:** I'm so glad to hear you say that, Max... I know he's not always an easy person to defend... Most people only see him at his worst... You've seen him at his best. And that's the man I want in my life.
