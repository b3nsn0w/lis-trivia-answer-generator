Here is a section of the wiki page for Nathan Prescott:

## Episode Five - "[Episode 5: Polarized](polarized.md)" 
After Chloe gets shot at the junkyard and Max gets kidnapped by Jefferson, he reveals to her that Nathan was killed by him the evening before and that he only wanted Nathan as a scapegoat. He was taking full advantage of Nathan's mental health issues and his bad relationship with his father, and soon became a new father figure to this struggling boy. He manipulated Nathan so that he could lure girls to the Dark Room and drug them for Jefferson's twisted photoshoots. Jefferson also *claims* that Nathan accidentally killed Rachel Amber with a drug overdose while trying to imitate him.

Jefferson also reveals that he got rid of Nathan and buried him somewhere "where no one will ever find him". Max can discover a ticket to Los Angeles with Nathan’s name on it, likely bought in order to hide the fact that Nathan is dead, with people assuming he has gone to look for Rachel as she was assumed by some (including Chloe) to be in Los Angeles. When Max is freed from the Dark Room by David Madsen, she discovers a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v-Z5loua0-Kc voicemail] by Nathan on her phone that was sent only shortly before his death, in which he is tearful and apologizes for everything he has done and tries to tell Max about his fate and warn her that Jefferson is coming for her next.

''"Max... it's Nathan. I just wanted to say... I'm sorry. I didn't want to hurt Kate, or Rachel, or... I didn't want to hurt anybody. Everybody... used me! Mr. Jefferson is coming for me now. All this shit will be over soon. Watch out, Max... He wants to hurt you next. Sorry."''

It is not revealed how he knew or how he is killed, and why he chose to warn Max instead of calling the police.

Nathan appears again in the maze area of [Max's Nightmare](max_s_nightmare.md), threatening and blaming her for not helping him or letting him get beaten up by Warren, but also saying disgusting lines like, *"It’s going to be so sweet when I bury your carcass next to Rachel and do an epic photo shoot"*, ''"Do you want to say hello to Rachel? She's posing for me in hell"*, or *"Holy fucking shit, Max… That was hilarious when you guys dug up Rachel’s body! Ha, ha, ha!"*

In the Two Whales Diner scene, he says, *"Max, I'm… truly… I truly am sorry for being such a bastard. You would have been cool to hang out with. I just don’t want everybody else to suffer like me." ''

## Episode Five - "[Episode 5: Wolves](wolves.md)" 
Nathan is mentioned by and can be seen in a mugshot kept by [David Madsen (Life is Strange 2)](david_madsen.md) if the former killed Chloe. He was booked on the day after the murder. [Sean Diaz](sean_diaz.md) can inspect the mugshot and finds David's possession of it creepy. During a phone call to Joyce, David can say that he hopes "they never let him out".

## Alternative Timeline 
When Max enters the Alternative Timeline, Nathan can be seen talking to Zachary on the Blackwell Campus lawn. Max is a member of the Vortex Club and sits in the same group on the lawn. Nathan and Max seem to be friends since he texts her about hanging out, and according to Victoria's texts, he is worried about Max after she ran off suddenly (to Chloe's house).

## Associated Deaths 
* [Chloe Price](chloe_price.md) (**Caused, Direct, Determinant**) - Nathan accidentally shoots her in the Blackwell Girls Bathroom in the original timeline. This is rewound by Max in Episode 1. However, at the end of the story, if Max chooses to save Arcadia Bay, Chloe's death is inevitable as in the original timeline.
* [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md) (**Involved, Indirectly Caused, Determinant**) - It is implied that Nathan dosed Kate, as she tells Max that he had been the one to offer to take her to the hospital and did not. This dosing led to her viral video which is the main contribution to her suicide/suicide attempt.
* [Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md) (**Caused, Accidental**) - It is revealed by Mark Jefferson that Nathan had a lust for Rachel, and kidnapped her to follow in Mark Jefferson's footsteps by photographing her while she was drugged, but he accidentally overdosed her.
