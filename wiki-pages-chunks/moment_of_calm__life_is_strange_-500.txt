:*For the song by Eduard Frolov, see [Moment of Calm (song)](moment_of_calm__song_.md).*
**"A Moment of Calm"** is an optional gameplay element in *[Life is Strange](life_is_strange.md)*. The concept was picked up again for the prequel, *[Life is Strange: Before the Storm](life_is_strange__before_the_storm.md)* and in [Life is Strange 2](life_is_strange_2.md)'s free demo, [The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit](the_awesome_adventures_of_captain_spirit.md). Moments of Calm are special moments in the game when the protagonist may sit or lean against an object and contemplate their current situation. Relaxing music is usually played in the background. They usually provide additional information or the protagonist's inner thoughts and give the player a chance to rest.
