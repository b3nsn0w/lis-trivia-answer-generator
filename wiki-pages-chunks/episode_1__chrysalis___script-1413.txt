'''Courtney and Taylor's conversation**

**Courtney:** Why would anybody want to carry around a dorky instamatic?

**Taylor:** Because Max wants everybody to see how hip she is.

**Taylor:''' She's so fucking shy she takes selfies with a giant camera.

'''[Justin Williams](justin.md) and [Dana Ward](dana.md)'s conversation**

**Justin:** When I have to get my education on. And see you.

**Dana:** You should take a smoke break.

**Justin:** Dana, I have. I haven't smoked since... I haven't smoked since I woke up at seven.

**Dana:** What's the point of even coming to class if you're baked?

**Justin:** What's the point of coming to class, period?

**Dana:** Okay, rebel.

**Justin:** Besides, why do you think they call it "high school"?

**Dana:** You are such a dork I can never get mad at you.

**Justin:** Want to take a quick rip of my new Fire OG?

**Conversation between [Logan Robertson](logan.md), his friend and [Daniel DaCosta](daniel.md)**

**Friend:** Yeah, payday...

**Logan:** I know you didn't forget you owe us cash.

**Daniel:** I forgot for what.

**Logan:** For making sure nobody kicks your ass.

**Friend:** Yeah, your ass.

**Daniel:** Logan, seriously, leave me alone.

**Logan:** You're not the boss of me, bro.

**Friend:** Not the boss, bro.

**Daniel:** No, I'm, I'm...I'm just trying to go to class.

'''Juliet and Zachary's conversation**

**Zachary:''' Don't even tease me.

**Juliet:** You know I don't tease.

**Zachary:** I hate that science class with those nerds.

**Juliet:** What's that got to do with anything?

**Zachary:** Uh, because if you send me a picture I won't be bored.

**Juliet:** You suck.

'''[Samuel Taylor](samuel.md)'s comments**

**Samuel:''' I don't mind the mopping, but can't you pick up your damn feet? Poor girl. Nobody should vanish like that... I feel like a ghost to these kids. They barely see me. This is an excellent mop, however. I keep it clean. Dragging dirty tracks everywhere.
