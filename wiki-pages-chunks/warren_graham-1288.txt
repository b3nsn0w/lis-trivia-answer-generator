Here is a section of the wiki page for Warren Graham:

## Alternative Timeline 
[File:Warren and Stella.jpg](thumb.md) In the alternative timeline, Warren is clearly in a relationship with [Stella Hill](stella_hill.md). We do not know how they ended up together, although it makes some sense considering their shared interest in academics.

## Relationships 
#

## Friends 
* [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) - Warren and Max continue to be close friends, regardless of Max's choices. Their shared interests and positions as nerds in the Blackwell social society give them the basis for a strong friendship. It is sometimes strained when Warren presses with his romantic interest in Max, though she can choose whether or not to support them (such as by accepting his invitation to go to the movies). (*See [Max and Warren](here.md) for more information on their relationship.*)
* [Brooke Scott](brooke_scott.md) - Although Brooke is interested in Warren romantically, the two have a friendship in the meantime. Warren sees her as the first person to talk to after Max as he will tell her about the drive-in (either asking her or bragging that Max agreed).
* [Luke Parker](luke_parker.md) - When Luke hears that Warren beat up Nathan, he is satisfied and cheers him as well.
* [Chloe Price](chloe_price.md) - Although Warren and Chloe don't seem to have met, Chloe texts him regarding Max and the two seem to get on well. Chloe also admires the fact that Warren headbutted Nathan and highly praises him for that.
* [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md) - Kate and Warren are friendly with each other and talk with each other from time to time. He shows genuine concern for her situation as it worsens. When Kate leaves the school building after her talk with Jefferson in Episode 2, Warren is very concerned about her and heads to Jefferson's class to talk to Max about it. Kate later talks very positively about Warren to Max calling him a "cutie-pie" and suggests to take him with her to their tea-shop tour of [Portland](portland.md) after her suicide attempt. She also supports Max's date with Warren if she accepted his invitation to the drive-in.
* [Alyssa Anderson](alyssa_anderson.md) - Warren and Alyssa share an affection for science fiction and seem to be talking a lot about films, but also about Max (for example he told her that Max borrowed his flash-drive and that she also likes science fiction). Since Max and Warren regularly spend some time together, Max will become the target of Brooke's jealousy. Warren also comforts Alyssa when Kate is about to jump from the dormitory roof. A scribble on a table in the science lab that reads "Warren+Alyssa 2013" indicates that one or both of them have been interested in each other.

#

## Family 
* Little is known about Warren's family. On his "Student Information Sheet", it is written that he was born in Arcadia Bay, Oregon. He appears to have two parents/guardians as two signatures appear in this field. They seem to be very doting individuals regarding his academics as he hints that even an A- grade would be unsatisfactory to them. The house number of the family home is 32, but the street name is illegible apart from appearing to be a compound that begins with the letter "S".The street name on Warren's "Student Information Sheet" does not seem to reflect any of the [https://geographic.org/streetview/usa/or/tillamook/garibaldi.html existing street names] in the town of Garibaldi, Oregon, upon which Arcadia Bay is based.

#

## Enemies 
* [Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md) - Due to Nathan's antagonism against Max, and the reprehensible nature of Nathan's activities, Warren considers him an enemy. Warren puts himself between Nathan and Max in the parking lot, getting a black eye as a result. Later on, when Nathan is about to attack Max in the male dormitory, Warren again puts himself between them. Warren head-butts Nathan to the floor, causing Nathan to pull out a gun and levy a death threat against Warren, Max, and Chloe. Warren kicks the gun out of Nathan's hand, and (if Max chooses not to intervene) proceeds to severely beat Nathan with his fists.

#

## Romantic 
* [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) - Warren has an affection for Max and on occasion presses his romantic interest on her. Warren will fight Nathan to keep Nathan away from hurting Max at the Blackwell parking lot and later in the dormitory area. Max gets to choose whether to encourage these, such as by accepting Warren's invitation to the movies, helping Warren with his science practical and grade, choosing not to kiss Chloe and to write the copper tellurium relationship on Warren's room slate. Warren will regard Max as an angel and a superhero if Max succeeds in saving Kate, or will provide support by telling Max that she was the only person there for Kate if Max fails in saving Kate. Warren will keep Max warm when he sees Max is uncomfortable with the sudden change in temperature from the eclipse. When Max asks him to give her the photograph of the night at the Vortex Club, before focusing on the photo, she has the option to leave, hug or kiss Warren. If she decides to kiss him, Warren tells Max he's always wanted to tell her something, but Max cuts him off and tells him she knows.
* [Brooke Scott](brooke_scott.md) (**Determinant**) - They seem to often hang out together and share the same affection for science. If Max rejects Warren's invitation to go to the movies, Warren asks Brooke instead. If Max accepts Warren's invitation, Brooke will appear noticeably jealous of Max.
* [Stella Hill](stella_hill.md) - In the Alternative Timeline, Stella and Warren appear to be in a relationship.
