Here is a section of the wiki page for Chloe Price:

## Equipment 
'''Chloe's Truck''' - Despite not having a driver's license, Chloe drives an old brown pick-up truck which she has decorated haphazardly with graffiti and stickers. On the dashboard stands an Elvis bobblehead with a microphone, and hanging from the rear-view mirror is a Sheriff's badge, a skull, a feather, and a small chain.

**Gun (Determinant)** - Prior to the game, Chloe stole a revolver from David's gun rack for protection against her enemies, mainly Nathan and Frank. In Episode 2, she does target practice at the junkyard with help from Max. When Frank arrives and Max threatens to shoot him, it's up to Max to decide if Chloe keeps the gun (Shoot) or if Frank steals it from her (Don't Shoot). If she loses the gun, Max can obtain it again from Frank's RV. It is also possible for Chloe to steal a gun from Nathan in Episode 4, if Max allowed Warren to beat him up.

**Key Ring** - In Episode 3, Chloe steals a ring of keys from David. She attempts to use it to break into the Principal's office, only to find there isn't a key for the desired door.

**Lock Picks** - Prior to the game, Chloe learned lock-picking from Frank. In Episode 3, having failed to find a key to the Principal's office, she attempts to pick the door's lock with little success.

**Necklace** - Chloe always wears her necklace of three bullets throughout the game. In Episode 5, before Max uses the photo to save Chloe from Jefferson, it is present on the computer table in the Dark Room. Max expresses her wish to save Chloe for the last time when looking at it.

## Deaths 
Chloe has many instances in which she could die with or without Max's power:

#

## Episode One - "Chrysalis" 
* Nathan shoots Chloe in her stomach, but Max rewinds to save her.

#

## Episode Two - "Out of Time" 
* Chloe is almost crushed by a train before Max rewinds in order to reroute the train.
* She accidentally shoots herself in the chest after a bullet ricochets off the car bumper in the junkyard - also saved by Max rewinding (avoidable).

#

## Episode Four - "Dark Room" 
* Chloe dies in the alternative timeline if Max accepts her request to overdose her.
* She gets shot in the forehead by Jefferson after he drugs Max in the junkyard.

#

## Episode Five - "Polarized" 
* Chloe is presumably killed during the storm while Max and Principal Wells are at the Zeitgeist Gallery.
* If Max chooses to sacrifice Chloe, Max travels to the moment when she took the photo in the bathroom. In doing so, Chloe dies the exact way she did in "Chrysalis," restoring the original timeline and stopping the storm from ever happening.

## Associated Deaths 
*[Frank Bowers](frank_bowers.md) **(Caused, Determinant)** - While Max and Chloe talk to Frank about Rachel on the beach in front of his RV, Chloe can shoot Frank and Pompidou with David's or Nathan's gun if he gets aggressive towards them because of reasons in their conversation (i.e. he finds out they broke into his RV). This is, however, avoidable with the right dialog choices.
*[Pompidou](pompidou.md) **(Indirectly Caused, Determinant)** - Pompidou can get run over by a truck on the street while running after a bone thrown by Max in Episode 3. Chloe gives Max the choice to throw the bone therefore she holds complicity for Pompidou's death.
*[Pompidou](pompidou.md) **(Caused, Determinant)** - If Frank has Pompidou nearby and he gets aggressive during their confrontation in Episode 4, Chloe may shoot both. This is, however, avoidable with the right dialog choices.

## Relationships 
'''The degree of advancement in certain relationships (particularly Chloe and Max's) is up to Max in many instances. Therefore their relationship is determinant, as with most characters in the game.'''
