Here is a section of the wiki page for Young Max and Chloe:

## Environmental Details 
* *'Two Whales Diner hasn't changed –''' The Two Whales Diner looked exactly the same when Max last ate there (age 13)Max: "Man, that smell of breakfast and the sound of clanging silverware... makes me feel thirteen again..." (Episode 2 - Two Whales Diner.) as it looks years later.Max: "Talk about going back in time... I haven't seen the diner in five years, but it looks exactly the same." (Episode 2 - *Journal*.)
* **More fishermen –** Arcadia Bay's fishing industry was thriving back when Max and Chloe were kids. Evidence of the fishing community was more apparent.Max: "There are way less fishermen and way more dumped food carts than when we were kids. Chloe and I had the best backdrop to play pirate: old ships and a big ocean." (Episode 2 - Outside the Two Whales Diner.)
* '''Chloe's pirate towel –''' Chloe had a pirate towel that she used when she was younger, and she was still using this same towel five years later when Max returned to Arcadia Bay.Max: "Chloe has had this damn dirty pirate towel since we were kids... Serious flashback." (Episode 3 - bathroom, Chloe's house.)
* '''William's BBQs –''' The small BBQ grill was still present in Chloe's backyard when Max and Chloe were kids, and they enjoyed burgers cooked on it by Chloe's dad.Max: "William used to grill awesome burgers for us. I wonder if he was the last one to use this..." (Episode 1 - BBQ grill, Chloe's backyard.)
* '''Joyce's Magazines –''' Joyce enjoyed mail-order catalogs, and a young Max obviously saw these around Chloe's home whenever she visited.Max: "Joyce always loved her mail-order catalogs of useless crap." (Episode 1 - Joyce's bedroom.)
* **Joyce and Vanessa (Shared Tastes) –** In 2013, it is mentioned that both Max and Chloe's mothers watch true crime shows, so it is possible that they also watched these when Max and Chloe were younger.Joyce: "I watch those awful true crime shows and it makes me ill if I think about Rachel ending up on one." (Episode 3 - Kitchen, Chloe's house.) . . . Max: "I felt like I was on one of those awful true-crime shows my mom binge-watches." (Episode 5 - *Journal*.)
* '''Max's Grandpa –''' Max mentions that her grandfather - either her [Ryan Caulfield](father.md)'s or her [Vanessa Caulfield](mother.md)'s father - has a garage that contains nuts and bolts.Max: "Nuts and bolts... like my grandpa's garage." (Episode 3 - [Samuel Taylor](samuel_taylor.md)'s [Custodial Room](custodial_room.md).)
* '''Chloe's dresser –''' When Max reconnects with Chloe five years after she had left for Seattle, she notices that some of Chloe's bedroom furniture she remembered from when they were kids is still present in the room. One such piece of furniture is the dresser that Chloe's dad had built for her.Max: "Chloe's dad built this dresser." (Episode 1 - Chloe's room.)

## Unused Material 
Some unused audio that refers to a younger Max and Chloe is present in earlier game files. It was either used in earlier editions of the game and since been removed, or it has always remained unused.
* **Backyard Mischief –** Joyce would yell at Max and Chloe from a living room window when they were playing in the backyard, possibly when they were up to mischief or doing something dangerous, or perhaps to call them in to eat food.Max: "How many times did Joyce yell at us from this window?" (Episode 1 - living room window, Chloe's house.)
* **Chloe Wanting a Dog –** Chloe had wanted a dog, and her mother had always wanted her to get a dog too.Joyce: "Oh, that's so cute. Chloe wanted a dog, too." (Episode 5 - Joyce to Frank - Pompidou Alive)/ "Oh, I'm so sorry... I always wanted Chloe to get a dog."(Episode 5 - Joyce to Frank - Pompidou Dead). *Note: Although originally intended, Pompidou does not die in the final version of the game. He is only injured if Max chooses to throw the bone into the road.* It even seems that Chloe would have made a good dog owner, from a comment intended to be spoken by [Frank Bowers](frank_bowers.md) five years later when Chloe is 19: ''"She'd be good with dogs. I know these things."'' It is unknown whether Chloe had wanted a dog after her cat, Bongo, had died or whether she had wanted a dog instead of or as well as having a cat.
