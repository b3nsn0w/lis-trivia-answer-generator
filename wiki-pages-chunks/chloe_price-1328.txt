**Chloe in "[Episode 2: Out of Time**, Out of Time](episode_2__out_of_time____out_of_time.md)"

**Chloe Elizabeth Price** (born March 11, 1994)[Media:Ep3-PrinOffice-ChloeFile.png](chloe_s_student_file.md) in "Chaos Theory" is the deuteragonist of *[Life is Strange](life_is_strange.md)*. She was the best friend of [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) before she moved to [Seattle](seattle.md), leaving Chloe in their hometown of [Arcadia Bay](arcadia_bay.md), Oregon. They rekindle their friendship during the events of the game. After Max left, Chloe became best friends with [Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md) before Rachel went missing. She is the daughter of [William Price](william_price.md) and [Joyce Price](joyce_price.md), and the step-daughter of [David Madsen](david_madsen.md).

Chloeâ€™s death may be the catalyst to unlocking [Max's Abilities](max_s_powers.md) and their emotional journey together is the main thrust of the story right through to its conclusion.

Chloe features again in the [Life is Strange (Franchise)](franchise.md) as the playable protagonist in *[Life is Strange: Before the Storm](before_the_storm.md)* (the prequel to the events of *Life is Strange*) and is most recently mentioned in the fifth episode of *[Life is Strange 2](life_is_strange_2.md)* and the bonus chapter of *[Life is Strange: True Colors](life_is_strange__true_colors.md)*.
