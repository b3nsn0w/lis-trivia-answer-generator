Here is a section of the wiki page for Chloe Price:

## Enemies 
*[David Madsen](david_madsen.md) - There is no evidence that Chloe's relationship with her step-father has been anything other than fragmented, particularly on her end. Chloe typically refers to him as "step-douche", "step-dildo" or "step-prick" and this disrespect only aggravates his locked-in military mindset. She is unsettled by his paranoia and is eager to find a way to incriminate him for his surveillance at Blackwell. However, David seems to want a loving relationship with Chloe despite her criminal activities and bad attitude; a birthday card from him to her suggests that he is proud to be a step-father and wants the same as Joyce; to be a family. Despite this, David has been shown to be physically and verbally abusive towards Chloe, such as slapping her and calling her a loser if Max does not take the blame for Chloe's marijuana.
*[Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md) - Chloe and Nathan despise each other. Chloe met Nathan at a bar when he was wasted, and tried to use his drunken state to con him out of money she could use to pay back Frank. But Nathan spiked her drink and took photos of her in her vulnerable state before she could escape his dormitory room. Deducing that Nathan deals drugs at Blackwell, she planned to blackmail him for money. Nathan grows angry at Chloe and threatens each other to stay away. After it becomes clear that Nathan is partially responsible for the drugging, photographing and death of Rachel Amber, Chloe is on the warpath and resolves to get revenge for her friend.
*[Frank Bowers](frank_bowers.md) - **(Determinant)** Chloe and Frank are at odds after she borrowed three thousand dollars from Frank without a way to pay him back. She hoped that Rachel could help her but she disappeared without warning. Frank threatens Chloe when she doesn't pay him back, but Chloe becomes more disgusted with Frank than scared when she sees him wearing Rachel's bracelet and eventually learns that the two had a relationship. When Max and Chloe visit Frank, depending on whether or not Max chooses to give Frank the money stolen from the handicap fund (as well as how they treat Frank), they may be on better terms after the encounter. Alternatively, Chloe may wound or even kill Frank (and his dog) if he tries to attack Max.
*[Mark Jefferson](mark_jefferson.md) - After first meeting him, Chloe originally remarked that Mark Jefferson was attractive and teased Max about Max's admiration for Mark. Max and Chloe were too intent on finding Nathan Prescott to avenge Rachel Amber's death that they both fell into Mark Jefferson's trap and Chloe was eventually killed by Jefferson. Max had to travel back in time through photos taken earlier to attempt to keep Chloe alive as well as to warn Chloe and David about Mark Jefferson. Chloe will ask Max to promise her to make Rachel Amber's killers pay if Max decides to sacrifice Chloe in the final episode.
*[Victoria Chase](victoria_chase.md) - Chloe appears to know of Victoria outside of Max's interactions with her. If Max mocks Victoria (and takes her picture), Chloe will call Victoria a skank and say "karma is a bitch", indicating that she was not on good terms with her. In Episode 4, Chloe is not surprised when Victoria wins the [Everyday Heroes Photo Contest](everyday_heroes_photo_contest.md) through means of blackmail.
