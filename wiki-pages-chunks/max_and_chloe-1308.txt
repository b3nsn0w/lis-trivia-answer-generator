Here is a section of the wiki page for Max and Chloe:

## Episode One - "[Episode 1: Awake](awake.md)" 
[File:Max and Chloe 28.png](left.md)
[Chloe Price (Before the Storm)](chloe.md) is deeply affected by the absence of [Maxine Caulfield (Before the Storm)](max.md) and this shows in her eager [Chloe's Messages](text_messages.md) and the [Chloe's Letters](diary_entries.md) she has been writing as though she is addressing Max directly. In the very first entry dated March 5, 2010, Chloe tells Max that they haven't talked in three monthsMax's last text message to Chloe was on November 28, 2009. Although Max texting Chloe does contradict the statement that Chloe makes in *Life is Strange: Season 1* when she tells Max, "You were happy to wait five years without a call, or even a text.", despite all her calls and texts. The tone of her diary is very much a deep loss and longing for her best friend to return to her. She uses this "Journal Max" as a sounding board for all of her life problems and life events.Just like in *Life is Strange: Season 1*, the diary is a game mechanic that is used to log player progress and choices. She talks to Max about her intense dislike of her [Joyce Price (Before the Storm)](mother.md)'s new boyfriend, [David Madsen (Before the Storm)](david.md). On April 4, 2010, she also discloses to "Journal Max" a feeling of sexual confusion over fantasizing about Pris from *Blade Runner* - a movie they enjoyed watching together as kids.

Chloe refers to Max in her diary as an "artsy motherfucker" who loves photography more than life itself and more than her. She blames Max's abandoning of her as teaching her the life lesson that she cannot rely on anyone. Chloe also says that the worst part of Max's habitual ignoring of her texts is that she knows that she still misses Max and would take her back in a heartbeat.

Chloe has two [Chloe's Dreams](dreams.md) that involve Max. Her first dream is a more pleasant memory where Max has written her a letter that she keeps in her diary. The letter reads:

{{Bigquote
|*Dear Chloe,*

''I have the best news -- I'm coming back to Arcadia Bay! My dad got a job at the Beacon, and we're moving back in like, a day. How crazy is that?!*

*I've missed you so much, Chloe. I found out the other day that all the letters I've been sending you have been lost in the mail. That's just so, so shitty. I'd never not write you. I'd never forget you. You're my best friend, and I've missed you so much.*

*Promise me the first thing we do when I get back is hit up the Two Whales for some of your mom's waffles. Then we're going to binge watch tv in bed and draw new comics about super hero alter egos of ourselves. Then I'm going to take glamour shots of your beautiful face so all the world can know how incredible you really are.*

*Can't wait!*

*Max.''}}

Max's text messages in this dream are of Max wondering where Chloe has disappeared to, showing that she cares about Chloe disappearing from her, if the shoe were on the other foot, so to speak.

Chloe's next dream is more of a nightmare that shows her diary opened to an illustration of Max hanging from a tree.Max's clothes in this illustration are identical to the clothes she wears in *Life is Strange: Season 1*'s Episode 1 ("Chrysalis") There are some disturbing text messages from Max in this dream that state she will see Chloe "real soon", when Chloe is dead. But if the player reads the messages according to the timestamp, (they are inverted), the messages will seem strangely premonitory and somewhat comforting.

Also of note in this episode is that we see Chloe using the same phone that she had decorated with Max two or more years ago (as seen in *Life is Strange: Season 1*'s Episode 3 if Max had opened one of Chloe's bedroom drawers). Other characters are using smartphones, so for Chloe to hang onto an old phone like this that is decorated with youthful stickers shows just how sentimental it is to her and how truly missed Max is.

## Episode Two - "[Episode 2: Brave New World](brave_new_world.md)" 
Just like she does in the first episode, Chloe continues to "communicate" with Max in her diary entries. During this episode, Chloe also comments that she thinks she is more jealous of Max than anything (in relation to Max having escaped Arcadia Bay). In a dream, Chloe receives text messages from Max that tell Chloe they cannot be friends anymore because Chloe got kicked out of Blackwell. Max also questions if they were ever friends. Also in the dream, her dead father, [William Price (Before the Storm)](william_price.md), warns her about getting drawn to fire and its blinding beauty (perhaps a reference to her new friendship with / attraction to [Rachel Amber (Before the Storm)](rachel_amber.md)) and tells her that, "Sometimes there's a greater beauty yet to come" (which may be a reference to Max returning to her in three years).

## Episode Three - "[Episode 3: Hell Is Empty](hell_is_empty.md)"
