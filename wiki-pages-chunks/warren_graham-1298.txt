Here is a section of the wiki page for Warren Graham:

## Animal Symbolism 
The animal connected to Warren the most is the cat since there are several references to the theory of Schrödinger's cat in his text messages or on his shirt in Episode 2.

The cat is known for being a great hunter using not just force, but a refined sense of timing in the moment of the attack. Those who have the cat as a spirit animal may be able to tackle issues with patience, confidence, observation and a good sense of timing in their actions. This aspect of the cat totem refers to Warren always being there in the right moment to protect Max from Nathan or to comfort her (for example, after Kate's suicide attempt), but also to him waiting for the right time to confess his feelings for Max but never finding the right time.

The cat totem symbolizes exploring areas in your life or aspects of yourself that you do not know well yet. It represents the balance between seeming opposites, such as inner and outer, action and rest, light and dark. It’s strongly symbolic of the connection with what usually hides in darkness or the unknown. This aspect of the cat totem refers to the contrast between Warren's good-natured and insecure character and his dark and violent offensive side that's hidden inside him but is shown when he's beating up Nathan violently and mercilessly, a side which Warren himself didn't know until then. The cat also represents courage and agility; the cat is always able to get back on its feet, as Warren does shortly after being beaten up by Nathan himself.

The cat totem furthermore is a source of inspiration to renew your perspective and have the courage to act or integrate it into your life. The cat spirit symbolizes the need to explore new ways to look at things. This aspect refers to his willingness to accept non-scientific explanations for what's happening at Arcadia Bay and to believe in Max's rewind ability despite his rationality and affection for science.http://www.spiritanimal.info/cat-spirit-animal/

## Inconsistencies 
{{Main|Inconsistencies (Life is Strange)}}
* Warren's age is 16, according to the date of birth on his Student Information Sheet in the principal's office, but the high school is specifically for seniors. There is the possibility that he has advanced a few grades due to his academic abilities. Some other students appear to have been attending Blackwell for a longer period than one year.
* It also seems contradictory that Max writes in her journal that Warren is "her age" since they are approximately one year and two months apart by age. It is possible that Max didn't know Warren's age at the time she wrote that in her diary.
* According to [http://lordtrinen.tumblr.com/post/165819141638/warren-grahams-confirmed-age-one-small-mystery this post], [Don't Nod](dontnod_entertainment.md) confirmed via email that Warren's date of birth is November 20, 1996 (age 16 in 2013) which is the same date displayed on his Student Information Sheet.

## Character Concept and Design 
According to Artistic Director [Michel Koch](michel_koch.md), Warren's character is inspired by {{Wiki|Xander Harris|Xander}} from *{{Wiki|Buffy the Vampire Slayer}} *who "has this kind of awkwardness in him and is always saying the wrong things, but he's a good guy". [http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/first-love-and-awkwardness-inside-the-mind-of-life-is-strange-co-director-michel-koch-423 First Love and Awkwardness: Inside the Mind of ‘Life Is Strange’ Co-Director Michel Koch] (August 4, 2015)

In the same interview, he revealed the intention behind the scene of Warren beating up Nathan:

{{Bigquote|"If you choose not to step in on the fight with Nathan, we start to see something a little different, a darker side of Warren. It's very violent and gets a bit out of control. It shows us that, even if we're good characters, we all have a side of us that can go out of control. Everyone has shades of grey, bits of darkness."}}
