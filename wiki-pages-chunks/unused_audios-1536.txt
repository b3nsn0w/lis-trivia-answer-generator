Here is a section of the wiki page for Unused Audios:

## Episode Four - "[Episode 4: Dark Room](dark_room.md)" 
* William's conversation with young Max and Chloe in 2008 as he leaves with his car keys: "These keys aren't as faithful as you and Max. Be right back. Maybe I'll have an early treat from Bean City... if the queen lets her squire have a mocha."This audio file was replaced in the current version of the game (v1.0.0.397609) with: ''"Don't blow it because tonight your mother promised to make us her world-famous salmon surprise with chocolate cake for dessert. Max, you'll be here too, right?"'' {{Headphones|fileWilliam-found_keys.ogg}} . . . "Watch out for Chloe while I'm gone, Max." {{Headphones|file# William-watch_out_for_chloe.ogg}} . . . "I will." {{Headphones|fileMax-affirmation.ogg}}
* Jefferson complimenting Chloe in front of the Prescott Dormitory: "With that ink you'd be a perfect model for skater clothes." - "Thanks. That'd be totally... bitchin'. Isn't that hobby talk there?" {{Headphones|file# SkaterClothes.ogg}}
* Nathan after fighting with Warren on the dormitory floor: "I saw it... *laugh* I saw it, the storm. Everybody's waiting for the storm. [...] *shouting* The storm is coming! Oh, you're all gonna die! I see you, I see all of you, and you're all gonna die!"This unused audio file indicates that it was planned to reveal that Nathan knew about the storm. That could also explain the hint in Principal Wells' office stating he would've tried to steal the Tobanga totem. One of the game directors later confirmed in an interview that it was thought to be in Episode 5, but was scrapped pre-release because it didn't make enough sense story-wise and there weren't enough hints to this before the final episode. Part of it was used in the trailer for Episode 4.

* Max giving instructions to Warren after the fight "What you can do is hole up in your room and find out if there is any more storm warnings" (instead of finding informations about Nathan's father). It was probably linked to the unused dialogue with Nathan warning them that the storm is coming. [File:Headphones.png](16px.md)
* Warren playing a video game on the toilet in the boys' dormitory: "Come on, baby..."[File:Headphones.png](16px.md) . . . "Gimme those points, freaky octopus..."[File:Headphones.png](16px.md) . . . "One more match and you’re mine..."[File:Headphones.png](16px.md) . . . "Level up, bitch!"[File:Headphones.png](16px.md)
** Max listening to Warren playing the video game on the toilet: "When you gotta play, you gotta play... Remind me not to use that guy's phone."[File:Headphones.png](16px.md)
** Max looking at the heavily graffitied door to the boys' toilets: "Even if my bladder was on fire, I would never enter that door. Ever." [File:Headphones.png](16px.md)
** Warren saying Max's name in surprise (perhaps upon seeing her inside the boys' dorms): "Max?" [File:Headphones.png](16px.md)
* Chloe after killing Frank on the beach: "All I know is that, I committed a murder. Max, I actually killed somebody. I'm sorry Max. I destroy everything I touch. You should just bail on me now."Max: "Oh God, this is terrible. I shouldn't have let this happen. Now Chloe could actually go to jail. She'll understand that you were saving the life of a friend." "I'm glad you're back on my team, Chloe. I can't do this without you. You committed self-defense. Rachel would never let Frank attack you. We have to focus on Rachel right now. Time is the one thing we actually don't have anymore."Chloe: "Sigh. Uh okay, you're right. Focus on Rachel. It's all about Rachel now. Okay, what's wrong? What's right? Maybe you forgot I just fucking killed Frank Bowers. I killed a man who loved Rachel... and who Rachel loved. Is that how I help her? I can't believe I killed Frank. He was alive... and then he was dead... Because of me... and Rachel loved him... maybe more than me. So this is how I help her? Oh God. Max, I'm going to go to the police after we find Rachel... I can't live with keeping this a secret. I'm... I don't want to be a teenage fugitive on the run. And dude, I swear I won't even mention you. Okay? This is all me. What's going to happen to me now? Please, please, please let us find Rachel. I can't believe this is happening. I can't. Frank tried to kill you what else could I do?" [File:Headphones.png](16px.md)
* It was apparently possible for Chloe to die at the end of the confrontation with Frank on the beach, as several unused audio files named "Chloedead" seem to indicate. (Frank)"You like having a gun pointed at you, bitch?Huh?" / (Chloe)"No, she doesn't, asshole!" / (Frank)"Dumbass" / (Max)"Chloe!"{{Headphones|file# Chloedead.ogg‎}}
* Inner thought from Max while on the beach: "We're getting so close to Rachel Amber, just as Arcadia Bay is on the edge of disaster."*{{Headphones|fileVO_E4_4A.STM_80~Act_E4_4A_Beach_ScriptedParkingLot_Max_020.ogg‎}}*
* Max in the junkyard when realizing who shot Chloe (instead of remaining silent while staring at Jefferson): "You..." [File:Headphones.png](16px.md)
* Max in the [Dark Room
