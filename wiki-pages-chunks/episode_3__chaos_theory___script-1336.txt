Here is a section of the wiki page for Episode 3: Chaos Theory - Script:

## **Hallway** 
*Max and Chloe enter the hallway. Max turns on the flashlight on her phone.''

**Max:** Chloe the Keymaster.

**Chloe:** You know it.

**Max:** Dude, I don't know about this...we're both already in SO much trouble...

(Max took the blame for Chloe / Max came out of hiding to intervene)(Max took the blame for Chloe / Max came out of hiding to intervene)**Chloe:** Not to mention the weed you brought into my room. Joking.

|-|(Max blamed Chloe / Max stayed hidden)# (Max blamed Chloe / Max stayed hidden)**Chloe:** You can always let me get busted like you did with the weed.

**Max:** I'm serious. We're not kids anymore. We're breaking and entering...

**Chloe:** If I have a key, how can it be breaking? They can't charge us for just entering!

**Max:** I'm serious. We could go to jail...

(David is on leave)(David is on leave)**Chloe:** Not when Blackwell's ex-head of security is at home crying in his basement bunker...

|-|(David isn't on leave)# (David isn't on leave)**Chloe:** Not if I'm related to the head of Blackwell security. Step-shit will not want me in the hands of the local police...

**Chloe:** So we better find out what's in the principal's office first. You can rewind if we get caught, right? You have mad powers, Max.

*Chloe begins unlocking the door.*

(Saved Kate)(Saved Kate)**Max:** But my powers didn't save Kate... Maybe I did on my own...

|-|(Didn't save Kate)# (Didn't save Kate)**Max:** Tell that to Kate...

*Chloe unlocks the door and enters the room inside.*

**Chloe:** Come on. One more door and our work here is done.

*Max follows Chloe into the room. Chloe is attempting to unlock the second door.*

**Conversation with Chloe**

**Chloe:** That's it! *[looks down at the keys in her hand]* What the fuck? The security officer should have the key to the principal's office!

**Max:** He's hiding shit. Like EVERYBODY here.

**Chloe:** Well, now we definitely have to get this door open. Believe it or not, I know a little about lock-picking...thanks to Frank. *[crouches down near the door]* I might as well test out my thief skill...

*Chloe begins attempting to pick the lock on the door.*

**Max:** Go for it. We're already in this deep...

**Chloe:** *[turns toward Max]* Well, you could look for the key...just in case.

**Max:** Why, yes, I could...

''Max explores the surroundings but can't find the key to the office.''

**Max:** No key for thee... We have to find another way in.

**Chloe:** Guess I didn't spend enough time with Frank... But I'll use my DIY lock-pick tools while you come up with a better plan.

**Max:** My plan has a name...

*Max calls Warren on her cell phone.*

**Max:** Hey, Warren, you busy? *[Warren speaks inaudibly]* Just bubble-hearth, you'll be okay. Listen, I need your physics expertise, stat. Without naming names, if somebody had access to the art and science labs and wanted to construct a device that would, say, open a locked door, would you maybe kinda know how? *[Warren speaks inaudibly]* Huh? No...I'm just asking for fun. *[Warren speaks inaudibly]* Thanks, Science Guy. *[Warren speaks inaudibly]* Uh, n-no, no, no, stay. We need you as backup. Just send the text instructions NOW. *[Warren speaks inaudibly]*

(Max accepted Warren's invitation)(Max accepted Warren's invitation)**Max:** Yes, I'm still ALL-IN to "Go Ape" with you at the drive-in... Thanks for the help.

|-|(Max declined Warren's invitation)# (Max declined Warren's invitation)**Max:** I'm sorry, I'm just not sure about a movie night right now. Don't hate me... And thanks for the help.

*Max hangs up.*

**Chloe:** This sucks ass! Goddamn door! *[punches the door]*

**Max:** Try not to wake up everybody at Blackwell!

*Max receives a text message from Warren with instructions.*

**Chloe:** Sorry, Max, I got nothin'. What about your plan?

**Max:** I'm gonna go put it together. Can you stay here and not get caught?

**Chloe:** I might get on the other side of that door before you, Lupin.

**Max:** The race is ON. See you soon.

*Max and Warren text each other about the instructions for building a pipe bomb. Max leaves the room to gather the four objects: sugar, a soda can, duct tape, and sodium chlorate.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Warren is such a classic nerd. Let's see if I can find those items...

*Max approaches the vending machine, inserting a coin and pressing the button for soda.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Release the kra-can!

*The soda can falls to the bottom slot and Max takes it.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* It's all mine anyway...

**Max:** *(thinking) [after getting first item]* Only three more items to go!

*Max enters the science lab.*
