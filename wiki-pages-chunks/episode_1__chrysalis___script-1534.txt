blasting that punk shit?

**Chloe:** Dude, the music's not even on! Asshole.

**David:** I'm coming up, we need to talk!

**Chloe:** No fucking way! *(to Max)* You need to hide. Now! My stepdad will kill me if he finds you here!

*Chloe leans against the door.*

**David:** Chloe, what's going on? Open the door, please.

**Chloe:** *(to David)* Chill, I'm changing, is that okay? *(to Max, whispering)* Max, find a place to hide, NOW!

**David:** Chloe... What are you doing?

**Chloe:** I'm coming!

**David:** Chloe, you're stalling.

**Chloe:** I'm changing! Gimme a minute!

**David:** Don't get smart, just let me in. Now. Please.

**Chloe:** One second...my bra is stuck.

**David:** I'm not screwing around, soldier. Chloe. Open this door. I'm giving you exactly three seconds to open the door. One...two...three...

**Chloe:** Shit.

''David enters Chloe's room.''

**David:** What's going on in here? Why is she here?

**Chloe:** None of your business.

**David:** I don't like strangers here.

**Chloe:** Stop freaking, she's not a stranger. This is my friend.

**David:** Great, another one of your "friends".

**David:** I ordered you never to go through my files. You obviously have.

**Chloe:** I didn’t touch your files, David. I could care less about your files.

**David:** You care about starting shit, Chloe. And it’s getting old.

**David:** One of my guns is missing. Did you take it?

**Chloe:** Oh, God, I didn't take your stupid gun. You do know I believe in gun control?

**David:** Wait, is that grass? You've been toking up again in here?

**Chloe:** Oh yeah, guns, weed... You're trippin' balls.

**David:** I'm sick of your disrespect! Tell me the truth, that's an order!

**Chloe:** It's not my pot, it's from Max!

**David:** Is this true?

**Max:** No way. It's not mine.

**David:** Of course not. I'm sure Chloe gets all the best shit, right? I bet she gave you "good friend" rates...

**Chloe:** Why don't you get off my crack? Stop taking your war rage out on high school girls.

**David:** You haven't seen rage, you little—

**Chloe:** Fuck you, pig.

*David slaps Chloe.*

**David:** I... Listen, you asked for that. You know exactly what you're doing.

**David:** For your own good, you should stay away from Chloe. She's a loser and she'll only drag you down. Stick to doing your homework.

**Chloe:** Listen, David. I have proof you got all up in Kate Marsh's face today. Surveillance proof.

**David:** What are you talking about?

**Chloe:** You know what I'm talking about.

**David:** I can already tell from today that you're trouble, Max. I hope this doesn't affect your status at Blackwell. Don't ever come back here.

**Chloe:** Listen, dipshit, if you ever lay a hand on me again, I'll have your ass in jail. Then you can guard yourself all night...

**David:** You're the ones who'll end up in jail.

**David:** You only think you're tough and clever. This too shall pass... Now, clean this pigsty up.

*David leaves the room.*

**Max:** I'm sorry, Chloe... I didn't know what to do...

**Chloe:** Whatever. Everybody bails on me. Even my "best friend" Max... Don't you? I'm so done with everyone in this town... I wish I hadn't even seen you. As if you care. Color me outta here...

*Chloe gets up and leaves through the window.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* David was such a mean bastard to Chloe... What if I had stepped up to help?

*Max leaves through the window.*

**Max:** Uh, yeah. My pot...

**David:** So you're bringing drugs into my home. How about if I call the police? That would screw up your spotless Blackwell record... You do seem to get around..."Max". I'm sick of you losers dragging Chloe down.

**David:** You're on a roll today. Between the fire alarm and now this... You don't have anything smart to say now? Do you? Huh?

**Chloe:** Get the hell away from her! I have proof you hassled Kate Marsh today!

**David:** What? What are you talking about?

**Chloe:** I have surveillance proof. Now please leave us alone.

**David:** Okay, Chloe. You know everything. And Max, if I find you here again... It will be the last time.
