reveal the truth about Chloe.

Then, she exits the Dark Room and calls [Warren Graham](warren_graham.md) to ask for the [Media:warren-max-pola.png](photo.md) he took at the End of the World Party, as it is the only way of traveling back in time. Using Jefferson's car to get to the [Two Whales Diner](two_whales_diner.md) where Warren is hiding, Max has to walk around the debris and may help various people along the way. One of the challenges is to use a fuse box to get past a fire blocking the way. Max then has to prevent another fire from reaching the diner using sand. When she is finally inside, she finds out that Warren is there along with [Joyce Price](joyce_price.md) and [Frank Bowers](frank_bowers.md). They talk for a while, and before focusing on the photo, Max has the option to hug or kiss Warren, or not to show him any affection at all.

Max focuses on the photo and returns to the time before she and Chloe entered the [Vortex Club](vortex_club.md) party. She then has to convince Chloe to return to [Madsen Household](her_house.md) rather than go on to find Nathan. The only way to do that is to be honest: Max has to tell Chloe in detail what she went through and what a terrible [Choices and Consequences](choice.md) she had to make, after which Chloe will believe her, they will warn David about Jefferson and stay at Chloe's house till the storm is about to strike.

Max wakes up at the [beach](beach.md) and has a conversation with Chloe about their friendship. As they move on to the [lighthouse](lighthouse.md) to save themselves from the approaching tornado, Max loses consciousness and falls into a disturbing [Max's Nightmare](nightmare.md).

**Art Class**:Â Max sits through the same lecture from the beginning of the game, believing she is in a time loop. Then the room is suddenly empty and Max gets up. As she is about to exit, Jefferson appears and calls her. Max is forced into a conversation with him, in which they very creepily discuss the events that happened in the Dark Room and Max is forced to give an agreeable answer.

After the conversation, he disappears and Max can leave the room. She then finds herself, not in the corridor of Blackwell, but in the hallway of the girl's side of the [Prescott Dormitory](prescott_dormitory.md).

**Dormitory Hall**: Max is confronted with walking down the hallway of the Dormitory towards Kate Marsh. When Max talks to her, she is abusive and blames Max for her suicide attempt. She will open her dorm room door and fall through it into the light. As it closes behind her, Max can follow. She ends up once again in the dormitory hallway. This time however, a key with a room number is visible and may be picked up on a bench by the shower room door. By looking at the number at each door and by referring to the dormitory map directory, the room number on the key is referring to [Dana Ward](dana.md)'s room. After opening [Dana's Room](dana_s_room.md), she goes through and again finds herself at the entrance to the hallway.

This time, she is dressed in Rachel Amber's clothes and the dormitory map directory will have some changes to some of the room occupants including Rachel Amber being listed in one of the rooms. Max must enter through the first doorway on the left in order to progress, as this is where Rachel stayed when she was at Blackwell. Max finds herself transformed into Victoria this time, and enters through Victoria's bedroom door to move on. One last time, she finds herself at the beginning of the hallways which are now covered in polaroids, while all the slates read "LOOK AT ME: I AM MAX SELFIE!". Max heads to her own room and finally enters it to appear in the hallway of Blackwell Academy.

**Blackwell Academy Hallway**: Max finds herself in the same situation she was in after she exited Jefferson's classroom on Monday, except this time everything is reversed, including Max's speech and the movement of the characters. Max puts on her earphones and has to walk to the bathroom again, while listening to a reversed version of "[To All of You](to_all_of_you.md)".

**Maze**: Upon entering the bathroom, Max finds herself in a dream-like atmosphere, with floating debris and darkened backdrops. With the lighthouse in the far off distance, she lands in a maze made up of walls with photographs from the Dark Room. Jefferson patrols the scene with a flashlight, attempting to catch her. Escaping Jefferson, she makes her way to a section with the Blackwell founder statue in the centre, surrounded by gallery boards of Dark Room photos, with the voice of Ray Wells booming over loudspeakers. Max must avoid being spotted by the statue's light source, hiding behind the billboards. This leads her to a section filled with Blackwell school lockers. Warren, Principal Wells, Samuel, Nathan and David Madsen patrol the spaces between the lockers, chiding at Max, calling for her to come out, and saying negative things about her.

If she makes it past here, Max will end up in a nightmare version of the American Rust Junkyard. Jefferson, Nathan and Frank patrol here, looking for Max and making hurtful comments and observations. Here, Max can collect five bottles in order to line them up for an optional photo. There is also the opportunity for a moment of peace, with a "sit" option beside the [hideout](hideout.md) Chloe and Rachel inhabited. After making her way through here, Max heads towards the bench beside the lighthouse and sits.

The following nightmare scenes, '''Chloe's House** and **Dark Room''', are only cutscenes and do not require any action from the player.

Max is eventually transported into the bathroom of the Two Whales Diner, and needs a digicode to get out. The correct combination is
