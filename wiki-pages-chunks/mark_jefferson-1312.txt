Here is a section of the wiki page for Mark Jefferson:

## Background 
[File:Lifeisstrange-2015-02-03-19-12-43-41.jpg](thumb.md)
Jefferson was born in [Arcadia Bay](arcadia_bay.md) and at some point in his life, developed an interest in art and photography as a student. He attended the American Academy of Art in Chicago. Eventually, Jefferson's work would become widely recognized during the 90's and this would lead to him becoming a well-established photographer. Though he has a diverse portfolio, his most popular work is specifically focused on black and white portrait photography involving female models in suggestive positions. His shots have been published on front covers of various fashion magazines and also has his own book published on taking the perfect photograph.

It appears that Jefferson has very strict opinions on art and photography and is prepared to criticize other artists' views and opinions on specific art styles, for example, his early comments on the famous photographer Diane Arbus. He believes strongly in the beauty and innocence that art should maintain, such that he believes true beauty is almost impossible to obtain "without a beat".

In the late 2000s, Jefferson took a well-publicized detour into teaching around the country, inevitably ending up in a permanent position at Blackwell Academy. When he was offered a teaching position at Blackwell Academy back in Arcadia Bay, Jefferson accepted this position as art lecturer. This would lead to a huge increase in popularity of Blackwell as numerous students applied from around the country just to get a place on Mr. Jefferson's art course including Victoria Chase as well as Max Caulfield who was successful. Much of his work is displayed around the Blackwell campus, particularly at the front of the building in large-scale, outdoor frames. However, Jefferson used his position as an art teacher to find suitable models for his secret illegal photography he pursued in the [Dark Room (Location)](dark_room.md), a bunker in the possession of the Prescott family.[File:Dark room.jpg](left.md)
It's unknown when exactly Jefferson became involved with the Prescotts. Upon becoming a teacher at Blackwell academy, he acted as a mentor to Nathan. The Prescotts allowed him complete access to the bunker and dark room. Unbeknownst to them, Jefferson was manipulating Nathan.

## Episode One - "[Episode 1: Chrysalis](chrysalis.md)" 
[File:Mr. Jefferson talking with Max and Victoria.jpg](left.md)
Max initially snaps out of her vision in the middle of Jefferson's photography class. Jefferson wants his students to each submit a photo for the "Everyday Heroes" contest. Max tries to avoid it, but he tells her she needs the courage to share her work. Max can rewind several times in order to impress Jefferson; specifically to steal Victoria's answer about the Daguerreian Process, and to quote John Lennon."Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans."

After some exploration in the classroom, we can see that he took a picture of his students in the first week of the semester as well as his photos placed on the front cover of fashion magazines, his highly expensive photography equipment, and various art/photography books.

Upon speaking with [Stella Hill](stella_hill.md), Max learns of a rumor that Mark had sex with [Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md) before she went missing.

As it starts to snow at the end of the episode, Mr. Jefferson is shown working on his laptop inside his empty classroom. He notices the snow from the classroom windows and slowly looks up to witness the event.

## Episode Two - "[Episode 2: Out of Time](out_of_time.md)" 
[File:Kate and Mr. Jefferson.jpg](thumb.md)
He is seen talking to Kate about her problems, dismissing her worries and quoting Hamlet, "perhaps she doth protest too much". She asks for help, but becomes frustrated and leaves the school. His insensitivity contributes to her suicide attempt. When Max makes a comparison between Kate and Rachel Amber, Mr. Jefferson remarks that "Rachel was nothing like Kate" and adds that he misses her. As Max tries to find out more about the conversation, Jefferson moves away to take a phone call. He then commences class with another lecture about black and white photography but is interrupted by the commotion surrounding Kate at the [Prescott Dormitory](prescott_dormitory.md).

In Principal Wells' office after the incident with Kate, Max can choose to blame Jefferson for the incident. Wells makes it clear that he should have been more attuned to the needs of his students.

 Blame Jefferson#  Blame Jefferson If Max blames Jefferson for not being attuned to his student's needs and being dismissive of her, Wells suspends Jefferson from attending the "Everyday Heroes" Contest, saying that he is no longer a good representative for the school after not showing enough consideration towards his students; particularly due to knowing Kate well after she helped him after class occasionally. 
|-|Blame either Nathan or DavidBlame either Nathan or David Jefferson takes no blame and is sent on his way from the office. 

At the end of the episode, Wells and Jefferson can be seen arguing as Jefferson leaves the Parking Lot in his car.

## Episode Three - "[Episode 3: Chaos Theory](chaos_theory.md)" 

|-|If Max Blames Jefferson# If Max Blames Jefferson
If Mr. Jefferson is suspended for his involvement in Kate's successful or attempted suicide, a social media page supporting Jefferson is set up by his students. Victoria comments on the page, saying, "The major reason I came to Blackwell was Mark Jefferson".
[File:Victoria flirts with Mr. Jefferson.jpg](thumb.md)Near the beginning of the episode, Max and Chloe overhear Jefferson talking with Victoria. He was helping her review her portfolio after school hours. She flirts with him and attempts to blackmail him into picking her photo for the "Everyday Heroes" Contest. He refuses her explicit attempts at flirting, and disciplines her, saying she should return to her dormitory. It seems as though he has no interest in pursuing anything with her, and takes a professional approach.
