'''Warren's Flash Dâ€‹rive''' appears in [Episode 1: Chrysalis](episode_1__chrysalis.md). One of the first [Objectives (Life is Strange)](objectives.md) of [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) is to bring it back to [Warren Graham](warren_graham.md) after having borrowed it on October 3.Max states in [Max's Diary](her_diary.md) that it hasn't been a full week since she borrowed the flash drive, and Warren sends Max a message reminding her to check NEKromantik on his flash drive that day.

##  Episode One - "[Episode 1: Chrysalis](chrysalis.md)" 
[File:Dana-flashdrivenote.png](thumb.md) Shortly after exiting the [Blackwell Academy](blackwell_academy.md) building, Max receives a [Max's Messages](message.md) from Warren asking for his flash drive to be returned. She heads to [Max's Room](her_dorm_room.md) and finds out that [Dana Ward](dana_ward.md) has borrowed the drive to entertain herself while studying. Max then has to sort out the drama between [Juliet Watson](juliet_watson.md) and Dana to finally get to [Dana's Room](dana_s_room.md) and grab the flash drive. She can also plug it into [Dana's Computer](dana_s_computer.md) (or [Max's Computer](her_own.md)) to check its contents. After returning the drive to Warren on the [Blackwell Parking Lot](blackwell_parking_lot.md), Max and Warren talk about the various films contained on it.

##  Trivia 
*After grabbing the flash, Max says: "Must protect my precious, so Max never has to chase it down again." This is a [References (Life is Strange)](reference.md) to "[w:c:lotr](_the_lord_of_the_rings_.md)".
*Warren's flash drive has colored sides and looks like three cubes connected together. This might be a reference to the ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's_Cube Rubik's Cube].''
*[File:ComputerScreen Chloe-flashdrive.png](thumb.md) During the investigation in [Chloe's Room](chloe_s_room.md) in "[Episode 4: Dark Room](dark_room.md)," the background screen on [Chloe's Computer](chloe_s_laptop.md) is the screen previously seen in Episode 1 that shows the contents of Warren's flash drive; however, it is now minus the MAX folder and has a green border. This appears to be a reused and modified asset.
