Here is a section of the wiki page for Reddit AMA (Dayeanne Hutton):

Burch or any other voice actors? Like if you were on "Hey Ash, Watcha Playin?" would be awesome. If the episode 5 stream of LiS on Square Enix had both you, Ashly, and Hannah, I would die of joy... 5. Did you play Before the Storm, and if you did what did you think of it? And if you didn't, would you consider streaming it? or at least farewell 6. In an earlier stream of episode 2, you said you were looking into the stuff for the LiS-based tv show. Any progress? 7. (This one is for a friend) "What did you feel like when Kate died, and what did you feel like when Kate survived? Also how can the whole thing with Kate can apply to your life or anyone else's life?"

I know I asked a lot, but I just had a lot to say and I have to try and sneak this in during lunch. So thanks if you read this, and may your day be as pure as Kate and her bun!

I love that comic! Thank you! And hello to Alonzo!

    I don't know if KATE would actually be down for Marshfield lol but I like it!
    I honestly think she died :(
    She kind of made me sad that she was always sad, I worried people would think she came off whiney. I'm glad she doesn't though, that makes me very happy!
    I would love too! Unfortunately, I don't actually know Ashly, but it would be amazing to collab with her on something!
    I have played it (though not the farewell episode yet!) I liked it, it really helped me to understand Chloe better.
    I don't think there is anymore information out there yet
    I haven't ever played where Kate died because thats too weird and sad for me haha I'm very happy and relieved when I save her! I think the whole thing with Kate can let us know that we all need to be more aware of mental health and take it more seriously. I think it should show us we need to learn how to deal with these issues instead of brushing them off, or telling depressed people to "get over it". Awareness is a good first step!

Hi Dayeanne Hutton. I wanted to say awesome job voicing Kate Marsh. What was it like voicing her?

**dayebraham_lincoln**

There were no lasting effects, as the recording actually went by so quickly. I am very glad that the character has helped so many people; I agree that mental health awareness is too often overlooked. I am honored to be involved with a game that let people know they aren't alone.

I've got some questions about the game itself:

First off, have you played through LiS? If you have, what was your reaction to some of the more major plot points?

Did you ever rewind and second guess the decisions you made?

And lastly, were you able to save Kate on the rooftop, and what was your reaction to the result you got? Do you think you would have done differently if you didn't already record the voice lines for Kate?

Thanks for doing this AMA, it's really awesome of you!

**dayebraham_lincoln**

Yes! I played through LiS on my Twitch channel and the VODs are on my YouTube! I was shocked by some of the things I didn't already know about, so much heavy and dark content. It's been a while, but I'm sure I used rewind due to second guessing a few times. I DID save Kate which was a very stressful time for me haha but I do think I had an advantage since I read through all the lines when recording. Unfortunately, theres a very good chance I would have failed if I didn't record the lines.

1) Have you played BtS, and do you have your own theories for what happens to Rachel and Chloe in the 3 years after BtS?

2) Has anyone recognized you from your role out in public?

3) If you could have any superpower, what would it be?

4) Have you ever read any of the fan-fiction that's been created around the franchise?

5) What's your favorite video game, and why?

6) What was it like recording lines for multiple characters? Was the situation such that you'd have to do a Kate line one second and a Juliet one the next?

7) The franchise incorporates heavy themes such as school shootings, income inequality, depression, online bullying, single parent households, drug addiction, LGBT representation, rural economic decline, etc. In Life is Strange 2, are there any themes or social issues you would like to see explored that didn't get as much visibility in the first game and prequel?

#I have, all on my Twitch channel! I still need to play the Farewell episode, but I'm going to! I haven't thought about it TOO much honestly, I just figured they kept hanging out and getting into trouble and dealing with the information discovered in BtS
#mmmm for LiS, no I don't think so!
#I wanna apparate and not have to ever drive in traffic again!
#I haven't! I know it's out there :)
#You know, I LOVE me some classic Super Mario Bros. on the NES. I grew up playing it and have always loved it!
