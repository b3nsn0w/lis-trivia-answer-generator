Here is a section of the wiki page for Episode 5: Polarized - Walkthrough:

highlighted by the key moments in the week shared between her and Chloe. She has to navigate the path to the lighthouse once again to finally end the nightmare.

Max falls on the ground and finds out she is at the lighthouse with Chloe. A cutscene plays out, during which Max realizes that it was her power what created the storm, and the only way to stop it is to let Chloe die. Chloe gives her the photo of the [Blue Butterfly](blue_butterfly.md), and Max is faced with the most difficult choice in her life: either to sacrifice Chloe and save the population of Arcadia Bay, or sacrifice the town to save Chloe. Independent of the player's choice, the rest of the game is a cutscene which doesn't require any interaction.

[File:Ep5.JPG](centre.md)

After the events of the [Episode 4: Dark Room](previous_episode.md), [Maxine Caulfield](max.md) finds herself again in the [Dark Room (Location)](dark_room.md), tied to a chair. If you warned [Victoria Chase](victoria_chase.md) at the [End of the World Party](end_of_the_world_party.md), she will be lying dosed on the floor next to Max. There will be a trolley with lots of things, like syringes, photos, and water. First, detach your right feet, and pull it to you. After focusing on the photo, Max will wake up with hands tied, lying on the floor, with [Mark Jefferson](jefferson.md) taking pictures of her. He is angry because she moves too much, and will prepare another dose to calm her. Max kicks the trolley, and spills water on the photos he took, causing him to take others. The focus ends, and she is back again. Now, there are other photos due to what she did. In one of them, she is conscious. Max focuses on it, and you'll have a dialogue with Jefferson, where he will explain why he's doing this, among with [Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md)'s involvement and Rachel's death. While he is going to develop the shots in the computer, Max catches sight of her diary. Max rewinds time and asks Jefferson about it. He says that Max's selfies are waste of talent, and will throw the open diary right in front of Max in the chair. Focus on it, and you'll be back to the [Photography Lab](art_class.md) in [Episode 1: Chrysalis](episode_1.md).

At this point, Jefferson has no idea that she is aware of the Dark Room. Max, who has lived an entire week, can comfort [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md), making sure she will not attempt suicide, and confront Victoria about Kate's video. Max texts [David Madsen](david_madsen.md) (you'll need to search for his number in [Blackwell Academy](blackwell.md)'s Phone List, inside Max's bag), telling him everything about Jefferson, [Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md), and the Dark Room, and delete the message from her phone right after sending it, for security purposes. Then, she turns in her photo-memorial selfie for the [Everyday Heroes Contest](everyday_heroes_contest.md), to *make it easy *to *capture *Jefferson. When the focus closes, a slideshow of pictures shows all the original events being rewritten. The Dark Room is invaded by David and the police, Jefferson is arrested in school, the police discover Rachel's body in the Junkyard, and Max wins the contest. The last picture shows her with [Chloe Price](chloe_price.md), alive, in [Max's Room](her_room.md) at Blackwell.

Max wakes up inside a [plane](plane.md) flying to San Francisco, with [Raymond Wells](principal_wells.md) sleeping in the seat next to her. Looking at the blur outside of the window, she realizes that she is still in a focus between realities. Due to the many photo-jumps in a short space of time, she has a nosebleed similar to [Episode 2: Out of Time](episode_2.md), when she rewinded too much in the shooting session with Chloe and by freezing time trying to save Kate. Principal Wells wakes up and they talk about the week's events, after which the focus ends and Max finds herself in the [Zeitgeist Gallery](zeitgeist_gallery.md).

Principal Wells will have a short conversation with Max before moving on to eat caviar. Max may talk to the various people inside the gallery, but her main objective is to look at her winning photo on the second floor. Afterwards, she will have a vision of the storm and will hear Chloe calling for help. Max calls Chloe and realizes that the storm is still coming towards [Arcadia Bay](arcadia_bay.md). She then has to focus on the photo once more, and may be interrupted by people wanting to ask questions. Returning to the day the photo was taken, she tears it in half, and keeps the pieces in her diary.

Max is suddenly transported back to the Dark Room, and is restrained once again. Jefferson had asked her a question which she answers in an insulting way. Max gets a nosebleed once again, and as Jefferson moves on to give her an overdose, David enters the Dark Room and a fight breaks out between the two. Jefferson overpowers David, and Max has to rewind to the point when she was still talking with Jefferson and asks for a last request. The only meaningful option is to ask for a glass of water, because Jefferson pulls the trolley closer to Max. After David enters, Max has to first warn him about the tripod, then push the trolley to give David time to get up. Jefferson runs to grab his gun, and Max has to pull the light cable to create a distraction (this will only be available after interacting with another object in the room and rewinding). David finally knocks Jefferson out, ties him and frees Max. Max finds out Jefferson burned her diary and moves on to save Chloe, but has a conversation with David beforehand. David apologizes for everything he has done and asks where Chloe is. Max may or may not
