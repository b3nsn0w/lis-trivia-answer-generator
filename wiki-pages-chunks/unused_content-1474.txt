## Jefferson's Car 
This location was cut from the game, but it hints at there having been a different ending for Episode 4. Jefferson was driving his car with Max as a passenger, and they were talking about Nathan. It is possible that the destination was the junkyard, since Jefferson was already aware of Max knowing too much and was intending to kill Chloe and drug Max by offering to drive them to the junkyard.

## Samuel's Room 
There also is unused concept art of locations that aren't explorable in the game, for example of [Samuel Taylor](samuel_taylor.md)'s janitor room.

## Unused Scenes 
The following concept art sketches shows a scene that likely was planned early on for the game but was not adapted into it.

There was a planned hospital scene for "[Episode 5: Polarized](polarized.md)" which was meant to happen between David saving Max in the [Dark Room (Location)](dark_room.md) and the scene at the [Two Whales Diner](diner.md) during the storm. In this quick scene, David would have brought Max to the [hospital](hospital.md) after freeing her from the Dark Room, but Max would have escaped to go get the photo from Warren. It was stated by [Michel Koch](michel_koch.md) that they scrapped this scene because it "didn't add much to the story, and they preferred to focus their energy on more dialog and time between Max and Chloe after."[https://twitter.com/DONTNOD_Michel/status/691031104506167296 Twitter post by Michel Koch]

In the third episode, after being dropped off by Chloe at Blackwell Academy, Max is then directly seen in her room. In the trailer for this episode, Max can be seen wandering around the main campus, likely headed for her dorms.

## Unused Endings 
During development, Dontnod had considered a "[Hospital Ending](hospital_ending.md)", an alternative version of the "Sacrifice Chloe" ending, in which Chloe Price would have fallen into a coma instead of being killed. The scene would have shown Max Caulfield waking up in the hospital next to Chloe's hospital bed instead of attending Chloe's funeral.

## Unused Outcomes 
Unused audio files and animations indicate that it was possible for [Chloe Price](chloe.md) to die in three different ways at the end of the confrontation with Frank on the beach in Episode 4 while trying to protect Max.

The following are [Media:Chloedead.ogg](unused_audio_files.md) named "Chloedead":

: **Frank:** "You like having a gun pointed at you, bitch? Huh?" 
: **Chloe:** "No, she doesn't, asshole!"
: **Frank:** "Dumbass."
: **Max:** "Chloe!"

The following are unused animations:
* The first one is named "A_E4_4A_Beach_ChloeDead_Chloe_MF" and shows Chloe rapidly moving backwards before being shot in the stomach and falling to the ground.
* The second one is named "A_E4_4A_Beach_ChloeDeadV2_Chloe_MF" and shows Chloe holding a gun and firing it before being shot and falling to the ground.
* The third one is named "A_E4_4A_Beach_ChloeDeadV3_Chloe_MF" and shows Chloe drawing a gun from behind her back and being shot before she can aim. Chloe then falls to the ground.
