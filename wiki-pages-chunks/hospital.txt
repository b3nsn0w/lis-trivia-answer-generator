##  Trivia 
{{Main|Hospital Ending}}
*There was an [Hospital Ending](alternate_ending.md) planned in the early stages of development in which [Chloe Price](chloe_price.md) would have ended up in a coma. As evident from a [Media:Hospital Room Concept Art by Gary Jamroz-Palma.jpg](piece_of_concept_art.md), Max would have visited Chloe at the hospital.
*The hospital location was originally designed for the above-mentioned alternate ending, and the scene with Kate after she survived her suicide attempt was only added later on because the fans liked Kate so much.
*It is unknown what the outside of the hospital looks like.
