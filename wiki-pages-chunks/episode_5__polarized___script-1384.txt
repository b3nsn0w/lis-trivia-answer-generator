This article is a **script** for [Episode 5: Polarized](episode_5__polarized.md).

## **Dark Room** 
''[Maxine Caulfield](max.md) wakes up tied to a chair in the [Dark Room (Location)](dark_room.md). If Max warned [Victoria Chase](victoria.md) about the Dark Room in the [Episode 4: Dark Room](previous_episode.md), she will be lying on the floor to Max's left, unconscious.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* [Chloe Price](chloe.md)...? What? Where? The Dark Room...

**Max:** *(shouting)* Is anybody out there?! Please, help!

**Optional Conversation with Victoria**

**Max:** *[turns to Victoria, panicked]* Victoria...wake up. *(fervently)* Wake up!

*Victoria groans but doesn't wake up.*

*Max successfully detaches her right foot from the chair.*

**Max:** *(thinking)'' Finally! I'm free! Almost...

*Max uses her foot to pull the trolley in front of her. She then looks at a photo [Mark Jefferson](jefferson.md) took of her.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* I hate looking at myself like that. You'll pay for this, Jefferson.

*Max focuses on the photo.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* I promised I would never go back in time like this again... But this is the only way...

## **First Focus** 
**Jefferson:** *(during the focus)* Oh, that's great... Oh, Max...

*Max wakes up lying on the ground with her hands tied, while Mr. Jefferson takes pictures of her.*

**Jefferson:** This angle highlights your purity, see? The slightly unconscious model is often the most open and honest. No vanity or posing just...pure expression.

''Jefferson moves Max's leg*

**Mr. Jefferson:** Oh Christ... Look at that perfect face.

*Max attempts to move her head, and Jefferson smacks her back into position.*

**Jefferson:** *(shouting)* Hold that stare there! *(angrily)* Stay still!

*Jefferson continues to take pictures. Max whimpers and tries to move.*

**Jefferson:** *(shouting angrily)* Oh, Max! You fucked up my shot! *(calmly)'' But please don't worry, we have all the time in the world. For now. I knew you were special the second I saw your first..."selfie". Yes, I still hate that word. But I love the purity of your own image. Not like [Rachel Amber](rachel.md), who was always looking in the wrong places. Poor Rachel. Wait... Let me try this angle.

*Jefferson steps over Max and continues to take pictures.*

**Jefferson:** Don't move!

''Jefferson positions Max's shoulder.''

**Jefferson:** Oh, much better... Thanks, Max. If only [Nathan Prescott](nathan.md) could see this setup. He tried so hard, but you can't just throw a few subjects around and expect a cohesive style or theme. But he had an eye for shadows. And an eye for a whole lot more, as his [Prescott Family](elite_family.md) will find out...along with [Arcadia Bay](arcadia_bay.md).

''Jefferson positions Max's head.*

**Jefferson:** Nice... Good... Oh, those eyes...

*Jefferson positions Max's shoulder again.''

**Jefferson:** It's just too bad you're so goddamn nosy, Max! But, this room...is under 24/7 surveillance, so all I had to do was text you from Nathan's phone, and you fell right into my hands. You really should have focused on schoolwork, not "private detecting" with your little...friend.

**Max:** Chloe...

**Jefferson:** Chloe, right. Yeah, I'm sorry I killedâ€”that Nathan killed her in self-defense. But she had a troubled history like most Arcadia Bay dropouts. Nobody will be surprised...or care. Though I promise...people will care when you die tonight, Max. I wasn't lying when I said you have a gift.

*Jefferson crouches to take photos.*

**Jefferson:** Okay... Now, this looks good. Maybe a few more close-ups...

*Max moves her head, and Jefferson stands up again.*

**Jefferson:** Max, please do not move so much. I need you posed and framed my way! Maybe a new dose will calm you down...

**Max:** No, no... No...

*Max whimpers and struggles as Jefferson drags the trolley over.*

**Jefferson:** *[fills the syringe with drugs from a vial]* Now don't move, or this will...hurt...much.

*Max kicks the trolley away and the vials of drugs fall, one breaking and spilling liquid over a folder.*

**Jefferson:** *(shouting angrily)* Stupid bitch! You just don't listen, do you? *(threateningly)* In fact, you never did hear much in my class; if you had, you might have seen all this coming.

*Jefferson crouches down next to Max.*

**Jefferson:** *(admiringly)* Goddamn, you are a fighter, though. I've had my eye on you, and I have noticed that you've been more...fearless this week than maybe your whole life.

*Max struggles and shakes her head.*

**Max:** *(mumbling quietly)* No...

**Jefferson:** Remember my number one rule. Always...take...the shot.

*Jefferson injects the needle into Max. She struggles and cries out, then goes limp as she falls unconscious.*
