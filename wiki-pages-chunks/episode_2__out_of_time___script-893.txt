tough...

*Frank looks at Max.*

**Frank:** What're you hiding there, girlie? Let me see!

*Frank points at Max and Chloe notices the bracelet on his wrist.*

**Chloe:** Where did you get that bracelet?

**Frank:** A friend. And it's none of your goddamn business. You're my business now and I--

**Chloe:** That's Rachel's bracelet! Why the fuck are you wearing her bracelet?!

**Frank:** Calm yourself, alright? It was a gift.

**Chloe:** No, it wasn't! You stole that shit! Give it to me right now, asshole!

*Chloe reaches for the bracelet. Frank pulls out a knife.*

**Frank:** You better step back before you regret it, girl. I mean it. You want me to cut you, bitch?

*Frank and Chloe look over at Max, who is pointing the gun at Frank.*

**Max:** Please...please step back.

**Frank:** You're kidding. Put that down.

SHOOTSHOOT*Max pulls the trigger, but the gun is out of bullets.*

**Frank:** That is hilarious! Oh, man... I'll remember you, kid. I'll remember you almost shot me. And you'll wish I had no memory, because I never forget. You have until Friday to pay me. Don't ever pull crap like this again. It'll be the last time you do. Try bullets next time, brainiacs.

*Frank puts the knife back in his pocket and leaves.*

**Max:** Sorry.

*Chloe hugs Max.*

**Chloe:** You were awesome. Thanks for standing up for me...Let's blow. My secret lair didn't feel secret today. At least Frank is gone; he won't fuck with us again. He just wants his money.

**Max (thinking):** ''Jesus, I almost shot this guy and now he'll be more dangerous to Chloe and me.''

|-|DON'T SHOOT# DON'T SHOOT**Frank:** Come on, girlie. Shoot me.

''Frank walks toward Max, who looks around uncertainly. Frank takes the gun out of Max's hands.''

**Frank:** Oh, Christ. You're more like Abbott and Costello. Nice piece. I'll consider this interest on your loan. Thanks. You have until Friday to pay me. Or I'll track you down with this interest. Have a good play, kids.

*Frank waves the gun tauntingly and leaves.*

**Chloe:** You really stood your ground.

**Max:** I freaked. I don't like guns.

**Chloe:** It'll be hard to keep Nathan off my ass... My step-shit will have his other guns sealed in an electrified bunker by now.

**Max:** Sorry, Chloe. I've never held a gun on a human being before. Not cool.

**Chloe:** I know, Max. Really. I'm actually relieved it worked out this way instead... And there are more guns out there...Let's blow. My secret lair didn't feel secret today. At least Frank is gone; he won't fuck with us again. He just wants his money.

**Max (thinking):** ''Oh, man, Frank took Chloe's gun because of me...*

**Max (thinking):** *Wowser, why did Frank have Rachel's bracelet? We need to talk about this later, but I better follow Chloe now. Chloe is waiting to go for a walk. We both need a time-out from here.*

*Max and Chloe leave the junkyard.''
