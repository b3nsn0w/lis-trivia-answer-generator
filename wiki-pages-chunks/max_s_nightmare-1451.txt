Here is a section of the wiki page for Max's Nightmare:

## Jefferson's Class 
Max sits through the same lecture from the beginning of the game, believing she is in a time loop. However, during the lesson the windows become slowly splattered with blood from dead birds hitting them. Nobody else in the classroom notices this. Suddenly the room is empty, and the windows are clear once again. Depending on Max's success in saving [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md), the place where she normally would sit is either splashed with blood or full of "I WANT TO DIE" scribbles. Max can pick up the note that was thrown at Kate, but this time it reads,

''"Max, if you're reading this, it means you're DEAD*

*Mr. Jefferson, xoxo"''

Looking out the window, Max notices dozens of dead birds lying in front of the school building. Pictures and posters in the room have changed now depicting Max in disturbing ways. The "Rachel Amber ♥ 4 ever" mark changes to "Max Caulfield ♥ 4 ever" and then "Chloe Price ♥ 4 ever" after looking at it. Max can take an [Optional Photos](optional_photo.md) of the scratches. She then wanders to the door as in the [Episode 1: Chrysalis](first_episode.md). [Mark Jefferson](jefferson.md) appears and calls her. Max is forced into a conversation with him, in which they uncomfortably discuss the events that happened in the [Dark Room (Location)](dark_room.md), and Max is forced to answer with inappropriate responses.

After the conversation, he disappears and Max can leave the room. She then finds herself, not in the [Blackwell Academy Hallway](corridor_of_blackwell.md), but in the hallway of the girl's side of the [Prescott Dormitory](prescott_dormitory.md).

## Dormitory Hall 
Max is confronted with walking down the hallway of the Dormitory towards Kate Marsh. When Max talks to her, she is abusive and blames Max for her suicide attempt. She opens her dorm room door and falls through. As it closes behind her, Max can follow. She ends up once again in the dormitory hallway. This time however, a key with a room number is visible and may be picked up on a bench by the shower room door. By looking at the number at each door and by referring to the dormitory map directory, the room number on the key is referring to [Dana's Room](dana_s_room.md). After opening Dana's room, she goes through and again finds herself at the entrance to the hallway.

This time, she is dressed in [Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md)'s clothes and the dormitory map directory will have some changes to some of the room occupants, listing Rachel Amber among the inhabitants. Max must enter through the first doorway on the left in order to progress; Rachel stayed there when she was at Blackwell. Max finds herself transformed into Victoria this time, and enters through [Victoria's Room](victoria_s_dorm_room.md) door to move on. One last time, she finds herself at the beginning of the hallways which are now covered in polaroids, while all the slates read "LOOK AT ME: I AM MAX SELFIE!". Max heads to her own room and finally enters it to appear in the hallway of Blackwell Academy.

#

## [Blackwell Academy](blackwell_academy.md) 
Max finds herself in the same setting as in the first episode in the hallway. Everything in this sequence of the nightmare is backwards. Max's speech is in reverse, as well as the actions of the characters in the scene. Max moves forward as she does in Episode 1, and puts in her earphones to listen to the now reversed soundtrack of "[To All of You](to_all_of_you.md)" by Syd Matters. Max then walks down towards the bathroom, following the spirit [doe](doe.md) at the end of the corridor. Near the entrance of the bathroom, the [Science Lab](science_lab.md) skeleton with an e-cigarette on its mouth will be propped up in one corner of the common area. Upon going near the science lab skeleton, an optional photo icon will appear on the bottom right corner of the screen. Max has to press the "Open Journal" button (Tab on PC) to take a reversed optional photo of the skeleton.

## Maze 
Upon entering the bathroom, Max finds herself in a dream-like atmosphere, with floating debris and darkened backdrops. Her outfit changes to the one she wore while in the [Zeitgeist Gallery](zeitgeist_gallery.md). With the [lighthouse](lighthouse.md) in the far off distance, she lands in a maze made up of walls with photographs from the Dark Room. Jefferson patrols the scene with a flashlight, attempting to catch her. Escaping Jefferson, she makes her way to a section with the Blackwell founder statue in the center, surrounded by gallery boards of Dark Room photos, with the voice of Ray Wells booming over loudspeakers. Max must avoid being spotted by the statue's light source, hiding behind the billboards. This leads her to a section filled with Blackwell school lockers. [Warren Graham](warren_graham.md), [Raymond Wells](principal_wells.md), [Samuel Taylor](samuel.md), [Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md) and [David Madsen](david_madsen.md) patrol the spaces between the lockers, chiding at Max, calling for her to come out, and saying negative things about her. The Blackwell campus directions sign points in three different ways, but every arrow leads to "DARK ROOM".  At one part of the locker area near Samuel's patrol spot, Max may discover Warren's locker. Upon opening the locker, Max will discover the interior of the locker is filled with pictures of Max in various swimwear. Max may take an optional photo of the interior of the locker.

Once past the patrols, Max finds herself in a nightmare version of the [American Rust Junkyard](american_rust_junkyard.md). Jefferson, Nathan and [Frank Bowers](frank_bowers.md) patrol here, looking for Max and making hurtful comments and observations. Here, Max can collect five bottles in order to line them up for an optional photo. There is also the opportunity for a [Moment of Calm (Life is Strange)](moment_of_peace.md), with a "sit" option beside the [hideout](hideout.md) Chloe and Rachel inhabited. After making her way through here, Max heads towards the bench beside the lighthouse and sits.
