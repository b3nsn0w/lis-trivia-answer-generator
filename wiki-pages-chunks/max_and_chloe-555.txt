Here is a section of the wiki page for Max and Chloe:

## Alternative Timeline 
[File:Maxstrip.jpg](thumb.md) In the alternative timeline, Max kept in touch with Chloe through letters on parchment paper, which is a hint at the fact that she still valued their friendship. She also sent Chloe one of her selfies from a road trip. However, William is surprised to see Max when answering the door, implying that she did not, in fact, keep in touch as much as she meant to.It took alternate Max 5 months to respond to Chloe, but alternate Chloe just four minutes to respond to Max. Max's diary entries and text messages reveal that Max only marginally thought about rekindling with Chloe since she's been back at Blackwell and that she has been more interested in partying with her new friends.

Chloe is extremely happy to see Max, unlike in the original timeline in which she was accusatory about Max abandoning her. It can be revealed that she was a little hurt by Max not visiting; but she understands, commenting that her friend isn't "SuperMax". Chloe still considers Max as her best friend, still cherishing their childhood memories a lot, and chooses to have Max's company as her last good memory.

The text of Max's letter to Chloe:

{{Bigquote
|''Chloe, just thought I'd drop you a quick note to let you know I'm thinking about you. I feel so lame writing shit like "I hope you are well" etc. I know your life is so different now and I don't want that to get in the way of our friendship. Yes, I haven't been around lately, but that will change soon.*

*"I hope you are well."*

*Love, Max''}}

## Mirroring 
In this alternative timeline, there is some amusing mirroring of the [Timeline](original_timeline.md). Alternative Max now says, "hella", much to Alternative Chloe's displeasure (she hates the very word that 'Original Chloe' loves). Alternative Chloe, in turn, comes out with a phrasing that Max uses on a couple of occasions in the original timeline: "the company I keep".

## Academic Life 
In this timeline, Max is a member of the Vortex Club and appears to be friends with [Victoria Chase](victoria_chase.md). Before Chloe became disabled, she was a straight-A student at Blackwell Academy, which Max discovers when she finds an old report card belonging to Chloe dated May 22nd, 2010. Once she became disabled in 2011, Chloe was no longer able to attend Blackwell Academy due to its lack of facilities to support her special needs.
