## Romantic
*[Chloe Price](chloe_price.md) (**Determinant**) - There are several romantic implications in the relationship between Chloe and Max, revolving around their fondness for each other and Max's option to kiss Chloe in the third episode. Max is also often seen to be jealous of Chloe's close relationship with Rachel that has been formed during her absence. Based on Max's behavior and decisions, Chloe will change her mobile phone background from Rachel, who is considered to be her former love interest, to Max. After their Blackwell night trip, Chloe dares Max to kiss her, which will impact their relationship as time goes on. If she decides to kiss Chloe, Max will later refer to that kiss in Frank's RV, when Chloe is daydreaming about a trip to Portland, saying, "And you'd probably want me to kiss you again." After returning from the alternative timeline, based on Max's earlier decision, Max expresses the wish to kiss Chloe again in her journal or regrets that she didn't kiss her if Max didn't choose to kiss her in Episode 3. Additionally, if Max turned down Warren's invitation to the drive-in and decided to kiss Chloe, Warren will write Max a message and tell her he understands why she did it and that she should go to the drive-in with Chloe. The way Chloe is portrayed in [Max's Nightmare](max_s_nightmare.md), flirting with other people and talking Max down, reflects Max's insecurities towards Chloe, and heavily implies feelings of jealousy and fears of rejection, feeling inadequate for Chloe. If Max and Chloe kissed in Episode 3, Max's last journal entry may state that Chloe is more than her best friend, and that's why she probably hated "Chloe being mean... calling me names and flirting with those people" in the nightmare. She then goes on to wonder if it was the "power of friendship... or love" and that she was about to find out. If Max didn't kiss her in Episode 3 her entry is more inclined to friendship, she states that Chloe will always be her best friend, but nonetheless, she says she's about to find out if it's more than that. This is further proof that she will be oblivious to her feelings about Chloe and will newly start to realize those feelings after the nightmare sequence; if Max didn't choose to kiss her in Episode 3. When Max and Chloe have to face their final obstacle at the end of "Polarized", Max refers to Chloe as her top priority and all that matters to her, after constantly desperately trying to keep her by her side during the game. After making their farewells, Chloe will tell her that she will always love her, and Max will say that she will never forget her. If Max sides with Chloe throughout the story, she will finally beat her insecurities and fears about Chloe's rejection, especially after her nightmare, and kiss her before Max allows Chloe to die to save the town in the Sacrifice Chloe ending. If Max didn't kiss Chloe or didn't make enough choices that defend her or take her side, they will share a hug instead; but it might be possible however Max's feelings would still remain the same. With the decision to sacrifice Arcadia Bay, she may even decide to sacrifice a whole town to keep Chloe alive and to be with Chloe for the rest of her life. *(See [Max and Chloe](here.md) for more information on their relationship.)*
*[Warren Graham](warren_graham.md) (**Determinant**) - Although Max neglects his affection, sometimes even being flat out oblivious to it, it is clear that he has a crush on her. Warren asks Max to go to see a movie with him, and Max is given the choice of accepting or rejecting this offer. Either way, Max states in her journal that she sees him as a geek brother as opposed to a potential partner. Based on Max's decision and behavior, she will either reflect on the invitation as having fun with Warren and "taking a chance", or feel bad about it for *leading him on.* Regardless of whether Max accepts or rejects Warren's movie date, Warren stays by her side to support her after Kate's suicide attempt.In the alternative timeline, Max appears to be confused that Warren has a relationship with Stella, but this could simply be a result of her astonishment to how severe the butterfly effect was. If Kate was rescued by Max, the former comments that they would make a perfect couple and supports the optional date between them when Max visits her in the hospital. Based on Max's previous decision, she will either tell Kate that she turned his invite down, or mention the date and say she'll see, referring to Kate's previous comment about him liking Max. While in the boys' dormitories, Max can write a cute message"Are you made of copper and tellurium? Because you're CuTe." Max was referencing [https://imgur.com/gallery/CxUOPFt this meme].  *to have a little fun of with him for a change, *on Warren's dorm room slate. Based on Max's earlier decision to accept or decline Warren's invitation, Max will either reflect on it as "taking a chance and see what happens" or thinks "he tries so hard and she blew off his drive-in offer". She will also comment on it as, "I hope Warren doesn't think it's too dorky... I mean, not like he isn't." When Max later asks Warren to give her the photograph of the night at the Vortex Club party, before focusing on the photo, Max has the option to leave, hug or kiss Warren. If she decides to kiss him, Warren will tell Max he's always wanted to tell her something, but Max cuts him off and tells him she knows. She will also comment to herself stating that at least she kissed Warren once to let him know how she feels. Though, like before, this may not be romantic, but just a way for Max shows how much she cares about him. If she hugs Warren, she will comment to herself saying she hopes Warren will know just how much she cherishes their friendship. *(See [Max and Warren](here.md) for more information on their relationship.)*
