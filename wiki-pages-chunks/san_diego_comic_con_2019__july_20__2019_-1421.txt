, in Life is Strange 2. I really love his work, and I think players also love the soundtrack of the first season.

**Lucy:** Absolutely. Definitely.

**Raoul:** So we have continued with him, but we wanted also to explore new themes, and as it's a road trip structure, maybe have the score changing a lot more than in the first season. So, for each episode, you've got like maybe two or three themes composed by Jonathan linked to the characters you meet, linked to the seasons, linked to the environments. It was really important to change a bit with-- And I think Captain Spirit is a good example of what we tried to do. So, in Captain Spirit, you've got the music from [Death with Dignity](sufjan_stevens.md), a folk artist, in the beginning, and in the very end when you see the power and the end of Captain Spirit, you got this electronic music from French artist [Parade](rone.md). And it was this evolution we wanted to show coming from the first season [which was] more folk, and with season 2 with electronic sound in it. So it was the idea for Captain Spirit to create a link between the two seasons, and we wanted also to continue to have licensed tracks in this season 2. So, like you said, all the tracks we pick are linked to the characters. We want to tell something about the characters with the tracks we choose. So Max was listening to Syd Matters or [Crosses](jos__gonz_lez.md) songs - so very neo-folk music - when Sean is listening to [On The Flip Of A Coin](the_streets.md) - a hip-hop artist from England. So I think it tells us something about the characters. Like Chloe was listening to PJ Harvey... artists like that. In the first season, the music you listen to is really telling something about you, so it's interesting to use it this way and also to have licensed tracks on top of things, like in cinema or in movies. So, having this cinematographic feeling, I think, a song - existing song - can add a lot of emotion to a moment, to a scene. So, it was the idea to continue like this.

**Lucy:** How does the process work? So, is it more skewed towards-- Raoul, do you really want a song to be in a scene, and then, Jean-Luc, do you have to write around that song? Or, Jean-Luc, do you write the section and then, Raoul, you pick the track to go along with that?
**Jean-Luc:** When I'm writing, most of the time, I'm writing without music to [not] be disturbed, to be really into a scene. But, sometimes, when I'm listening to a tune, I'm telling to Raoul, "Listen to this, what do you think about this? I've written this scene while I was listening to this." And I remember, on the other end, sometimes, Raoul comes to me, and says, "Okay, on what scene are you working?" I'm working on, for example, for the end of Episode 3. "Okay, this will be the song we will add in the game." So I put on my headphones, and I'm writing all the scene, all the ending scene of Episode 3 with the music, so I think it helped me a lot to see the images I want [to] put on the paper.

**Raoul:** Sometimes, we manage to pick a song very quickly.

**Lucy:** Yeah.

**Raoul:** And sometimes, because, of course, I'm not the only one - even though I'm taking the final decision - I talk a lot with the audio team, with Jean-Luc, with Michel to be sure that this song is accurate and is a good one. So it takes a lot of time, and sometimes you don't have, for example, the rights, or it's too expensive, or the artists say, "No." So it depends, but, yeah, when it works and when we can have it earlier, I think the process is quite good. For Episode 3, the ending, and the *[D.A.N.C.E.](justice.md)* scene, I knew since the beginning what other song I wanted.

**Lucy:** That's cool.

**Raoul:** So very quickly, we can work with the camera artists. [Dontnod staff member name needed] has made this scene with the *Justice* song and the one with *[Natalie](milk_and_bone.md)* at the end of Episode 3. And I think those scenes are working well, also, because we had the music before, and we can really shape the camera, so editing with the music in head.

**Lucy:** I would love to discuss music more with you guys, but, unfortunately, time is not on our side, so we might have to go straight to the Q and A. So, if anyone has any burning questions for Raoul and Jean-Luc and would love to ask them, please, come up to the microphone right in the middle, and fire away. We've got about ten minutes or so for Q and A so, please, feel free.
