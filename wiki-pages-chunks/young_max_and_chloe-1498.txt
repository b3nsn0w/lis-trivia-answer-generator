* **Graffiti/Carving –** Either Max or Chloe wrote/carved their names on a tree stump by the lighthouse in 2008.

(Episode 1 - tree stump 'BFF Pirates' graffiti dated 2008, cliff.)
***Halloween Bazaar –** Max and Chloe enjoyed the kiddie costume parade that took place at the town's annual Halloween bazaar. The parade is led by the Arcadia Bay mayor along [Arcadia Bay Ave](main_street.md), and a flyer seen in the [Two Whales Diner](two_whales_diner.md) shows that there may also have been a pumpkin carving contest and local vendors and food trucks at the past bazaars when Chloe and Max were young.Max: "Now that brings back memories... Chloe and I loved the parade..." (Episode 2 - Costume Parade Flyer, [Two Whales Diner](two_whales_diner.md).)
***Recording Heights –** Chloe was always taller than Max when they were growing up together. They made Chloe's dad keep track of their heights.Max: "Chloe was always taller than me. We made her dad keep track of our height." (Episode 1 - Chloe's room.) There is a height chart on Chloe's bedroom wall that marks Chloe's height over the years from 13 months up until 2005, but there are no markers with Max's name by the side, which may mean that Chloe's dad could have recorded Max's height on a separate chart elsewhere. Perhaps Max took her results home to record them herself somehow. There are some little marks underneath the recordings for 1996 and a year that looks to be 2000, so perhaps these little marks belonged to Max.
