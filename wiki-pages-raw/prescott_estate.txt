The '''Prescott Estate''' is a non-explorable location in ''[[Life is Strange]]''. It is the residence of the [[Prescott Family|Prescott family]], namely of [[Nathan Prescott]], [[Sean Prescott]] and his wife, and presumably the previous home of [[Kristine Prescott]].

The Prescott Estate is not heavily featured in the game, probably due to Nathan living full time on the [[Blackwell Academy]] [[Blackwell Campus|campus]], and not at home with his family.

He does, however, visit there often as evident from [[David's Files|David's records]] of Nathan's car coordinates from Episode 4, "[[Episode 4: Dark Room|Dark Room]]".
