'''The Forks''' posters appear to be all over town, even in places such as the [[Prescott Dormitory|Prescott Dormitories]] at [[Blackwell Academy]] and [[Chloe's Room|Chloe's bedroom]]. It is unknown what ''The Forks'' is, though it appears to be very popular in [[Arcadia Bay]].

It is completely unknown what the poster references, although some suggest that the poster is for a local band or restaurant. However, the poster is most likely just a piece of filler added by the developers to create a more lived-in atmosphere for the game's world.

''The Forks'' logo poster appears to be dirty around the edges, square, and white with a scared or startled sentient piece of food on the cover (most likely a peach or tomato). It has the name "The Forks" under it with a small fork logo.
