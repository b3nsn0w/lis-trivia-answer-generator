|Dear Joyce,

Thank you for keeping me updated on Chloe's
condition. I can only imagine the struggle you
and [[William Price|William]] are going through. I am so sorry
that I can't help you with a loan at this time.

Like everybody else, I'm underwater with my own
medical bills. Please give Chloe a hug and my
best wishes.

Love, Aunt Dorothy
