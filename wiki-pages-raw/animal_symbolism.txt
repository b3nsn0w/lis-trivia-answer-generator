'''Animal symbolism''' appears in the ''[[Life is Strange (franchise)|Life is Strange]]'' franchise, usually as a symbol of something important to the story or main characters and often in the form of "spirit animals." Some appear to be connected, guide, watch over or warn the protagonist.
The only developer-confirmed spirit animals so far are the [[Blue Butterfly|blue butterfly]] ([[Chloe Price|Chloe]]), squirrel ([[Samuel Taylor|Samuel]]), and the [[Doe|doe]] ([[Maxine Caulfield|Max]]).

== Spirit Animals & Animal Symbolism ==

=== ''Life is Strange'' ===
* [[Blue Butterfly]] - The blue butterfly could represent a butterfly effect of the choices throughout the game. It could be the catalyst for Max's power as it seemed to glow, had a presence in the air around it and was unaffected by Max's first rewind. The color blue is associated with both the butterfly and [[Chloe Price|Chloe]]. There is also a poster of a blue butterfly in the [[Chloe Price#Alternative Timeline|alternative timeline Chloe]]'s empty room as well as butterflies as part of a pattern on Chloe's boots. The only entry in [[Max's Nightmare Journal|Max's nightmare journal]] features a drawing of a butterfly with Chloe's head. For Christians butterflies are a symbol of rebirth. The texture file of that drawing is named ''Spirit_animal_Chloe'', which reinforces the theory of the butterfly being Chloe's spirit animal. In the Sacrifice Chloe ending, a blue butterfly is landing on Chloe's coffin.<ref name=":0">In the [[Director's Commentary]], it has been said that there is a lot of symbolism behind the butterfly and the fact that Chloe has got some butterflies on her tattoo. Chloe's hair color was confirmed to be based on the blue butterfly.</ref>

* [[Doe]] - There are many theories surrounding the true meaning of the [[doe]] in the game. One is that the doe is the spirit of [[Rachel Amber]]. This could be likely considering that it appears over her burial site, and again when the body of Rachel is discovered. Another likely theory is that the doe is simply Max's spirit animal sent to guide her through her time-travel ordeal. It leads her to the burial site days before the discovery of the body, and bows its head in peaceful reverence for the dead when Max and Chloe find the body. Due to the doe T-shirt designs that Max wears (as well as doe necklace during one of the game endings), [[Maxine Caulfield|Max Caulfield]] has a connection to this animal and so the doe could be Max's spirit animal. Another fact that lends more support to this theory is that the doe seems immune to Max's rewind power, just like the blue butterfly Max sees in the girls' bathroom at the start of the game. After Max becomes aware of her power not even the blue butterfly is immune, only Max and the doe seem to share this immunity. The doe also guides Max in two occasions, during the lighthouse climb in the final of Episode 1 and during a short part of her nightmare in Episode 5. [[Samuel Taylor]] says that the doe is Max's spirit animal and that it could be a sign of her destiny when she tells him that a doe was looking right at her like it was trying to communicate. Max's personality traits fit far better with the doe spirit animal than that of Rachel, making it likely that it is her true spirit animal, or totem.
* Squirrel - The squirrels in spite the seemingly unimportant presence in the game, they are the only animal present in all five episodes, and they are featured in Max's optional photos for every single Episode. The groundskeeper of Blackwell seem to have a special affinity and connection to the cuddly creatures claiming that his Spirit Animal is in fact a squirrel.
