The '''"Weird Lady"''' is a resident of [[Arcadia Bay]], who [[Maxine Caulfield|Max Caulfield]] encounters in the [[Two Whales Diner]] in Episodes 2 and 3.

== Episode Two - "[[Episode 2: Out of Time|Out of Time]]" ==
Following her conversation with [[Diner Fisherman|a fisherman]], Max approaches the woman sitting in the corner booth. Observing the woman first, Max notes that she always wondered what people thought about when they ate alone.

When Max decides to speak to the Weird Lady, she greets Max with a pronounced Canadian accent. The Weird Lady says that it's a beautiful day, and that it’s going to be a super day. She tells Max to enjoy her breakfast before returning to gazing out the window.

== Episode Three - "[[Episode 3: Chaos Theory|Chaos Theory]]" ==
The lady is sitting in the diner again. This time she has a different booth and is still looking in the window. Max cannot interact with her.

== Episode Five - "[[Episode 5: Polarized|Polarized]]" ==
She appears in the diner sequence of [[Max's Nightmare|Max's nightmare]], standing behind several Arcadia Bay citizens.

In the Sacrifice Arcadia Bay ending, she apparently dies in the storm.
