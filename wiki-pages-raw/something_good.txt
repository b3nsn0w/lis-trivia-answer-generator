== Lyrics ==

: Something good, oh, something good
: Oh, something good, something good
: Tonight will make me forget about you for now
: Get high, hit the floor before you go, matador
: Estocada, you're my blood sport

: Something good, oh, something good
: Oh, something good, something good
: Tonight will make me forget about you, for now
: Forty-eight thousand seats bleats
: And roars for my memories of you

: Now that I'm fully clean
: The matador is no more and is dragged from view
: Get high, hit the floor before you go
: Matador, estocada, you're my blood sport

: Forty-eight thousand seats bleats
: And roars for my memories of you
: Now that I am clean
: The matador is no more and is dragged from view

: But something good, oh, something good
: Oh, something good, something good
: Will make me forget about you for now
