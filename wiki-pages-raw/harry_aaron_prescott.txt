He is presumably deceased, and the father, or grandfather, of [[Sean Prescott]], [[Nathan Prescott|Nathan]]'s father.

== Background ==
The Prescott family seem to have strong roots in [[Arcadia Bay]], donating to create a new library in the town. They also seem to have lent money to people, and owned much property around the area; not unlike the 2013 Prescotts.

== Episode Four - [[Episode 4: Dark Room|"Dark Room"]] ==
The old [[barn]] in [[Episode 4: Dark Room]] is registered as being owned under his name. The barn is featured in the episode as the location for the Prescott Bunker (also known as the [[Dark Room (Location)|Dark Room]]), in which devious acts were committed against female victims.
