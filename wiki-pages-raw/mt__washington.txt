== Lyrics ==
: Face stain in the ceiling<br /> 
: Why does it keep saying,<br /> 
: "I don't have to see you right now"<br /> 
: "I don't have to see you right now"

: Digging like you can bury<br /> 
: Something that cannot die<br /> 
: We could wash the dirt off our hands now<br /> 
: Keep it from living underground<br /> 
: Praise the summer goddess<br /> 
: You can tell a whole empire<br /> 
: "I don't have to see you right now"<br /> 
: "I don't have to see you right now"

: "I don't have to see you right now" (x4)
