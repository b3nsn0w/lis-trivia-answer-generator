=== Synopsis ===
The story follows [[Alex Chen]], a young Asian-American woman who - after eight years in the Oregon foster care system - reunites with her brother [[Gabe]] in the cozy midwestern town of [[Haven Springs]], Colorado. Her fresh start at Haven is shaken by the sudden and mysterious death of her brother.

=== Official Description ===
"Alex Chen hides her 'curse': the psychic power of Empathy, the ability to absorb the emotions of others. When her brother dies in a so-called accident, Alex must embrace her power to find the truth."

== Theories ==

* Many fans believed that the protagonists from the past games (such as Max, Chloe, Rachel, Sean, or Daniel) would either make a cameo appearance or be mentioned in the game. This was proven incorrect in the main story, but it is partially correct in the bonus story. Chloe and Rachel are mentioned by Mikey and Steph, who will remember some past conversations where Chloe and Rachel's voices can be heard. Max is indirectly mentioned if Arcadia Bay was sacrificed in the first game.
* In ''Wavelengths'', it was confirmed that an old friend of Steph's will appear. Fans speculated that the friend was [[Mikey North]], who also appeared in ''Before the Storm''. This theory was confirmed to be correct in the DLC trailer.
* Although Gabe's death was said to be an accident in the trailer, it is possible that he was killed, either intentionally or accidentally. This theory was proven correct when it is revealed that a planned explosion caused a falling rock to kill Gabe.
* It was speculated that some of the characters introduced in the trailer could have ulterior motives. Fans also believed that there could be hidden antagonists involved. Both theories were proven correct when it is revealed that the antagonists are Jed and Diane, who work for the rogue mining company Typhon.
*Some fans presumed that some of the main characters would die depending on the choices made throughout the game. This theory was proven incorrect.
*Because ''True Colors'' takes place after the other ''Life is Strange'' games, some fans believed that the final choices from the other games would impact this gameâ€™s storyline. This theory was proven incorrect in the main story, but it is partially correct in the bonus story. The final choice in the first game affects Steph and Mikey's past memories of Arcadia Bay.
*Some fans believed that [[Mark Jefferson]] would return in this story as the main antagonist and responsible for Gabe's death. This theory was proven incorrect in the main story, but it is partially correct in the bonus story. Jefferson appears on a newspaper article in Steph's laptop if Chloe was sacrificed in the first game, but he himself does not play a major role in the story.
*It was speculated that Alex would discover her powers during the game, similar to how Max and Daniel discovered theirs. This theory was proven incorrect, as Alex says that she has had her powers prior to her arrival at Haven. How she discovered them is unexplained.
*Some believed that an incident that involved Alex's powers is the reason why Alex ended up in foster care. This theory is proven incorrect.
*The secrets hidden within Haven Springs were thought to have connections with events from the past games. This was proven wrong as there is no mention of any events from the earlier games.
*It was believed that the game could have at least 2-4 alternate endings like the previous games. This theory was proven correct, as it is revealed that there are four alternate endings in total.
*Some speculated that Alex (unconsciously) killed Gabe herself due to her powers, and the entire point of the game was for her to come to terms with herself. This theory was proven incorrect.
*Some fans believed that making certain choices would determine who killed Gabe. This was proven incorrect.
*It was speculated that Gabe's death could be suicide with a yet unexplained reason. This was proven false.
*It could be possible that Gabe faked his death, but the reason why is yet to be revealed. This was proven wrong.

== Development ==
Deck Nine Games had started working on the game in late 2017,<ref>[[Square Enix Presents 2021]] (March 18, 2021)</ref>, presumably shortly after the development of ''Before the Storm'' was completed. They were surprised at the positive reception for [[Steph Gingrich]], so they included her in the game.

The voice actors were contracted to work in in 2018, with their work motion capture voice recording occurring from late 2018 to very early 2021, with Wavelengths occurring in November to January 2021. Since their studio is located in Colorado, they had flown actors from various places, such as Katy Bentz taken from [[Los Angeles]]. In 2020, the development of the game was forced to change to remote work. Voice actors were sent home and given equipment for voice recording, rather than in studio.

== Trivia ==
[[File:Zombie Crypt_Outfit_Chloe_Comparison.jpg|thumb|170px|"Zombie Crypt" outfit from Before the Storm Remastered and the comics.]]
* The pre-order bonus "Zombie Crypt" outfit, which is included in the [[Before the Storm Remastered]] edition and the Ultimate Edition of ''Life is Strange: True Colors'', is a nod to the [[Life is Strange (Comic Series)|comic series]]. Chloe Price is wearing a shirt with the same design in issue 1, page 9, 11-18.
* Alex can be seen wearing a [[Hawt Dawg Man]] t-shirt in the trailer.
*This is the second ''Life is Strange'' game where deaths are unavoidable (the LARP deaths do not count as they are just pretend). The first was ''[[Life is Strange: Before the Storm|Before the Storm]]''.<br /><br /><br />
