== Personal Life ==
Ashly Burch stated that she suffers from anxiety. (To Be Continued)

''"I grew up when YouTube was kind of becoming the goliath that it is now. And it's easy to get sucked into wanting to make a viral video... I think you see a lot of stuff online that isn't made necessarily with love. It's not even to say that they're unsuccessful, but for me, the whole point of being into anything creative is because you love the process."''<ref>[http://moviepilot.com/posts/3668744 'RocketJump': Ashly Burch On Comandeering The Director's Chair In "Fan Friction"] </ref>
