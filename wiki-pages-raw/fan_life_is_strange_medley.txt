== Lyrics ==
[Song 1: Left Alone]
:I wish that they had listened
:I wish that they had cared
:Your life is in my hands now
:How could it come to this?
:It seems like things could be so simple
:Such an easy fix

[Song 2: The Place To Be]
:In my head, there's pictures that are never fading
:Long after you've turn dark
:Little things remind me of the world inside you
:But there's no need for us to mourn
:'Cause you are never really gone

:These colors seem never as warm, I feel a
:Stiff breeze as we weather the storm and yet I
:Let it all wash right over me
:I close my eyes and I see
:This is the place to
:This is the place to

[Song 3: Heartbeat]
:Wanna see me let go?
:You wanna hear the silence?
:Tell me I should care
:If you could see my face now
:You wouldn't take that shot, well
:I won't be the same
:You can't tell me to feel
:Watch me

:I won't tell you how to live
:Any day now you could give me a smile
:And you'd say, "Let's be stupid together"
:The truth is really simple
:We'd be right back in a heartbeat

[Song 4: Blinding Darkness]
:Every little memory seems to haunt me
:How am I the only one to really care?
:I believe there's nothing left to save me
:I'm on my own along this journey now
:Bring me all the way to the light of day
:You blind me now you're gone
:And fire's leading dawn

[Song 5: Borrowed Time]
:There is no need to be cynical
:Some things are not what they seem
:And if you don't believe me
:I'll show you what I mean

:And he can't touch me now
:This is our world
:For all that we've been through
:And there is no way out
:There ain't no point in wondering
:Forever I'll be here with you
:And this will be our time
:(This will be our time)
:This will be our time
:(This will be our time)
:This will be our time
