== Trivia ==
*The "Meter Made" achievement could be a reference to the Beatles song "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_AQZf-Q6XM Lovely Rita]". This is likely due to the other [[References (Life is Strange)|references]] made by Warren associated with the band.
*In the [[Alternative Timeline (Life is Strange)|alternative timeline]], Max leaves her camera bag on the [[Blackwell Campus|Blackwell campus]] floor. This is probably the reason why she doesn't take any pictures in this timeline.
*At the end of the game, Max will still have the photos she took during the game because she keeps any object in her inventory even if she rewinds.
*While playing in "Collectible Mode" the player can collect all the photos several times, except for the last one during Max's nightmare. After the photo is taken once, the bottles break and can never be collected or posed for the shot again.
