'''Dr. Jacoby''' is [[Nathan Prescott]]'s psychiatrist. He is only mentioned in a letter from him to [[Sean Prescott]], in which he asks for consultation with Sean and his wife to be able to help Nathan as he feels disregards for his suggestions, which can be found in the [[Episode 4: Dark Room (Location)|Dark Room]] in [[Episode 4: Dark Room|Episode 4]]. It reads as follows:

{{Bigquote

|Dear Mr. Prescott,

As Nathan's primary psychiatrist for over five years, I feel that I should stop seeing your son as you have disregarded my rather dire and immediate suggestion for his — and others' — well-being.

You know well the extent of Nathan's challenges but I feel that you refuse to acknowledge the role you play in his mental health.
If I do not have your support, I cannot treat Nathan, it is as simple as that. I fear he is becoming even more disconnected from reality, even if he acts in a personable manner. 

You have ignored my requests for a consultation with you and your wife so I have to assume you are no longer interested in my services.
Regardless, I care about Nathan and I believe he needs serious help.

If you would like to talk about this matter, I am always available.

Best,

Dr. Jacoby

== Trivia ==
* His name is a possible nod to the psychiatrist [[w:c:twinpeaks:Lawrence Jacoby|Dr. Lawrence Jacoby]] from the television series ''[[w:c:twinpeaks:Twin Peaks|Twin Peaks]]''. This speculation is based on the [[References_(Season_1)#Twin_Peaks|references]] and parallels to this show that can be found throughout Season 1.
