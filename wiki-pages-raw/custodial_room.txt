The '''Custodial Room''' is located to the right of the [[Prescott Dormitory]] entrance and is used by [[Blackwell Academy|Blackwell]]'s janitor [[Samuel Taylor]].

== Episode One - "[[Episode 1: Chrysalis|Chrysalis]]" ==
[[Maxine Caulfield|Max Caulfield]] enters the room to crank up the sprinkler valve, which drenches [[Victoria Chase]], [[Taylor Christensen|Taylor]], and [[Courtney Wagner]], causing them to stand up and leave the stairs where they were sitting.

== Episode Two - "[[Episode 2: Out of Time|Out of Time]]" ==
Max has a second opportunity to explore the room; she can find photos of [[Rachel Amber]] posing and a box labeled "Sammy's stuff". Outside, she can ask Samuel, who sits on a bench, about the photos.
Samuel also keeps a missing person poster of Rachel Amber in his custodial room.

== Episode Three - "[[Episode 3: Chaos Theory|Chaos Theory]]" ==
Max can enter the room once again as the door is not locked. Inside, she can find a scarf, a fashion magazine, a box with an empty paint bucket and several toolboxes.

== Trivia ==

Samuel's janitor room that can't be entered from the custodial room but very likely was originally meant to be an explorable area since there exists detailed concept art for the room.
