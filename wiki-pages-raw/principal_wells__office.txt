'''Principal Wells' Office''' is the office of the current principal of [[Blackwell Academy]], [[Principal Wells|Ray Wells]]. It is an explorable location featured in Episode 3, "[[Episode 3: Chaos Theory|Chaos Theory]]".

== Interior ==
The walls of the office are covered with expensive wood and adorned with paintings. [[Maxine Caulfield|Max]] thinks that it "looks like an oil painting spill". Near the big window, there are several bookcases, which Max may examine to obtain Student Files. [[Kate Marsh|Kate]]'s Student File lies open on a table in the far end of the room, while the files for former students are stored in a metal case. One of the bookcases hosts Principal Wells' whiskey.

The central element of this room is a big table with a bronze hawk and the monitor of [[Principal Wells' Computer]] on it. Various papers and letters to [[David]] and [[Ms. Grant]] are also scattered on the table. The "handicapped fund" envelope is stored inside one of the drawers. There is also a "cosy chair" made of leather, which [[Chloe Price|Chloe]] likes so much that she even considers stealing it from the office.

== Episode One - "[[Episode 1: Chrysalis|Chrysalis]]" ==
At the beginning of the game, Max has the opportunity to come near the door of the office. She will comment that the Principal doesn't come out of there much. The interior of the office appears in the ending cutscene. Principal Wells is seen drinking whiskey as he witnesses the snowfall through a big window.

== Episode Two - "[[Episode 2: Out of Time|Out of Time]]" ==
[[File:Wellsoffice-ep2.png|thumb|left|200px]] Max is summoned to the office along with David Madsen, [[Nathan Prescott]] and [[Mark Jefferson]] to further investigate Kate's suicide (attempt). [[Officer Berry]] will be present if Kate is dead. Max has to blame Kate's situation on either David, Nathan or Jefferson, and may suspend someone or get suspended depending on earlier choices. If Jefferson isn't blamed, he comments that Max and Nathan need a break before Wells can investigate further. If Max blames Jefferson, he suggests investigating other staff members as well. Then Max signs a statement to confirm her words and everyone leaves the office.

== Episode Three - "[[Episode 3: Chaos Theory|Chaos Theory]]" ==
[[File: LifeIsStrange 2015-05-26 10-46-35-67.png|thumb|left|200px]]
The office becomes explorable in this episode. Max and Chloe break into Blackwell with the aid of a spare set of keys from David, but fail to find the key to the Principal's office. With help from [[Warren Graham|Warren]], Max manages to construct a makeshift pipe bomb and blows the lock up. This causes the school alarm to go off, and Max rewinds time and opens the door for Chloe from the inside. Once in the office, Chloe searches for information on Wells' [[Principal Wells' Computer|computer]] while Max gathers the Student Files for Kate, Nathan and [[Rachel Amber|Rachel]]. Chloe finds Nathan's real file and a creepy drawing. Prior to leaving the office, Chloe discovers an envelope with 5000 dollars in it and wants to take the money so she can pay Frank back. It is up to Max on whether to allow Chloe to steal the money or not. Regardless of her decision, Chloe wants to go to the [[Blackwell Swimming Pool]].

== Interactions ==
