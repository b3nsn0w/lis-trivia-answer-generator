== Lyrics ==
: Some years ago
: I lived a hard life
: But sunlight burst a ray
: Through those clouds

: We've finally seen the back
: Of those grey days
: Please let the summer back to stay

: And hold a sunbird in your hands
: Don't let him sing too sweet
: For too soon the summer sun
: Will in winter sleep
: And hold a sunbird in your hands
: Don't let him sing too sweet
: For too soon the summer sun
: Will in winter sleep

: You found yourself on the road
: Inside your winter coat
: But leave your troubles behind, now
: You wrap yourself in a ball
: Then hide away from it all
: But let the sunbird in your heart

: And hold a sunbird in your hands
: Don't let him sing too sweet
: For too soon the summer sun
: Will in winter sleep
: And hold a sunbird in your hands
: Don't let him sing too sweet
: For too soon the summer sun
: Will in winter sleep

: OooooOoooOooo (x6)

: And hold a sunbird in your hands
: Don't let him sing too sweet
: For too soon the summer sun
: Will in winter sleep

== Interpretation ==
The song is used in the trailer for "Chrysalis" going free. This made the game available to more players, and for someone it may have been a reason to replay it. The first verse makes a reference to how the game has helped players through hard times. Immediately after a request is made for summer, i.e. happiness, to return.<ref>"Please let the summer back to stay"</ref> The song tells us to appreciate the happy moments in life,<ref>"And hold the sunbird in your hands"</ref> but not too much, as they might end quickly.<ref>"Don't let him sing too sweet, for too soon the summer sun will be in a winter sleep"</ref> The game is short, but despite that, it still provides a way to forget about everyday problems for a moment and lose yourself in a fictional world.<ref>"But leave your troubles behind, now"</ref>
