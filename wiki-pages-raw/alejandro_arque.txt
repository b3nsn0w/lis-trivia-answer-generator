* According to an [https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/41jqaf/interview_alejandro_arque_life_is_strange_game/ interview,] his favorite [[Easter Eggs (Life is Strange)|easter eggs]] in ''Life is Strange'' are the references to ''Harry Potter'' and ''Doctor Who''.
* The following was stated during the [[Blackwell Podcast]] interview:
**There was nothing that was rejected before the final conception of ''Life is Strange''. Square Enix loved everything that was presented to them by DONTNOD. Things were polished, but nothing was rejected. And this is unusual.
**His original reaction to ''Life is Strange'' when it was first presented to him was, "Whoa!" He was wondering if DONTNOD were really going to that way with the slap Chloe receives from her [[David Madsen|step-father]], as he says he had never seen this kind of thing in a video game before, and because seeing that affected him. He was really impressed by the game and felt he really wanted to work on it.
**It was never their intention of making an "{{Wiki|AAA (video game industry)|AAA}}" game from the start. They wanted to do something that felt "indie" and intended to make ''Life is Strange'' more reminiscent of {{Wiki|Sundance Film Festival}} films, because the game is different. The story needed to fit the visuals and the audios of the game.
**Alejandro also stated that some people say the game is not realistic or, "Why aren't the graphics better?" But he thinks the graphics are great, because they show what they wanted to show. They never intended the game to look realistic, as realism doesn't fit the story they wanted to tell.
