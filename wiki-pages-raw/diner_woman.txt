The "'''Diner Woman'''" is a resident of [[Arcadia Bay]]. She is standing at the bus stop near the [[Two Whales Diner]] in Episode 2.

== Episode Two - "[[Episode 2: Out of Time|Out of Time]]" ==
When [[Maxine Caulfield|Max Caulfield]] is getting off the school bus, this woman can be heard talking to an [[Old Guy|old man]] standing nearby. He tells her not to take his lottery ticket from him, to which she responds she wouldn't dream of it. Max comments on her looking busy, stressed and lost. She will ask Max if the bus has come yet. Max may respond that she just got off the school bus, and the regular bus should be coming shortly, or that she doesn't know the bus time. Either way, the woman will tell us that she is going to a job interview in Newport. It is evident from her words that she has trouble living in Arcadia Bay. Max wishes her good luck and the woman thanks her in response.

== Episode Four - "[[Episode 4: Dark Room|Dark Room]]" ==
If [[Kate Marsh]] survived, Max and [[Chloe Price]] go to the [[hospital]] to see her. This woman can be briefly seen working on a computer.

== Episode Five - "[[Episode 5: Polarized|Polarized]]" ==
She can briefly be seen in the [[San Francisco]] alternate reality, on the [[plane]] with Max.

She appears in [[Max's Nightmare|Max's nightmare]], leaning against the counter. This time she has a different hairstyle. It becomes apparent from her words that she has a husband and a newborn baby elsewhere, which explains her financial trouble. They will have to "go without her" unless Max decides to save Arcadia Bay.

If Max chooses to sacrifice Arcadia Bay, she is presumed to have died in the [[storm]].

== Symbolism ==
This woman and the old man can be considered opposites of each other in many ways:
# The man states he's going to be a millionaire, while the woman has trouble with money.
# The man brushes off Max's attempt to talk to him, while the woman is nice to Max and even thanks her for reassurance.
# Their genders are opposite.
It is probably not a simple coincidence that they are standing near each other.
