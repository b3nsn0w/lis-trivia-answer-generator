This article is a '''script''' for [[Episode 5: Polarized]].

== '''Dark Room''' ==
''[[Maxine Caulfield|Max]] wakes up tied to a chair in the [[Dark Room (Location)|Dark Room]]. If Max warned [[Victoria Chase|Victoria]] about the Dark Room in the [[Episode 4: Dark Room|previous episode]], she will be lying on the floor to Max's left, unconscious.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' [[Chloe Price|Chloe]]...? What? Where? The Dark Room...

'''Max:''' ''(shouting)'' Is anybody out there?! Please, help!

'''<u>Optional Conversation with Victoria</u>'''

'''Max:''' ''[turns to Victoria, panicked]'' Victoria...wake up. ''(fervently)'' Wake up!

''Victoria groans but doesn't wake up.''

''Max successfully detaches her right foot from the chair.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Finally! I'm free! Almost...

''Max uses her foot to pull the trolley in front of her. She then looks at a photo [[Mark Jefferson|Jefferson]] took of her.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' I hate looking at myself like that. You'll pay for this, Jefferson.

''Max focuses on the photo.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' I promised I would never go back in time like this again... But this is the only way...

==== '''First Focus''' ====
'''Jefferson:''' ''(during the focus)'' Oh, that's great... Oh, Max...

''Max wakes up lying on the ground with her hands tied, while Mr. Jefferson takes pictures of her.''

'''Jefferson:''' This angle highlights your purity, see? The slightly unconscious model is often the most open and honest. No vanity or posing just...pure expression.

''Jefferson moves Max's leg''

'''Mr. Jefferson:''' Oh Christ... Look at that perfect face.

''Max attempts to move her head, and Jefferson smacks her back into position.''

'''Jefferson:''' ''(shouting)'' Hold that stare there! ''(angrily)'' Stay still!

''Jefferson continues to take pictures. Max whimpers and tries to move.''

'''Jefferson:''' ''(shouting angrily)'' Oh, Max! You fucked up my shot! ''(calmly)'' But please don't worry, we have all the time in the world. For now. I knew you were special the second I saw your first..."selfie". Yes, I still hate that word. But I love the purity of your own image. Not like [[Rachel Amber|Rachel]], who was always looking in the wrong places. Poor Rachel. Wait... Let me try this angle.

''Jefferson steps over Max and continues to take pictures.''

'''Jefferson:''' Don't move!

''Jefferson positions Max's shoulder.''

'''Jefferson:''' Oh, much better... Thanks, Max. If only [[Nathan Prescott|Nathan]] could see this setup. He tried so hard, but you can't just throw a few subjects around and expect a cohesive style or theme. But he had an eye for shadows. And an eye for a whole lot more, as his [[Prescott Family|elite family]] will find out...along with [[Arcadia Bay]].

''Jefferson positions Max's head.''

'''Jefferson:''' Nice... Good... Oh, those eyes...

''Jefferson positions Max's shoulder again.''

'''Jefferson:''' It's just too bad you're so goddamn nosy, Max! But, this room...is under 24/7 surveillance, so all I had to do was text you from Nathan's phone, and you fell right into my hands. You really should have focused on schoolwork, not "private detecting" with your little...friend.

'''Max:''' Chloe...

'''Jefferson:''' Chloe, right. Yeah, I'm sorry I killed—that Nathan killed her in self-defense. But she had a troubled history like most Arcadia Bay dropouts. Nobody will be surprised...or care. Though I promise...people will care when you die tonight, Max. I wasn't lying when I said you have a gift.

''Jefferson crouches to take photos.''

'''Jefferson:''' Okay... Now, this looks good. Maybe a few more close-ups...

''Max moves her head, and Jefferson stands up again.''

'''Jefferson:''' Max, please do not move so much. I need you posed and framed my way! Maybe a new dose will calm you down...

'''Max:''' No, no... No...

''Max whimpers and struggles as Jefferson drags the trolley over.''

'''Jefferson:''' ''[fills the syringe with drugs from a vial]'' Now don't move, or this will...hurt...much.

''Max kicks the trolley away and the vials of drugs fall, one breaking and spilling liquid over a folder.''

'''Jefferson:''' ''(shouting angrily)'' Stupid bitch! You just don't listen, do you? ''(threateningly)'' In fact, you never did hear much in my class; if you had, you might have seen all this coming.

''Jefferson crouches down next to Max.''

'''Jefferson:''' ''(admiringly)'' Goddamn, you are a fighter, though. I've had my eye on you, and I have noticed that you've been more...fearless this week than maybe your whole life.

''Max struggles and shakes her head.''

'''Max:''' ''(mumbling quietly)'' No...

'''Jefferson:''' Remember my number one rule. Always...take...the shot.

''Jefferson injects the needle into Max. She struggles and cries out, then goes limp as she falls unconscious.''

==== '''After the Focus''' ====
'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Oh, Jesus... I can't believe that happened. So sick.

''If Victoria is in the Dark Room, Max glances at her as she groans and starts to stir.''

'''<u>Optional Conversation with Victoria</u>'''

'''Max:''' ''[turns to Victoria]'' Victoria? Hey, Victoria...it's Max. Can you hear me?

'''Victoria:''' Max... ''[panicked, on the verge of tears]'' Oh, God, where—where are we? Oh, what's happening?

'''Max:''' You've been drugged like Kate...and me. Do you remember how you got here?

'''Victoria:''' ''[panicked, on the verge of tears]'' No... I don't know... Wait... You warned me. You warned me about Nathan. Then I went to Jefferson for help, and he was acting so weird... That's the last thing I remember. And I can't move my hands! ''(crying, panicky)'' Help me, Max! Please, I'm sorry for everything!

'''Max:''' Listen carefully, Mark Jefferson kidnapped us. He's using Nathan as well. Jefferson is very dangerous, so we have to get out of here before he comes back.

'''Victoria:''' ''(crying)'' Max... I just can't believe this is real. I don't want to die like this! I'm only 18!

<tabber>I have a plan.=<h5 style="display:none">I have a plan.</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' Victoria...please, listen...I have a plan.

'''Victoria:''' Really? How? Max...I'm so scared.

'''Max:''' So am I. But...we don't have time to be scared. We have to fight back...now.

'''Victoria:''' ''(crying)'' Max...I can't even move my arms... How are we supposed to fight?

</blockquote>

|-|Ssshh!=<h5 style="display:none">Ssshh!</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' Ssh, Victoria! We don't want to bring Jefferson back... Please...let me think...

'''Victoria:''' Are you kidding?! We're fucking trapped!

'''Max:''' I know, I know...but we have to stay focused.

</blockquote>

|-|Nobody is going to die...=<h5 style="display:none">Nobody is going to die...</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' Just hold on, Victoria. Nobody is gonna die...anymore.

'''Victoria:''' Max, what's going on? I thought you said Nathan was dangerous, but it was actually Mark? Mr. Jefferson?

'''Max:''' I was wrong. ''[sighs]'' I should have known that Nathan couldn't do all this on his own.

'''Victoria:''' Do what? What's going to happen to us? Oh, please get us out of here!

</blockquote>

</tabber>

'''Max:''' I'm not going to let that asshole get away with this. I just... I need you to be strong. I can't do this alone. We need to act while we're clear-headed. If he doses us again, we'll forget everything.

<tabber>(Kate is alive)=<h5 style="display:none">(Kate is alive)</h5><blockquote>

'''Victoria:''' I'm not strong, Max. Look at me... Look what I did to [[Kate Marsh]]... Now she's in the hospital, and I'm here.

{{#tag:tabber|We're both here.=<h5 style="display:none">We're both here.</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' We're both here, okay?

'''Victoria:''' I just can't believe this is happening... That Jefferson would do this to me...to us...

</blockquote>

{{!}}-{{!}}We'll see her again.=<h5 style="display:none">We'll see her again.</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' Kate wants us to get the hell out of here...and then we can both go see her again, okay?

'''Victoria:''' I'd do anything to see Kate once more...just to tell her I'm sorry.

</blockquote>

}}

</blockquote>

|-|(Kate is dead)=<h5 style="display:none">(Kate is dead)</h5><blockquote>

'''Victoria:''' Then Kate Marsh was telling the truth... Even though I knew she wasn't lying... And I could've helped her Max...but I hurt her. ''(crying)'' Now it's—it's my turn.

{{#tag:tabber|We're both here.=<h5 style="display:none">We're both here.</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' We're both here, okay?

'''Victoria:''' I just can't believe this is happening... That Jefferson would do this to me...to us...

</blockquote>

{{!}}-{{!}}That's bullshit.=<h5 style="display:none">That's bullshit.</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' That's bullshit. Nathan and Jefferson killed Kate. And she deserves justice...

'''Victoria:''' I just can't believe Jefferson could do this... and I even blackmailed him into making me win the contest... I'm stupid, stupid, stupid!

</blockquote>

}}

</blockquote>

</tabber>

'''Max:''' Victoria, we will find a way to escape. I promise.

'''Victoria:''' Max...I believe you.

'''<u>Max and Victoria's Comments</u>'''

<tabber>(Kate is alive)=<h5 style="display:none">(Kate is alive)</h5><blockquote>

'''Victoria:''' ''(sobbing)'' Now I know what Kate had to go through...and I almost killed her...

'''Max:''' Shh. No, you didn't. Don't think about that now.

</blockquote>

|-|(Kate is dead)=<h5 style="display:none">(Kate is dead)</h5><blockquote>

'''Victoria:''' ''(sobbing)'' Now I know what Kate had to go through...and I helped kill her.

'''Max:''' You didn't know anything. Don't think about that now.

</blockquote>

</tabber>

'''Victoria:''' ''(tearfully)'' God, I was so fucking stupid...

'''Victoria:''' ''(tearfully)'' Please, get us out of here!

'''Max:''' I will... Just try to be calm...

'''Victoria:''' ''(sobbing)'' Please don't hate me... Please don't let me die in here...

'''Max:''' Victoria, nobody is dying in here. We will escape. I promise.

'''Victoria:''' ''(panicked)'' You have to get us out of here... You have to!

'''Victoria:''' ''(sobbing)'' Oh, Max... I'm so, so sorry... I had no clue...

'''Max:''' Neither did I...but we do now. I'll find a way out.

'''Victoria:''' Max... What can we do? What?

'''Max:''' Hold on, I'm thinking...

'''Victoria:''' Why is Mr. Jefferson doing this? Why?!

'''Victoria:''' ''(sobbing)'' This can't be real... I want to wake up...

'''Max:''' I need you to help me, okay?

'''Victoria:''' ''(sobbing)'' Max... You have to help us... you have to...

'''<u>Max's Thoughts</u>'''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' He drugged me for his fucked up binders...just to take photos...

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' I could try another photo... It makes me sick just thinking about him...

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Jefferson was too good to be true... How could I miss the signs?

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Okay, I changed some things... I could use some of these new pictures...

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' I can still get out of this and save Chloe... I have to.

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' How long has he been hiding all this?

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' You are not going to die in here...

''Max looks at another photo of herself on the trolley.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Whoa... I—I'm definitely more awake in this photo... I could try this one.

''Max focuses on the photo.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' This might work. Please work...

==== '''Second Focus''' ====
'''Jefferson:''' ''(during the focus)'' So wise yet so innocent...

''Max is still tied up in her chair while Mr.Jefferson takes photos of her from behind a camera mounted on a tripod.''

'''Jefferson:''' I'm getting some spectacular images here, Max. Yes, Victoria would kill to be in your place, but...she doesn't understand our...connection. You're the winner, Max. I choose you...your portrait.

'''Max:''' Fuck you.

'''Jefferson:''' You're trying too hard. I know you're scared... You all have the same doe-eyed look when you wake up here. Replaced by fear as you realize what's about to happen.

'''Max:''' Mr. Jefferson, why are you doing this?

''Jefferson steps away from the tripod and approaches Max.''

'''Jefferson:''' Oh, Max... I'm so glad you asked that question. Simply put, I'm obsessed with the idea of capturing that moment innocence evolves into corruption. That shift from black, to white, to grey, and beyond... Most models are cynical. They...lose that naiveté. However, some [[Blackwell Academy|Blackwell]] students carry their hope and...optimism with them like...an aura. And those lucky few become my models...my subjects.

'''Max:''' Yes, you're a psychopath. And this is your last session.

'''Jefferson:''' Au contraire, Max. I'm so sane, that nobody knows what's happening to you right now.

<tabber>(Victoria was kidnapped)=<h5 style="display:none">(Victoria was kidnapped)</h5><blockquote>

'''Jefferson:''' As you can see, Sleeping Beauty here is too harsh for my gentle lens.

</blockquote>

</tabber>

'''Jefferson:''' And don't get me started on your late partner. I had enough of those faux-punk sluts in my Seattle days.

<tabber>You killed Chloe.=<h5 style="display:none">You killed Chloe.</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' ''(angrily)'' You killed Chloe! You murdered my best friend.

'''Jefferson:''' She had a loaded weapon. This was clearly self-defense; but that's what happens when you play with guns...or try to fuck with me. It's better when they don't know...like pure...sweet...Kate.

</blockquote>

|-|Go to hell.=<h5 style="display:none">Go to hell.</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' Go to hell. You will, for everybody you've hurt.

'''Jefferson:''' Unlike pure, sweet Kate Marsh, I don't believe in that bullshit. She could have been my masterpiece. The world is what an artist makes it...and my muse—

</blockquote>

</tabber>
<tabber>Blah blah blah.=<h5 style="display:none">Blah blah blah.</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' Blah, blah, blah... God, I hate your voice now.

'''Jefferson:''' You might as well savor it, considering it's the last you'll hear. Oh... ''[chuckles]'' That struck a nerve. Your face changed color...beautiful.

</blockquote>

|-|Kate survived. (Kate is alive)=<h5 style="display:none">Kate survived. (Kate is alive)</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' Kate believed, and she survived. You failed to break her. She's stronger than ever. And she'll outlive you.

'''Jefferson:''' She'll certainly outlive you. ''[chuckles]'' Who knows? Maybe I'll pay Kate a visit soon and test her faith again...

</blockquote>

|-|Artists don't kill. (Kate is dead)=<h5 style="display:none">Artists don't kill. (Kate is dead)</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' Artists don't drive teenagers to suicide for any bullshit muse. You trained Nathan to drug Kate...to take photos of her. That's why she's dead.

'''Jefferson:''' Which makes me sad, Max. I will miss her... Kate had such a strong spirit...it was very satisfying to break it down.

</blockquote>

</tabber>

'''Max:''' ''(angrily)'' You will not get away with this. I want you to know that.

<tabber>(Blamed Jefferson)=<h5 style="display:none">(Blamed Jefferson)</h5><blockquote>

'''Jefferson:''' When you told the principal that I made Kate cry, I thought you almost had me. It's good our esteemed [[Raymond Wells|Principal Wells]] is like most administrators...a closet drunk.

</blockquote>

|-|(Blamed David)=<h5 style="display:none">(Blamed David)</h5><blockquote>

'''Jefferson:''' Then why did you blame [[David Madsen]] for stalking Kate? Of course, he was the only person who was about to find out the truth. Irony.

</blockquote>

|-|(Blamed Nathan)=<h5 style="display:none">(Blamed Nathan)</h5><blockquote>

'''Jefferson:''' Too bad you already made a convincing argument against Nathan in the [[Principal Wells' Office|Principal's office]]. Thank you so much for setting him up for me.

</blockquote>

</tabber>

'''Jefferson:''' I do know that the Prescotts are going to have a major scandal when the town finds out what their elite son has been doing for homework...

<tabber>You used Nathan.=<h5 style="display:none">You used Nathan.</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' You used Nathan.

'''Jefferson:''' I prefer the term "manipulated." Like with an image... Nathan's was easy to twist around.

</blockquote>

|-|He's as sick as you.=<h5 style="display:none">He's as sick as you.</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' He's as sick as you.

'''Jefferson:''' Don't...judge people, Max. But that's why Nathan never should have been at Blackwell...

{{#tag:tabber|You didn't care.=<h5 style="display:none">You didn't care.</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' You didn't care about him.

'''Jefferson:''' You're wrong again. He was genuinely talented. And [[Sean Prescott|his father]] is a serious asshole, as you might know...

'''Max:''' I know.

</blockquote>

{{!}}-{{!}}That makes two.=<h5 style="display:none">That makes two.</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' That makes two of you.

'''Jefferson:''' I helped Nathan realize his vision... So few people get that chance...

'''Max:''' You brainwashed him!

</blockquote>

}}

</blockquote>

</tabber>

'''Jefferson:''' I became a sort of...father figure for Nathan. It happens often in teacher/student relationships. It was kind of...touching, for a while.

'''Max:''' Did you tell him everything about your plans at Blackwell?

'''Jefferson:''' Don't be stupid, Max. I told him what he needed to hear. In return, I had access...to the Prescott fortune; who do you think paid for this glorious dark room and equipment? How else could I get all these hip, new drugs for my subjects?

'''Max:''' Rachel Amber was your victim, not your "subject".

'''Jefferson:''' ''(quietly)'' Oh...Rachel Amber... Hm. ''(normally)'' That's the real tragedy. Nathan thought he could be an artist like me...instead, the dumbass gave her an overdose.

<tabber>Why Rachel?=<h5 style="display:none">Why Rachel?</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' Why Rachel?

'''Jefferson:''' I don't have time to tell you everything. But she... was special. A human chameleon... So many visual possibilities... We had a real connection.

{{#tag:tabber|She let you take pictures?=<h5 style="display:none">She let you take pictures?</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' Did she let you... take pictures of her?

'''Jefferson:''' Rachel was in love with me. That's not my ego. Just look at our sessions. Not that I'll let you. Nobody loved having their picture taken more.

</blockquote>

{{!}}-{{!}}Did you know Frank?=<h5 style="display:none">Did you know Frank?</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' Did you know she also had a connection with Frank?

'''Jefferson:''' Let's be honest, she was doing the classic "bad boy" thing. She was over Frank before it began. He just didn't know.

</blockquote>

}}

</blockquote>

|-|Chloe and Rachel.=<h5 style="display:none">Chloe and Rachel.</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' Chloe and Rachel...you killed both of them!

'''Jefferson:''' They're fucking together in heaven right now. Is that what you wanna hear?

'''Max:''' Why? Why?!

'''Jefferson:''' ''(mockingly)'' "Why? ''[sniffles]'' Why?" ''(angrily)'' Start listening to me, you dumb cunt! ''(normally)'' I'm sorry, Max. ''[chuckles]'' That was not cool.

</blockquote>

</tabber>

'''Jefferson:''' Anyway, Rachel is dead. But no tears, [[Los Angeles]] would've killed her anyway, so, look at this as a favor.

'''Max:''' You're evil.

<tabber>(Max stopped Warren from beating Nathan)=<h5 style="display:none">(Max stopped Warren from beating Nathan)</h5><blockquote>

'''Jefferson:''' Oh, I see; you're "good" because you stopped [[Warren Graham|your friend]] from beating Nathan up.

</blockquote>

|-|(Warren beat up Nathan)=<h5 style="display:none">(Warren beat up Nathan)</h5><blockquote>

'''Jefferson:''' Oh, I see... You and your friends almost beat Nathan to death. You see, we're not so different.

'''Max:''' Yes, yes we are.

</blockquote>

</tabber>

'''Max:''' I cared more about Nathan than you did.

'''Jefferson:''' ''(angrily)'' No! You didn't. It's just too bad he fell in lust with Rachel; he actually thought he could mimic what I do with a camera and subject; like father, but not like son.

'''Max:''' Where is Nathan now?

'''Jefferson:''' Dead and buried. After what he did to Rachel, I knew I couldn't keep him as a protégé for much longer. Now the police will never find his body... Do you finally get it now, Max? I can't compromise my vision with amateurs.

'''Max:''' You are an amateur. Look at the trail of death you've left behind. You can't blame all this on Nathan! I don't care what you do to me. You're gonna die, motherfucker! For Chloe, and Rachel, and everybody else!

'''Jefferson:''' I do love your spirit, Max, but you brought yourself here, by your own choice. Anyway, I like my models to be seen and not heard...so I have to make sure...there's nothing left behind...of you.

''Jefferson goes over to the camera tripod.''

'''Jefferson:''' Okay. Now, let's see how these shots came out. I can see why your [[Max's Camera|instant camera]] is so appealing. ''[goes to the shelf and turns on stereo]'' You don't need a computer to print your work out.

''Jefferson goes to the back of the Dark Room to work on the photos.''

'''<u>Jefferson's Comments About the Photos</u>'''

'''Jefferson:''' Oh, now this one... This is purity personified...

'''Jefferson:''' Max...I wish you could see yourself now...

'''Jefferson:''' This one is out of focus... But that's my fault, Max.

'''Jefferson:''' God, I wish you had been around back in my day...

'''Jefferson:''' Your eyes are so wide... so lost... Beautiful.

'''Jefferson:''' Man, I would love to share this with the world...

'''Jefferson:''' Now look at this one... Total gallery bait...

'''Jefferson:''' It's too bad I'm the only one who can frame you...

'''Jefferson:''' Oh... now this is art...

'''<u>Max's Comments to Herself</u>'''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Sorry. This is not art...

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' If I talk to him... distract him... maybe he'll give up a photo.

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Come on, Max... Think, girl!

''Max looks at [[Max's Journal|her journal]] in the corner.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' I have all those photos in my diary... This could be a way out.

''Max rewinds and speaks to Jefferson as he turns to leave.''

'''Max:''' Wait! Please, Mr. Jefferson...

'''Jefferson:''' Max... ''[turns around to face her]'' I would love to talk shop, but I really need to go over these pictures. Especially while they're fresh in my mind... I think our session...was a career high for me...

<tabber>Let me go.=<h5 style="display:none">Let me go.</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' Let me go and I'll help you. Let me help you, please...

'''Jefferson:''' Don't beg! Never beg. I hate that. Anyway, let's enjoy our final moment, before I have to end our memorable session, with your death.

</blockquote>

|-|Show me the photos.=<h5 style="display:none">Show me the photos.</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' Could you... Could you show me the photos?

'''Jefferson:''' That's the first time one of my models down here has asked me that. Of course you would... But I love that the last thing you'll ever see is yourself...through my camera eye. Too perfect.

</blockquote>

|-|What are you going to do?=<h5 style="display:none">What are you going to do?</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' What... What are you going to do to me?

'''Jefferson:''' I'm going to make you live forever in my photographs. That's all that will be left of Maxine Caulfield. They won't even find your bag...

</blockquote>

|-|My diary. (Max looked at diary or Jefferson mentioned her bag)=<h5 style="display:none">My diary. (Max looked at diary or Jefferson mentioned her bag)</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' You...you still have my diary.

'''Jefferson:''' Don't worry...nobody's going to read it. Thanks for reminding me.

''Jefferson approaches Max's journal and picks it up.''

'''Jefferson:''' There's nothing more innocent than a teenager's diary. Oh...look at your selfies. What a waste of talent.

''Jefferson throws Max's journal to the floor and it opens to a page with a selfie of Max in the photography classroom.''

'''Jefferson:''' Look at that shot, Max... You can do so much better.

</blockquote>

</tabber>

''Jefferson walks away, turns on the stereo, and returns to looking at his photos of Max. Max looks down at her diary and focuses on her selfie.''

== '''Photography Lab''' ==
'''Victoria:''' ''(during focus)'' ...hopeless faces. You feel, like, totally haunted by the eyes of those sad mothers and children.

'''Jefferson:''' I could frame any one of you in a dark corner, and capture you in a moment of desperation. Sh, sh, sh. I believe Max has taken what you kids call a "selfie". A dumb word ''(in background as Max thinks to herself)'' for a wonderful photographic tradition. And Max...has a gift. Of course as you all know...

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' I'm back... Right back where I started this insane week... And nobody is going to hurt Chloe ever again...

'''Jefferson:''' ...the photo portrait has been popular since the early 1800s. Your generation was not the first to use images for "selfie-expression". Sorry. I couldn't resist. The point remains that the portraiture has always been a vital aspect of art, and photography, for as long as it's been around. Now, Max, since you've captured our interest and clearly want to join the conversation, can you please tell us the name of the process that gave birth to the first self-portraits?

<tabber>A real visionary.=<h5 style="display:none">A real visionary.</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' The Daguerreian Process. He was a real visionary...not a hypocrite.

'''Jefferson:''' Uh... ''[chuckles awkwardly]'' What do you mean by that?

'''Max:''' I mean that he actually created something. He didn't just take pictures of models and pretend they were art.

''Victoria turns in her seat to glare at Max, resting her arm on the back of her chair.''

'''Jefferson:''' I'm not sure I get the connection, but... Uh...yes. The Daguerreian Process made portraiture hugely popular, mainly because it gave the subjects clear, defined features. You can learn more when you actually finish reading the assigned chapters. Max has...clearly read more into them than...I have.

</blockquote>

|-|Daguerreian Process.=<h5 style="display:none">Daguerreian Process.</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' The Daguerreian Process.

'''Jefferson:''' Oh. Well...that was easy, Max.

'''Max:''' Was it? ''[scoffs]'' Okay.

''Victoria turns in her seat to glare at Max, resting her arm on the back of her chair.''

'''Jefferson:''' Well...uh... Okay, then. So, uh, the Daguerreian Process made portraiture hugely popular, mainly because it gave the subjects clear, defined features. You can learn more when you actually finish reading the assigned chapters. Obviously...Max has read them.

</blockquote>

|-|Not "capturing."=<h5 style="display:none">Not "capturing."</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' I'm not into "capturing" your interest. That's kind of sick, isn't it?

'''Jefferson:''' Uh... ''[chuckles awkwardly]'' I guess somebody hasn't had their coffee... Do you wanna try again?

'''Max:''' Okay, okay, the Daguerreian Process. ''[scoffs]'' Blah, blah, blah.

''Victoria turns in her seat to glare at Max, resting her arm on the back of her chair.''

'''Jefferson:''' Let's...let's move on, hm? Uh, anyway, so the Daguerreian Process made portraiture quite popular, mainly because it gave the subjects clear, defined features. You can learn more when you finish reading the assigned chapters.

</blockquote>

|-|Who cares?=<h5 style="display:none">Who cares?</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' Who cares? This class is hella bullshit.

'''Jefferson:''' I'll pretend you didn't say that, and let you try to answer one more...

'''Max:''' Sorry, there's no time left. I mean, your class is almost over.

''Victoria turns in her seat to glare at Max, resting her arm on the back of her chair.''

'''Jefferson:''' Oh... Well, uh... Thanks for the warning, Max. So, the Daguerreian Process made portraiture quite popular, mainly because it gave the subjects clear, defined features. You can learn more when you finish reading the assigned chapters. Clearly, Max doesn't have the, uh...time.

</blockquote>

</tabber>

''The school bell rings and the students begin collecting their things and leaving the room.''

'''Jefferson:''' And, guys, don't forget the deadline to submit a photo in the "Everyday Heroes" ''(in background as Max thinks to herself)'' contest. I'll fly out...

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Time to change time...

'''Jefferson:''' ...with the winner to [[San Francisco]] where you'll be feted by the ''(in background as Max thinks to herself)'' art world. It's great exposure and it can kickstart a career in photography. So...

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' First, let's make it real easy to capture Mark Jefferson.

'''Jefferson:''' ...Stella and Alyssa, get it together. Taylor, don't hide, I'm still waiting for your entry too. And, yes, Max, I see you pretending not to see me.

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Bastard. I have to warn David about Jefferson and the Dark Room.

''Max searches her bag and finds a pamphlet for Blackwell.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' ''[sighs]'' I should be able to track down David's number from the school pamphlet.

''Max flips through the pages until she finds David's number.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Found you!

''Max takes out her phone to text David.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' For once, David...I'm praying you'll overreact to this as much as everything else...and take Jefferson down fast.

'''Max (SMS):''' Mr. Madsen. You're after Rachel Amber. Mark Jefferson is guilty. His Dark Room is under the [[Prescott Barn|Prescotts' farmhouse]]. You know the location. He's sick and dangerous. Stop him.

''Max deletes her message after sending it and puts her phone in her pocket.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' You wanted me to enter the contest, asshole.

''Max grabs her bag and gets up from her seat.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' So maybe I'll be going to San Francisco. And, Jefferson...you'll be going to prison.

''Max's nose starts bleeding and she wipes the blood away.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' The past within the past... ''[sighs]'' Am I pushing myself too hard?

'''<u>Optional Conversation with Kate</u>'''

''Max approaches Kate and Kate looks up at her.''

'''Max:''' Hi, Kate...

'''Kate:''' Oh... Hey, Max.

'''Max:''' Kate, listen to me...

'''Kate:''' I am.

'''Max:''' Always remember that you're not alone. I've got your back, no matter what happens. So do a lot of other people. We all care. We're all here for you. You need to know that.

'''Kate:''' Max... That makes me feel so blessed for the first time this week... I...I don't know what to say...

'''Max:''' That's okay, neither do I. Maybe we could both use a hug.

''Kate gets up and she and Max hug.''

'''Kate:''' Thanks. You always know the right thing to do.

''Kate returns to her desk.''

'''<u>Conversation with Jefferson and Victoria</u>'''

'''Max:''' ''[crosses her arms]'' Mr. Jefferson? We need to talk.

'''Jefferson:''' Uh—

'''Victoria:''' Can you see I'm talking to Mr. Jefferson now?

<tabber>(Victoria was kidnapped)=<h5 style="display:none">(Victoria was kidnapped)</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' Yes, I see. But maybe you shouldn't...

'''Victoria:''' Uh, and why not?

'''Jefferson:''' Hold on, Victoria. Are you okay, Max?

'''Max:''' I will be when Victoria realizes that hiding behind a screen, posting videos of people is incredibly cruel and unfair. You're smart enough to know how easy it is to hurt somebody, to destroy their life. I just want you to think about how much it would hurt if somebody did that to you. You can always make the right choice, Victoria. I know you've got a good heart. I've seen it.

'''Victoria:''' Listen...I...I didn't...

'''Max:''' You don't have to explain. There's no reason for you to be so insecure you can't be happy with your own talent. Wouldn't it be better to lift people up than to bring them down? You could inspire people...

'''Victoria:''' Okay, I don't know what you're talking about now... Do I, Mr. Jefferson?

'''Jefferson:''' I think I should stay out of this one, Victoria.

'''Victoria:''' ''[crosses her arms]'' Then I guess I'm done talking.

'''Max:''' And that's okay too.

''Victoria leaves the classroom.''

'''Jefferson:''' That was kind of random, Max. What did you mean?

</blockquote>

|-|(Victoria wasn't kidnapped)=<h5 style="display:none">(Victoria wasn't kidnapped)</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' I can see you're kissing ass again. Nothing new.

'''Victoria:''' What did you just say?!

'''Jefferson:''' Hold on, Victoria. Are you okay, Max?

'''Max:''' Not until Victoria knows that hiding behind a screen and posting videos of people is totally fucked up. You know how easy it is to hurt somebody, to destroy their life? Are you proud of yourself? If you have any feelings left, you should think about your actions.

'''Victoria:''' Listen... ''[scoffs]'' I—I didn't...

'''Max:''' Of course you did! You're so insecure, you can't even be happy with your own talent. You have to try and bring everybody down to your mean and ugly lev—

'''Victoria:''' Okay, ''(angrily)'' I do not have to listen to this bullshit... Do I, Mr. Jefferson?

'''Jefferson:''' Well, it looks like you already did, Victoria.

'''Victoria:''' ''[crosses her arms]'' Then I guess I'm...done talking.

'''Max:''' I sure hope so.

''Victoria leaves the classroom.''

'''Jefferson:''' ''[chuckles]'' I'm not going to say I didn't enjoy that, but...why?

</blockquote>

</tabber>

''Max takes her selfie out and hands it to Jefferson.''

'''Max:''' Here's my photograph for the "Everyday Heroes" contest.

'''Jefferson:''' Oh, uh... That was easy.

'''Max:''' No... It wasn't easy at all.

'''Jefferson:''' Well, I, uh... I—I can't pre-judge yet, but I'm very...happy you decided to enter. That means a lot to me...and Blackwell. The—the first step for any artist is to put themselves out there, in the world, without fear. To be...innocent.

'''Max:''' Or guilty.

'''Jefferson:''' Uh... ''[chuckles awkwardly]'' Well... Thanks...for the photo. Maybe both of us will be jet-setting to San Francisco this Friday.

'''Max:''' Or maybe only one of us will be going.

'''Jefferson:''' Don't be so modest, Max. Anything can happen in a week...

'''Max:''' As you're going to find out, Mr. Jefferson.

''A [[Timestream|timestream montage]] shows Chloe in the bathroom with Nathan, Chloe and Max walking on the train tracks, [[Diner Cop|a cop]] eating breakfast being replaced by several cops investigating the Dark Room, Kate crying in the hallway replaced by Kate and the principal watching Jefferson being arrested, Kate on the roof replaced by the police discovering Rachel's body, Max with Chloe after finding Rachel's body replaced by Max winning the contest, Jefferson killing Chloe replaced by Chloe helping Max pack for San Francisco, and Jefferson taking pictures of Max replaced by Max getting into a taxi to go the airport.''

== '''Plane''' ==
''Max wakes up on the [[Plane|plane]]. Principal Wells is asleep in the aisle seat next to her.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Whoa!

''Max looks out the window at the wing of the plane.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Okay... You're okay, Max... You're safe...on a plane. I hope I did everything right this time.

''Max leans forward to look at the newspaper in front of Wells. The headline says "Local Teacher Arrested!".''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Good work, David.

''Max takes her phone out of her pocket to check her text messages.''

'''Chloe (SMS):''' HOLY SHIT YOU RULE MAX!!!!!

'''Chloe (SMS):''' i am so proud of my superstar

'''Chloe (SMS):''' this is just the start of your career

'''Max:''' Chloe... Oh, you're alive... Oh, you're alive. I did it... I fixed everything. Wowser.

''Max puts her phone away again and relaxes in the seat.''

'''Announcement:''' Please fasten your seat and stow any electronic gear until the plane is on the ground and at the gate. Thank you. We're starting our descent in a few minutes. It's a beautiful day in San Francisco with clear skies and cool 60 degrees. We hope you enjoyed your trip, and we thank you very much for choosing PacificWest Air. Come fly with us anytime.

'''Principal Wells:''' ''(groaning)'' Ah, I don't think so. I'm hoping these airline seats get smaller so I won't have to fly at all anymore.

'''<u>Conversation with Principal Wells</u>'''

'''Max:''' How did you sleep?

'''Principal Wells:''' Hope I wasn't snoring out loud, Max...

'''Max:''' Just a bit.

'''Principal Wells:''' It's...been a tough week at Blackwell, so I hope you'll forgive me. Between Mr. Jefferson and the Prescotts, things have been...hectic, to say the least.

'''Max:''' I totally get it, Principal Wells.

'''Principal Wells:''' That's a smart way of telling me to stop whining. We are proud of you for representing Blackwell at the "Everyday Heroes" contest. I know I'm not exactly the guide you wanted in San Francisco. But we all want you to have a great experience here.

'''Max:''' I already am, and we're not even there.

''Max's nose starts bleeding and she wipes away the blood.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Christ! Another nosebleed? Max...you're not just screwing around with time...

''The screen fades out. Another timestream montage appears: Max tied to a chair in the Dark Room is replaced by Max and Wells exiting the airport and getting into a taxi.''

== '''Zeitgeist Gallery''' ==
=== '''Ground Floor''' ===
''Max walks slowly near the entrance of the [[Zeitgeist Gallery|gallery]] and stares in awe at the people and pictures. Principal Wells is talking to the woman at the front desk. Max approaches him and touches his arm to get his attention, and he turns to face her.''

'''Max:''' San Francisco is so cool...and this gallery is huge!

'''Principal Wells:''' So is the buffet. If an event skimps on the food, you know it's a bad event.

'''Max:''' As long as I don't have to eat any caviar...

'''Principal Wells:''' This is your day, Max. You can do whatever you want. I hope you take advantage of your status and talk to as many influential people here as possible. Work the room.

'''Max:''' I don't know... I feel so weird, like I'm a little kid hanging with the adults.

'''Principal Wells:''' Max, after this week, you are certainly not a little kid anymore. In fact, you're a noteworthy adult being honored by your peers. Now, you have to start acting like the photographer you want to be. Hell, I wanted to be in charge of a big school someday, so I started taking charge of things when I was young. ''[chuckles]'' Ask my poor classmates... Max, I'm gonna eat up that caviar so you don't have to. Better get in there and start schmoozing. You know, I won't always be here to take charge. But you come talk to me, whenever you want.

''Principal Wells pats Max on the back, then leaves and walks toward the buffet table.''

'''Max:''' Come on, Max... After everything that's happened, this should be the least scary thing you've ever done.

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Wowser, Max... You did it. Somehow... I went from the Dark Room...to this gallery. I've been through so many realities in one week. Life is...weird.

'''<u>Optional Conversation with the Receptionist</u>'''

'''Receptionist:''' Why, good morning! You must be Max Caulfield. Congratulations for your "Everyday Heroes" photo! The exhibition is quite impressive, especially with your entry.

'''<u>Conversation Between Man and Woman Near Neon Art</u>'''

'''Man:''' I heard Mark Jefferson was supposed to be here tonight.

'''Woman:''' Not anymore.

'''Man:''' That was so shocking. I have one of his monographs too.

'''Woman:''' Hold onto it. His work is gonna be worth serious cash.

'''<u>Optional Conversation with Man Near Neon Art</u>'''

'''Man:''' Are you Max Caulfield? Bravo on your entry. I'm the art critic for Iris-In Magazine, and we would love to include you in a piece about future trendsetters in photography. I'll send you the details this week, if that's okay. Congratulations for your piece.

'''<u>Conversation Between Family Behind Everyday Heroes Board</u>'''

'''Man:''' Look at this print, the depth of field , the colors, look at the bokeh shape, this was definitely shot with a medium format camera, using a Leica 35mm lens. You can definitely find out those details, the story of a photo… if you know how to look at all the details of a picture.

'''Woman:''' ''(sarcastically)'' Ooh, this is so interesting Matthew, I didn't think you knew about all this.

'''Matthew:''' When I was younger I did a lot of photography studies, didn't I tell you about it Emma? I was quite good at it actually, but I decided to drop photography to do a real paying job... Anyway, it is interesting to be here, and you're lucky to be with me here, I can share all of this with you.

'''Girl:''' Errr Dad, the label says that this is a print from a disposable camera, what are you talking about?

'''Matthew:''' Oh, yes of course, I was meaning a Leica disposable camera… yes, yes… and don't contradict me anyway...

'''Girl:''' ''[scoffs]'' Whatever...

'''<u>Optional Conversation with Principal Wells</u>'''

''Max touches Wells' shoulder and he turns to face her.''

'''Principal Wells:''' So, how are you handling your new fame as a photographer?

'''Max:''' I don't feel like a famous photographer yet.

'''Principal Wells:''' Every journey starts with the first step. I'm only a Blackwell bureaucrat, not an artist, but you've made us proud with the great response to your work so far.

<tabber>I'm lucky.=<h5 style="display:none">I'm lucky.</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' I don't know... I—I'm just lucky. There's no way I'm a real photographer yet.

'''Principal Wells:''' Don't sell yourself short, Max.

</blockquote>

|-|It's surreal.=<h5 style="display:none">It's surreal.</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' It's kinda surreal to be here after everything that happened at Blackwell...

'''Principal Wells:''' All the more reason to celebrate your success.

</blockquote>

</tabber>

'''Max:''' Maybe I feel guilty for celebrating...

'''Principal Wells:''' Leave that to me. I...I should've been more proactive about Kate Marsh and her awful situation. She's strong, and I'm glad she made it out of that hell. I should've put my foot down with Nathan Prescott...or put my foot in his ass.

<tabber>Not your fault.=<h5 style="display:none">Not your fault.</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' It's not your fault. You didn't know what really happened...

'''Principal Wells:''' I know, but...that's not a good excuse for a principal.

</blockquote>

|-|Jefferson fooled us.=<h5 style="display:none">Jefferson fooled us.</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' Mark Jefferson was good at hiding his tracks... We were all fooled by him.

'''Principal Wells:''' Most of all, me. As you might know, I have a weakness for prestige.

|-|I tried to tell you. (reported Nathan)=<h5 style="display:none">I tried to tell you. (reported Nathan)</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' I did tell you that Nathan was involved...not that I expected anyone to believe me...

'''Principal Wells:''' I'll regret that for the rest of my life, Max. The Prescotts knew how to protect their own.

</blockquote>

|-|I should have told you. (hid the truth)=<h5 style="display:none">I should have told you. (hid the truth)</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' I should've told you that Nathan brought a gun to school this week. Maybe things would've been different.

'''Principal Wells:''' Maybe not. I probably wouldn't have believed that he did. The Prescotts have a way of getting their way...or should I say "had"?

</blockquote>

</tabber>

'''Principal Wells:''' And Jefferson had such a great reputation. Nobody expected him to be so...disturbed. I couldn't believe the police found those sick photos in his dark room. ''[sighs]'' Those poor girls...

'''Max:''' At least he's in jail along with Nathan for kidnapping and murder.

'''Principal Wells:''' And Sean Prescott is now under serious investigation for all his years of corruption. Money and power can only protect you for so long in Arcadia Bay. The irony is that, for once, Sean Prescott actually had no clue what was going on with Jefferson...and he even brought him to Blackwell.

<tabber>Strange weather.=<h5 style="display:none">Strange weather.</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' Now if we can just...figure out what's going on with the weather...maybe everything will be like it was before.

'''Principal Wells:''' Environmental science is above my paygrade, Max. But it sure would be nice to get back to Blackwell Academy the way it was before.

</blockquote>

|-|Maybe it's karma.=<h5 style="display:none">Maybe it's karma.</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' I—I'd like to think there's some karma involved... The Prescotts have had this coming.

'''Principal Wells:''' I do believe that what goes around, comes around. I just hope it's all good for a change.

</blockquote>

</tabber>

'''Max:''' I'm hoping this is a fresh start, Principal Wells.

'''Principal Wells:''' Like I said before, you're an adult now, Max. You can call me Ray now, at least for this event. Now, if you'll excuse me, I hear the buffet calling for me again...

'''<u>Conversation Between Man and Woman</u>'''

'''Man:''' I know it's kinda simple, but...I find this haunting.

'''Woman:''' Right? The instant print makes it look timeless... nostalgic melancholy.

'''Man:''' Who's the artist?

'''Woman:''' A teenage girl... I think it's for some contest.

'''Man:''' That's cool. Seems...pretty mature.

'''<u>Optional Conversation with Man</u>'''

'''Man:''' Oh, hey, you're the one who entered the self-portrait! Or, actually, do you call it a "selfie"? Anyway, I was very impressed about how you subverted it to make all of your photo subjects to focus... Huh! Very smart.

'''<u>Comment From Woman in Striped Stockings</u>'''

'''Woman:''' Like...I do not understand art.

'''<u>Optional Conversation with Man in Striped Shirt</u>'''

'''Man:''' Well, I have to say, this is the best "Everyday Heroes" show I've seen since it began. All the pictures say a lot about our times... Bravo.

'''<u>Comments From Woman in Red Jacket</u>'''

'''Woman:''' How much would you pay for that?

'''Woman:''' I guess everybody is a photographer now...

'''<u>Optional Conversation with Woman with Red Socks</u>'''

'''Woman:''' Um, excuse me. I—I just wanted to tell you how much I loved your photograph. I've seen a lot today, but there's something...powerful and understated in yours. I can't wait to see much more of your work in the future.

'''<u>Optional Conversation with Journalist</u>'''

'''Journalist:''' Hi, e—excuse me. You're Max Caulfield, right?

'''Max:''' Um...yeah. Yes...

''He shakes Max's hand.''

'''Journalist:''' Sorry to bother you, but my name is [[Daniel Lee|Danny Lee]] and I'm with the Berkeley People's Herald. I edit their art section and I totally dig your work. Now, I know the whole "ironic selfie" thing is kind of...played out, but there's something...timeless about your images. So, I—I'd love to set up an appointment or—or interview with you when you get a chance. Uh, here's my card. ''[hands Max his business card]'' So great talking with you, Max.

'''Max:''' You too, Danny.

'''<u>Comment From Man with Gray Jacket</u>'''

'''Man:''' Bad exposure...bad framing...bad picture. I could've done this so much better.

'''<u>Comment From Man with Orange Vest</u>'''

'''Man:''' This makes me feel so sad... Like I was back in high school...

'''<u>Optional Conversation with Man in Orange Vest</u>'''

'''Man:''' Usually, these kinda contests, they, uh, they put me to sleep, but I like how this show is about specific actions, you know, not just...abstractions. The Zeitgeist is doin' some unique stuff this year.

'''<u>Comment From Woman in Purple Jacket</u>'''

'''Woman:''' I always get so inspired whenever I come here.

'''<u>Optional Conversation with Woman in Purple Jacket</u>'''

'''Woman:''' Hey, I love your shot. I just wanted to say congratulations, and I hope you get a lot more attention.

'''<u>Comment From Man in Dark Suit</u>'''

'''Man:''' I wonder if I can buy these "Everyday Heroes" pictures...

'''<u>Optional Conversation with Man in Dark Suit</u>'''

'''Man:''' Sorry, I don't know your name, but I saw your picture in the gallery brochure and, uh, I just wanted to let you know how cool your entry was.

'''Woman:''' God....I love art.

'''<u>Optional Conversation with Woman in Green Jacket</u>'''

'''Woman:''' You must be the Everyday Hero from Blackwell... My name is Lauren Francis and I run the media department at Detroit School of Visual Arts. I'd love to talk about you being a residency next spring... ''[inhales]'' Don't say anything to Principal Wells... ''[scoffs]'' Yet.

'''<u>Comment From Man in Dark Blue Jacket</u>'''

'''Man:''' How do these galleries afford to rent here?

'''<u>Conversation Between Group By Max's Photo</u>'''

'''Woman:''' It is different... Loving the retro vibe.

'''Man:''' Me too. Makes me wanna go buy an instant camera. Damn, I bet that film costs a fortune.

''Max looks at her photo.''

'''Woman:''' Hey, and there she is to save the day.

'''Max:''' Hi.

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' You did it, Max... You're a real artist. At least...for today...

''Max's nose starts to bleed. She grasps her head in her hands as visions of the storm flash and swirl.''

'''Chloe:''' ''(faintly, echoing)'' Max!

''Max awakes from her vision.''

'''Max:''' Chloe!

'''Woman:''' Hey, are you okay? We lost you there for a second...

'''Man:''' Uh, your nose!

'''Max:''' I'm okay... Uh, jet lag... High altitude...

''Max walks away and the group watches her with concern.''

=== '''Lower Floor''' ===
''Max sits down on one of the benches, holding her phone.''

'''Max:''' ''[sighs]'' You left the ringer off, idiot!

''Max sees that she has 6 missed calls from Chloe. She dials her number and lifts the phone to her ear.''

'''Max:''' ''[sighs]'' ''(worriedly)'' Come on... Please answer...

'''Chloe:''' ''(over phone, scared)'' Max! Holy shit, man! Your vision! It's...it's true! Y—you saw the tornado, it's coming!

'''Max:''' What?! Oh, no... Chloe, where are you?

'''Chloe:''' ''(over phone, scared)'' I'm so fucking scared! I'm...I'm by the beach, I—I'm stuck in the t—ah—!

''Chloe's voice cuts off and there is silence on the phone.''

'''Max:''' ''(worriedly)'' Chloe! Can you hear me? Hello? Hello?!

''Max puts her phone back in her jacket and gets up.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Oh, my god, ''[sighs]'' the tornado was real! ''[sighs frustratedly]'' Oh, I didn't fix shit! Chloe will die... Arcadia Bay is gonna be destroyed... There has to be a way to stop this...for good!

=== '''Upper Floor''' ===
''Max returns to her photo and attempts to focus on it. The longer it takes her to focus, the more people will interrupt her.''

''She is interrupted by a man trying to talk to her.''

'''Man:''' Excuse me, I'd love to ask you a few questions about your work?

'''Max:''' Sorry, but...

''Max resumes her focus. She is interrupted again, this time by a woman wearing glasses.''

'''Woman:''' Oh, you're Max Caulfield, right? Tell me what kind of instant camera you used!

'''Max:''' Can we talk later? Thanks...

''Max attempts to focus again.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' I literally do not have the time to deal with everybody...

''Another man tries to talk to Max.''

'''Man:''' Oh, hey... I totally am into your photography.

'''Max:''' Not right now...

''Max resumes focusing.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Focus, Max! Chloe needs you now!

''A woman interrupts Max.''

'''Woman:''' Oh, my gosh! ''[gasps]'' Can I pick your brain for an hour?

'''Max:''' Thanks, but I—I'm busy...

''Max tries to focus again.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Zen, Max, zen... ''[sighs]'' There's nobody here but you...nobody...

== '''Max's Room''' ==
''A camera flash goes off. Max stands in her room, in front of her [[The Max Caulfield Photo Memorial Wall|wall of photos]]. Her nose starts bleeding again.''

'''Max:''' Oh, shit! Oh, my head...

''Max looks at her room; the walls are red and yellow blobs, shifting and moving.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' What is going on now? I—It feels like reality is...breaking apart... ''[shaky breath]'' What am I doing to time?

''Max looks at the polaroid photo she just took.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' I just have to make one simple change...so I won't end up in San Francisco. ''[sighs]'' Simple...

''Max tears up her contest photo.''

'''Max:''' Sorry, San Francisco... Chloe comes first.

''A timestream montage is shown. Max holding up the winning contest photo is replaced with Max putting the torn photo in her diary. Max getting into a taxi is replaced with Jefferson burning Max's diary. Max entering a taxi with Wells is replaced by Max tied to a chair in the Dark Room.

''Max wakes up in the Dark Room, tied to the chair.''

''Jefferson stands over Max, his arms crossed.''

'''Jefferson:''' What did you say, Max?

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' What?! Jefferson should be in jail, not here...

'''Jefferson:''' Jesus. It's like you're back in my class. You're still...spacing...out. It might be cool if you took one of your patented selfies now... The transformation between the old Max and the new Max...

''Max's right foot is shown to be free from the restraint. Max's fearful and confused expression turns to a scowl.''

'''Max:''' ''(horrified)'' No...

'''Jefferson:''' Your iris... That...dilation like a shutter...the pictures you're taking of me now. Too bad you pissed away your gift. You could have won the contest, but you destroyed your own beautiful photograph. What a waste. Sorry. I burned all your stuff. I got a little carried away.

''Max looks over to see the burned remains of her journal in a tray on the trolley.''

'''Jefferson:''' ''(in background)'' You know, I always believed in your vision.

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Fuck! He burned my diary! That's why I'm still here.

'''Jefferson:''' Whoa! Did you see how crazy it is outside? Like I said...something weird... There's that fear... Oh, Max... It's an honor working with you on these final sessions.

'''<u>Chloe's Truck</u>'''

'''Chloe:''' After five years you're still Max Caulfield.

'''Max:''' I am seriously glad to see you.

'''Chloe:''' Welcome home, Max. Fasten your seatbelt.

'''<u>William's Camera</u>'''

'''Chloe:''' I, uh... know it was your birthday last month... This was my real father's camera... I want you to have it.

'''Max:''' Yes, of course it's cool! Thank you... This camera is so sweet.

'''Chloe:''' Now that we got the mushy shit out of the way, I feel like stage diving! Let's thrash this place! Yep, yep! I'm fucking insane in the brain! Let's dance! Shake that bony white ass! Or take my picture with your new camera!

'''<u>Hiding from David</u>'''

'''Chloe:''' This song fucking rules! Can't dance, hippie? Come on! Rawk out, girl! Yo, turn it off, turn it off! You need to hide. Now! My stepdad will kill me if he finds you here!

'''<u>The Cliff</u>'''

'''Chloe:''' You were here today, Max. You saved me! I'm still tripping on that... Seeing you after all these years feels like—

'''Max:''' Destiny?

'''Chloe:''' If this is destiny, I hope we can find Rachel. I miss her, Max. What the hell is this?

'''Max:''' Snowflakes... Or a storm is coming.

'''Chloe:''' Max, start from the beginning. Tell me everything...

'''<u>The Two Whales Diner</u>'''

'''Chloe:''' Let's talk about your superpower... Epic! I pledge allegiance to Max and the power for which she stands... You can rewind time, Max. That's fucking insane. We have to play! You need a sidekick to guide you.

'''Max:''' Okay, Girl Wonder... Show me the way to Chloe's Cave.

'''<u>The Junkyard</u>'''

'''Chloe:''' Welcome to American Rust, my home away from Hell.

'''Max:''' Raw and rough. It suits you...

'''Chloe:''' Max, do you know how awesome this is? I get my best friend back and she's also supersized?

'''Max:''' I... don't... feel so super...

'''Chloe:''' Max, here let me help you find a place to chill... You freaked me out there. Do you feel any better now?

'''<u>Walking on the Railroad Tracks</u>'''

'''Chloe:''' You saved me again. Crazy. Now we're totally bonded for life! Since you're the mysterious superhero... I'll be your faithful chauffeur and companion.

'''Max:''' My powers might not last, Chloe.

'''Chloe:''' That's okay—we will. Forever.

'''<u>Busting into the Principal's Office</u>'''

'''Max:''' I'm so glad you're my partner in crime.

'''Chloe:''' As long as you're my partner in time. I might get on the other side of that door before you, Lupin.

'''Max:''' The race is on. See you soon. Welcome to my domain.

'''Chloe:''' You are magic. I have no clue how the hell you got in there, but you did it, sista.

'''<u>Looking Through the Principal's Files</u>'''

'''Chloe:''' Max, you better come check out these files...

'''Max:''' It's not a drawing... look, "Rachel in the dark room... Rachel in the dark room..." Over and over. That's it. No, you are not taking the cozy chair.

'''Chloe:''' Max, do your powers include mind-reading? Or did you just rewind because I tried to steal the chair? Shit, I'm confused.

'''Max:''' It's the powers of best friendship. I know how you roll...

'''<u>Swimming in the Blackwell Pool</u>'''

'''Max:''' Cowabunga!

'''Chloe:''' Why, look! An otter in my water! Your power is changing everything, Max. Especially you. I can already tell. You're not so chickenshit anymore.

'''Max:''' Thanks, girlfriend.

'''Chloe:''' And you make me feel like I have a reason for still being in Arcadia Bay.

'''<u>Fleeing Blackwell Security</u>'''

'''Max:''' Let's call it a draw. I'm gonna freeze my ass off when I get out...

'''Chloe:''' You look cute with your hair soaked in chemicals.

'''Max and Chloe:''' ''[to each other]'' Hide!

'''Chloe:''' You can't go back to your dorm now, you're a Blackwell fugitive! Crash at my place tonight.

'''<u>Waking Up in Chloe's Room</u>'''

'''Chloe:''' Photobomb!

'''Max:''' Photo-hog! It feels like a different world from yesterday...

'''Chloe:''' We left a skid mark on Blackwell last night.

'''Max:''' Wish we could just hang out all morning like we used to... Maybe we should get up, I have to get back to Blackwell soon.

'''<u>Frank's RV</u>'''

'''Chloe:''' Oh, we could totally cruise everywhere in this bad boy! Can you see us heading down the coast to Big Sur or beyond? I know. Just daydreaming. It makes me ill that Rachel posed like this for Frank... or wrote him love letters... I can't believe she was banging Frank! Rachel straight up lied to my face! Why didn't she say anything?

'''Max:''' Because she knew how you would react.

'''Chloe:''' Then she wasn't much of a friend, huh? Just another person who shits all over me. Why does everybody in my life let me down? My dad gets killed, you bail on me for years, my mother gloms onto step-fucker... now Rachel betrays me...

'''<u>Saving William</u>'''

'''Chloe:''' Not until I see it first! You know the rules, Dad! Dude, I am so lucky that my father is cool... Max, you are being so fucking strange. You feel okay?

'''Max:''' Chloe, I am... awesome. We are awesome!

'''<u>The Beach with Alternate Chloe</u>'''

'''Alternate Chloe:''' It’s weird hanging out with you again.

'''Max:''' I know... I’m glad we are, though.

'''Alternate Chloe:''' Look, the worst thing you can do is treat me like a baby. I still want to laugh and talk shit with my best friend. Can we stop? This is seriously the best view of the sunset. What do photographers call that?

'''Max:''' "The golden hour."

'''<u>Alternate Chloe's Room</u>'''

'''Alternate Chloe:''' Whoa, awesome picture. We look so badass in our pirate gear.

'''Max:''' We should have taken over Arcadia Bay when we had the chance.

'''Alternate Chloe:''' Listen, Max, my respiratory system is failing and... and it's only getting worse. I've heard the doctors talking about it when they thought I was zonked out. So I know I'm just putting off the inevitable, while my parents suffer along... and I will, too. This isn't how I want things to end.

'''Max:''' What? What are you saying?

'''Alternate Chloe:''' I'm saying that being with you again has been so special. I just wanted to feel like when we were kids running around Arcadia Bay... and everything was possible. And you made me feel that way today. I want this time with you to be my last memory... Do you understand?

'''<u>Working on the Detective Board</u>'''

'''Max:''' Chloe... you're back. I'm just... I'm just—I'm so glad you're here!

'''Chloe:''' You sound high, but thanks for the morning grope. Since we were up all night playing "CSI: Arcadia Bay," I was still spaced out here, trying to put all this info together.

'''<u>The Dark Room</u>'''

'''Max:''' Kate wasn't the first... All those binders are filled with other victims. Victoria has to be next. Nathan must be planning to dose her tonight at the Vortex Club party.

'''Chloe:''' Rachel... This can't be real... These are all—these are all posed shots, right? Right? The junkyard! Max, we have to find that spot, now! Then we can see what he did... There's no way she's dead. No way! She posed for those pictures, Max. I know it, please... let's go.

'''<u>Finding Rachel's Body</u>'''

'''Chloe:''' ''(sobbing)'' Rachel... Oh, Rachel... No... no... Please, not her...

'''Max:''' Chloe...

'''Chloe:''' Rachel... why?

'''Max:''' ''(sobbing)'' I’m sorry, Chloe. I’m so sorry...

'''Chloe:''' I loved her so much... How can she be dead? What kind of world does this? Who does this?!

'''<u>Reaching the Lighthouse</u>'''

'''Chloe:''' Come on Max, we’re almost there! Please wake up! Max, can you hear me? Hang on, Max, we can make it! Listen to me! Max! We’re near the lighthouse! Wake up! Dammit, Max, don't let me down!

''Max fights her way through the storm and catches up to reality.''

'''Chloe:''' Max, come on now! Don't worry... we'll be okay.

== '''Cliff''' ==

''Chloe and Max fall to the ground. The lighthouse is behind them.''

'''Chloe:''' Max? Max, can you hear me? Please, say something.

'''Max:''' Chloe? I... I must have passed out... Sorry.

'''Chloe:''' Oh, thank God... Don't you ever do that again, okay?

'''Max:''' I swear... but that nightmare was so real... was so horrible...

''Chloe takes Max's arm and they stand up. Max watches the tornado, horrified.''

'''Max:''' This is my storm. I caused this... I caused all of this. I changed fate and destiny so much that... I actually did alter the course of everything. And all I really created was just death and destruction!

'''Chloe:''' Fuck all of that, okay? You were given a power. You didn't ask for it... and you saved me. Which had to happen, all of this did... except for what happened to Rachel. But without your power, we wouldn't have found her! Okay, so you're not the goddamn Time Master, but you're Maxine Caulfield... and you're amazing. Max, this is the only way.

''Chloe hands Max the photo she took of the blue butterfly.''

'''Max:''' I feel like I took this shot a thousand years ago.

'''Chloe:''' You... You could use that photo to change everything right back to when you took that picture... All that would take is for me to... to... ''[Chloe holds her face in her hands]''

'''Max:''' Fuck that! No... no way! You are my number one priority now. You are all that matters to me.

'''Chloe:''' I know. You proved that over and over again... even though I don't deserve it. I'm so selfish... not like my mom... Look what she had to give up and live through... and she did. She deserves so much more than to be killed by a storm in a fucking diner. Even my step... father deserves her alive. There's so many more people in Arcadia Bay who should live... way more than me...

'''Max:''' Don't say that... I won't trade you.

'''Chloe:''' You're not trading me. Maybe you've just been delaying my real destiny... Look at how many times I've almost died or actually died around you. Look at what's happened in Arcadia Bay ever since you first saved me. I know I've been selfish, but for once I think I should accept my fate... our fate...

'''Max:''' Chloe...

'''Chloe:''' Max, you finally came back to me this week, and... you did nothing but show me your love and friendship. You made me smile and laugh, like I haven't done in years. Wherever I end up after this... in whatever reality... all those moments between us were real, and they'll always be ours. No matter what you choose, I know you'll make the right decision.

'''Max:''' Chloe... I can't make this choice...

''Chloe grabs Max's arms.''

'''Chloe:''' No, Max... You're the only one who can.

''Chloe hugs Max tightly.''

'''Chloe:''' I know, Max. But we have to. We have to save everybody, okay? And you'll make those fuckers pay for what they did to Rachel. Being together this week... it was the best farewell gift I could have hoped for. You're my hero, Max.

'''Chloe:''' I'll always love you... Now, get out of here, please! Do it before I freak. And Max Caulfield? Don't you forget about me...

'''Max:''' Never.

''Max focuses on the photo and travels back in time. She takes the freshly printed photo from her camera and tosses it to the floor. She looks around the stall and waits for the bathroom door to open.''

'''Nathan:''' ''[talking to himself in the mirror]'' It's cool, Nathan... Don't stress, you're okay, bro, just... count to three. Don't be scared. You own this school... If I wanted, I could blow it up. You're the boss.

''The blue butterfly lands on the edge of the sink near Nathan. Chloe enters the bathroom.''

'''Nathan:''' So what do you want?

'''Chloe:''' I hope you checked the perimeter, as my step-ass would say. ''[She opens the stall doors]'' Now, let's talk bidness.

'''Nathan:''' I got nothing for you.

'''Chloe:''' Wrong. You got hella cash.

''Max sinks to the floor.''

'''Nathan:''' You don't know who the fuck I am or who you're messing around with!

'''Chloe:''' Where'd you get that? What are you doing? Come on, put that thing down!

'''Nathan:''' Don't EVER tell me what to do. I'm so SICK of people trying to control me!

'''Chloe:''' You are going to get in hella more trouble for this than drugs.

'''Nathan:''' Nobody would ever even miss your punk ass, would they?

'''Chloe:''' Get that gun away from me, psycho!

''Nathan accidentally pulls the trigger. Max lowers her head and her tears fall to the floor. Nathan, distressed, shakes Chloe repeatedly. The song [[Spanish Sahara]] begins to play.''

''A timestream montage shows Chloe hovering over Nathan in the bathroom replaced by David handcuffing him, Nathan beating up Warren in the parking lot replaced by Nathan being interrogated by a police officer, Max taking a photo of Chloe dancing replaced by Max and some other students watching Mr. Jefferson be arrested, Chloe and Max walking on the train tracks replaced by Max holding Joyce's hands, Chloe splashing Max in the Blackwell pool replaced by Max hugging a teddy bear in her dorm room, Chloe and Max taking a selfie in Chloe's room replaced by Joyce giving Max a box of Chloe's things at the Two Whales Diner, Max hugging Chloe after returning from the alternate timeline replaced by Max looking at her polaroids, and Chloe and Max on the cliff during the tornado replaced by Max wearing a black dress and looking at the sunset.''

''Joyce, David, Principal Wells, Max, and some other Blackwell Academy students walk into the Arcadia Bay Cemetery and gather around Chloe's coffin. Frank and Pompidou also watch the funeral service from a distance. The blue butterfly lands on the coffin and Max smiles.''

'''Chloe:''' Max... it's time...

''The song [[Obstacles]] begins to play.''

'''Max:''' Not anymore.

''Max tears apart the polaroid and it blows away in the storm. She watches the tornado.''

'''Chloe:''' Max... I'll always be with you.

'''Max:''' Forever...

''Chloe holds Max's hand and they watch as the tornado hits Arcadia Bay. Max shakes her head and Chloe wraps her arm around Max.''

''A series of aerial shots show the wreckage. Chloe's truck comes into view as she drives down the street. Max looks out the window, upset; Chloe looks over at Max and stops the truck, squeezing her shoulder reassuringly, and Max smiles. The two girls drive out of town, passing the "Another Great Day in Arcadia Bay" sign.''
