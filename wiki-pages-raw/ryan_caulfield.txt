'''Ryan Caulfield''' is [[Maxine Caulfield|Max Caulfield]]'s father. Once a resident of [[Arcadia Bay]], he now resides in [[Seattle]] with Max's mother, his wife [[Vanessa Caulfield]].

== Personality ==
Max's father is very close to her - the two attending sports events together. He's presented as a very loving father figure. He doesn't seem to be as concerned as Max's mother about [[Blackwell Academy]].

In a [[Max's Messages#Dad|text message]] regarding Max's eighteenth birthday, he says that she is an adult now but still their little girl and shouldn't blow the money they'd sent her at once.

He is concerned about the threat he gets from an unknown number in [[Episode 4: Dark Room|Episode 4]] and [[Max's Messages#Dad_3|messages]] Max about it.

In another [[Max's Messages#Dad_4|text message]] to Max in the changed reality where Max has won the [[Everyday Heroes Photo Contest]], he points out that Max is an adult now and can tell her mother that she doesn't need to be too worried regarding the arrest of [[Mark Jefferson]] and [[Nathan Prescott]].

== Alternative Timeline ==
In the [[Alternative Timeline (Life is Strange)|alternative timeline]], Ryan and Vanessa sent [[Chloe Price]] a postcard, giving their best to her.
