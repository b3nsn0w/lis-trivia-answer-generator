== Trivia ==
* The Limited Edition Soundtrack album uses the radio edit of "Are You Ready For Me," with the profanity in the chorus muted, while the game itself uses the uncensored version, both when it's played live and heard over the radio.
* The song "Dreams of William" was called "With Without" at some point. The name can be seen in the [https://youtu.be/JbFBVFL7sq8?t=17s Deluxe Edition announcement trailer] and as an internal name "Daughter-WithWithout".<ref>[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/7bhz9v/all_wait_what_is_this_like_some_sorta_secret/ Reddit post by /u/lawlavch33]</ref>
