= Interestingly Reused Assets (Before the Storm) =


Many of the '''game assets''' from ''[[Life is Strange]]'' by [[Don't Nod]] were reused in ''[[Life is Strange: Before the Storm]]'' by [[Deck Nine Games]]. This article lists some interestingly reused game assets.

== Episode One - "[[Episode 1: Awake|Awake]]" ==

=== License Plate ===
The '''978 AM''' license plate was originally seen in [[David Madsen]]'s [[David's Garage|garage]] in ''Life is Strange''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> [[Episode 2: Out of Time|second episode]]. In ''Before the Storm'', the same plate appears in the [[Old Mill]] behind the bar area.<ref group="note">A dirtier version of the plate could also be found in the [[Hideout|hideout]] at the [[American Rust Junkyard|junkyard]] in the original game. The 978 AM plate was one of the few plates in ''Life is Strange'' which did not appear to be [[References (Life is Strange)|referencing]] a famous TV show. As this particular plate is being reused at this location, this may be causing a minor inconsistency between ''Before the Storm'' and ''Life is Strange''.</ref>
