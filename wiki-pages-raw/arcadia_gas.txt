It is frequented by both [[Nathan Prescott]] and [[Mark Jefferson]] and remains unexplorable throughout the game.

== Significance ==
While examining [[Investigation Files|evidence]] in [[Episode 4: Dark Room|Episode 4]], it is revealed, with some digging, that on October 4, the night [[Kate Marsh]] got drugged, both Nathan and Mr. Jefferson were seen at the gas station within minutes of each other.

== Trivia ==
* The gas station's logo could be a reference to the {{Wiki|Elf Aquitaine}}'s logo (a French oil company which used to be one of the biggest in France).
* The prices listed for the gas station are said to be realistic for the 2013 time period.
* The gas station's price board design (including its prices) are believed to be based on a real price board image that is used on a [https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/gasprices/ U.S. government source for fuel economy information] and is the second Google Images result for "gas prices".
