=== Welcome Message ===
The book features a "Welcome Message" written by [[Sean Prescott]] who is introduced as a "pillar of the community".

{{Bigquote
|"Welcome, one and all, to Arcadia Bay, the jewel of the Oregon Coast. My family may have been here since the town's founding, but one trait that every resident of this wonderful locale has always shared is their willingness to welcome new faces into the fold. From the Native Americans that originally called our sheltered bay home, to the town's proud residents today, we're always happy to see new people and invite them to enjoy our community.

Students are always especially welcome in Arcadia Bay--and not just because they bring outside money into the town! They also bring their curiosity, their passion, and their desire to make the world a better place. That's something the people of Arcadia Bay appreciate more than anything. In fact, that's exactly why Jeremiah Blackwell founded the school that bears his name one hundred years ago.

While Blackwell Academy may be the biggest draw for students admitted to that most prestigious school, Arcadia Bay itself has plenty of charms to enjoy, both for students and their visiting families. We have beaches on one side of us and mountains on the other, with miles of parkland all around. We have a charming main drag downtown, at which you can find everything from quaint shops and restaurants to upscale dining options too.

This is a wonderful place not just to go to school, but to vacation in as well. And most of all. it's a fantastic place to live. Peaceful, gorgeous, and full of kind people with ambitions beyond the borders of their homes. Join us here for a while and see if you don't agree."}}

== Lore Expansion ==
Taking artistic freedom, the book is expanding on the already established lore in ''[[Life is Strange]]'' by [[Don't Nod]] and its prequel ''[[Life is Strange: Before the Storm]]'' created by [[Deck Nine Games]].

Additions made by author Matt Forbeck include:
* Custodian Samuel graduated from Blackwell Academy in 1978 and has been working there as a custodian for 20 years.
* Victoria was born in Seattle, but her family originally is from Manhattan, and they get back there "as often as possible."
* Victoria also is, next to the Vortex Club, a member of the Photography and French clubs at Blackwell Academy, and likes swimming.
* Mayor Cochran was originally mentioned in ''Life is Strange'', the guide assigned the mayor a first name and the female gender.

=== Possible Inconsistencies ===
* Victoria's student profile states that she lives off-campus, which has never been stated and is very unlikely since her family lives in Seattle. In the original ''Life is Strange'', Victoria also has a dorm room.
* On their student profiles, every student answers the question 'Why did you come to Blackwell Academy?'. Even though the central motivation for Victoria to come to Blackwell was Mr. Jefferson lecturing there, as established in the original ''Life is Strange'', Victoria doesn't mention him at all in that section.
* Nathan's student profile states that he was born in Arcadia Bay, but according to his student file in the Principal's office, he was born in Fort Lauderdale (Florida).
* (TBC)

== Trivia ==
* The credits include Claudia Leonardi, the artist that works on the [[Life is Strange (Comic Series)|''Life is Strange'' comic series]], Scott Blows and Roxane Domalain, the brand managers for the ''Life is Strange'' franchise at Square Enix.
* Author Matt Forbeck dedicates the book to his wife Ann and his kids Marty, Pat, Nick, Ken and Helen who "loved Arcadia Bay so much, that they insisted [he] visit[s it]."
* The "Map of Arcadia Bay" pages feature a reference to the 2009 horror thriller ''{{Wiki|The Last House on the Left}}''.
* The [https://twitter.com/mforbeck/status/1034553957371322371 author stated] that he had consulted this ''Life is Strange Wiki'' when creating the book.
