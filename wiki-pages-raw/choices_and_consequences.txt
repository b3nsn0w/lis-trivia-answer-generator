: ''This article is about Life is Strange. For information on Before the Storm, see [[Choices and Consequences (Before the Storm)|here]]. For information on Life is Strange 2, see [[Choices and Consequences (Life is Strange 2)|here]]''.

'''Choices and Consequences''' are a main gameplay element in ''[[Life is Strange]]''. The protagonist, [[Maxine Caulfield|Max Caulfield]], is presented with different choices in the form of available action or dialogue options and optional interactions which can stop the scene and freeze time if it is a major choice. A butterfly symbol will appear at the top of the screen after the choice is made, and Max will usually make a comment regarding her decision; she will then have the option to [[Rewind|rewind]] to make a different choice, or progress further into the story and usually reach a save checkpoint location. The choices made during the episode, along with comparisons with friends and global statistics on choices made will be revealed to the player at the end of each episode. The associated consequences will often be revealed later on in the same or in subsequent episodes.
