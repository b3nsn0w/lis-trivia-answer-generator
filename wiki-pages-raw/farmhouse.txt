}}The''' Farmhouse''' is a non-explorable derelict farm residence located on old farmstead grounds owned by the [[Prescott Family|Prescott family]].<ref>Ownership of the farmland is mentioned on Page 62 of Max's journal and in an article by The Independent newspaper that Max can read on the plane to San Francisco.</ref> The roof of the farmhouse is partially broken and the door and some windows are blocked with wooden planks.

== Episode Four - "[[Episode 4: Dark Room|Dark Room]]" ==
The farmhouse can be seen in the background behind a fence with a path leading towards it.

== Trivia ==
*Given that the model is detailed, its creation from its own concept art and prominent position on a leaked journal location overview screenshot (Note that all other on the screenshot shown locations are explorable in the final game.), it likely was considered to play a bigger role in the story at some point in development. The old barn map package is called "OldFarm.upk", which could refer to both the Prescott Barn and this building.
*An interaction with the house was present in Episode 4's subtitle files: ''Act_E4_6A_OldFarm_OldHouse_Look01_Max_010="That house is way out of our coordinates, so we don’t need to check it out."'' This line appears to have been removed in the [[Limited Edition (Life is Strange)|Limited Edition]] version of the game.
*There is a path to the farmhouse, but access is blocked by a chained and padlocked metal gate.
*According to [[The Independent#Blackwell Security Uncovers Bunker and Scandal|this]] article in [[The Independent]] newspaper, the farmhouse is owned by [[Sean Prescott]], likely inherited from [[Harry Aaron Prescott]].
*There may be an inconsistency with the location of the Dark Room from it's original conception, due to the wording used in-game ("farmhouse" and "barn"), which raises the question as to whether DONTNOD had originally intended the farmhouse to be an explorable location and the location of the Dark Room.<ref group="note">Upon exploring the farmhouse building with a free camera, it certainly seems to be more complete when compared to other buildings that are used as environmental decoration in the game.</ref> Only the derelict house could be a "farmhouse"; the barn can only be a "barn" unless converted into a dwelling, which in this case, it is not. Concept art of this farmhouse was [https://imgur.com/gM26RAT uploaded] in July 2015 before the release of Episode 4. Chloe tells Max in Episode 4 that "we have to go out to that farmhouse by ourselves." However, they do not go to the farmhouse but head to the barn, which they both refer to as a "barn" when there. When Max sends a text to David in Episode 5, she tells him that the Dark Room is located "under the Prescotts’ farmhouse." An [[The Independent#Blackwell Security Uncovers Bunker and Scandal|article]] in a [[The Independent|newspaper]] on the [[plane]] in Episode 5 reads: "Even Sean Prescott, the most powerful businessman in the area, is under investigation for his role as owner of the farmhouse where the high-tech "dark room" studio was located."
