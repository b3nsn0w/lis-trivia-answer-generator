== Trivia ==
* ''The Ramones'' seem to be so important to Steve that he mentions them 4 times.
* His name might be a [[References (Life is Strange)|reference]] to former UK rugby player Stephen Thomas Hackney aka. Steve Hackney.
** Alternatively, it might be a reference to British '70's singer Steve Harley and his band Cockney Rebel, whose quirky, slightly menacing style arguably refigured punk. Hackney is a London borough, which may or may not be significant.
* The prefix 555 is widely used for fictitious telephone numbers in North American television shows, films, video games and other media in order to prevent curious callers from bothering real people and organizations by telephoning numbers they see in works of fiction.<ref name=":1" />
