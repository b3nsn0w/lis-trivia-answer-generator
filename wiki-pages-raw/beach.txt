The '''Beach''' is a location first seen in [[Episode 2: Out of Time|Episode 2]]. Previous to that, we can catch a glimpse of it by looking towards the sea at the [[lighthouse]].

== Episode Two - "[[Episode 2: Out of Time|Out of Time]]" ==
The beach is first seen in the ending cutscene of this episode, as [[Frank Bowers]] and [[Pompidou]] sit there admiring the eclipse.

== Episode Four - "[[Episode 4: Dark Room|Dark Room]]" ==
The [[Alternative Beach|alternative beach]] is featured in the [[Alternative Timeline (Life is Strange)|alternative timeline]] in the beginning of this episode.

Trying to find out more about [[Rachel Amber]]'s disappearance, [[Maxine Caulfield|Max Caulfield]] and [[Chloe Price]] drive to the beach to confront [[Frank Bowers|Frank]] and get a list of his clients. This results in a complex showdown that ends with Frank getting possibly shot or stabbed, though it is possible to befriend him.

== Episode Five - "[[Episode 5: Polarized|Polarized]]" ==
After convincing Chloe to not enter the [[End of the World Party]], Max wakes up at the beach with Chloe by her side, and finds out that the [[storm]] is approaching [[Arcadia Bay]]. They share a hug and Chloe tells Max everything that happened while she was out. Shortly after they decide to proceed to the lighthouse, Max loses consciousness and falls into a disturbing [[Max's Nightmare|nightmare]].
