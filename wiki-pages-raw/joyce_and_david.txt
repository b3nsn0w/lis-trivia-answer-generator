In ''Before the Storm'', it is established that David and Joyce started dating not that long before the game's events that are set in May 2010 (Chloe is 16 years old at this time). It is also said that David is about to move in to the Price household soon in this game. But in ''Life is Strange'', the original game ''Before the Storm'' is based on, a chronological [[timestream]] montage shows that Joyce and David were married '''before Chloe's 16th birthday'''. A picture of a married Joyce and David appears prior to an image of Chloe on her 16th birthday in this timestream montage (also see "Chloe's Blue Hair" for further information).
