[[Maxine Caulfield|Max Caulfield]]'s retro instant '''camera''' is a major gameplay and storywise element in ''[[Life is Strange]]''. Her camera can be used to take [[Optional Photos|optional photographs]] as she explores the [[:Category:Optional Photo Location|various locations]] in [[Arcadia Bay]].

== Background ==
Ever since Max was a young child, she has been drawn to old analog camera gear rather than digital tech, and her interest in photography has lasted into her late teens.

Five years before the events of ''Life is Strange'', the [[:Category:Caulfield Family|Caulfields]] left [[Arcadia Bay]] to move to [[Seattle]]. It can be assumed Max spent those years honing her photography skills before being accepted into [[Blackwell Academy]]'s scholarship program during the summer of 2013. She is happy to have been accepted into such a prestigious art school and is looking forward to [[Mark Jefferson]]'s class which she describes as being "one of the best photography programs in the country." 

Max appreciates all kinds of styles and techniques when it comes to photography, but it is the instant camera selfie that she loves most. 

== Life is Strange ==
We first see Max's camera in Jefferson's [[Photography Lab|classroom]] near the beginning of Episode 1, "[[Episode 1: Chrysalis|Chrysalis]]." During this lesson, the shock of predicting an occurrence ([[Victoria Chase]]'s phone ringing) makes her accidentally knock it off her desk, breaking it. She manages to fix it by testing her [[rewind]] power that has suddenly manifested. The camera is broken once again during a confrontation with [[Nathan Prescott]] on Blackwell Academy's [[Blackwell Parking Lot|parking lot]]. After failing to fix it at [[Chloe Price]]'s [[Madsen Household|house]], Chloe gives her a replacement instant camera as a belated birthday gift. This camera originally belonged to her father, [[William Price]].

If Max chooses to save Arcadia Bay, Max will revert to her original yellow camera which will never have been broken in the first place. Max will also receive William's old camera from Joyce as seen in the last [[Timestream|timestream montage]]. It is unknown if this is the camera she will use from this moment on.

=== Alternative Timeline ===
In the [[Alternative Timeline (Life is Strange)|alternative timeline]], William uses his camera to take a picture of Chloe and Max, the same picture she uses to go back to this moment. Max also has the chance to use his camera to take a picture of Chloe and William cooking.

== Before the Storm ==
In the prequel game, ''[[Life is Strange: Before the Storm|Before the Storm]]'', the instant camera that originally belonged to William and was later gifted to Max can be seen in the garage of the [[Price Household (Before the Storm)|Price household]]. When Chloe looks at it, she wonders if there are still films made for it.

In the bonus episode, "[[Farewell]]", Max can pick up and take a selfie with the instant camera that belongs to Chloe's father, and she can use it to take photos throughout the episode. When Max asks Chloe why her dad's camera is in her room, Chloe tells Max that her dad said she could bring it up there for Max to use because he's tired of watching her drool all over herself every time he uses it - "his words."

== Trivia ==
* [[File:Polaroid.png|thumb|220x220px]] Max's cameras seem to be Polaroid models. The model seen at the start of "Chrysalis" is likely based on the Polaroid JobPro and other models from 600 Polaroid camera line; the camera Chloe gave her is based on the Polaroid 1200si from the Polaroid Image/Spectra line of Polaroid cameras. 
* The Polaroid brand is probably never mentioned during the original game for copyright reasons.<ref group="note">Only the unspoken attribution tags for the game's localized files mention the Polaroid brand. For example: ''Act_E1_2A_ArtClass_Polaroid_Look01_Max_010="I do love my analog camera. I should take a quick picture now."''</ref>  However, the two final choices in the game are shown as photographs printed on typical Polaroid instant film where the brand name can be seen, which seems to suggest Max uses this film. Since the 11-digit Polaroid code found under the pictures (normally found only on the back of the photographs) doesn't include any letter, it confirms that it is an integral film and not a Peel-Apart Pack Film.<ref>[https://mypolaroidblog.wordpress.com/tag/dating-polaroids How to Date a Polaroid]</ref> The picture being visible on the back side of the film is an inconsistency, whether the art department intended it for aesthetic reasons or not.  
* Polaroid ceased production of its instant film in 2008 when it filed for bankruptcy protection. Its last-manufactured film stock would expire toward the end of 2009.<ref>[https://www.zdnet.com/article/its-official-polaroid-will-stop-manufacturing-instant-film-at-end-of-year/ Article on Polaroid ceasing manufacture of instant film in 2008]</ref> While it is possible that Max could be using expired film in her camera, there would be a high chance of image degradation if the chemicals developed at all, even if the film had been kept refrigerated.<ref>[https://youtu.be/IIPV83_hLqM Video on shooting with expired Polaroid film]. Bear in mind this video was made in 2010, so expired film degradation would have been continuing on from that year.</ref>
* As the original game is set in 2013, Max is perhaps more likely to use film from ''The Impossible Project'', the only company in the world that continues to manufacture original format instant film for Polaroid cameras.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/7498852/Polaroid-film-manufactured-once-again.html Article on ''The Impossible Project''.]</ref> This film is renowned to be expensive due to its exclusivity. Max even comments on this in the game: "Instant film is so damn hard to find and expensive now." In the [[Alternative Timeline (Life is Strange)]], Max's [[Vanessa Caulfield|mother]] texts her to ask her if she needs to spend so much, to which Max replies, "I only bought film, not a camera." Max's mother then suggests that "maybe it's time to go digital". It is likely that [[Don't Nod|DONTNOD]] have based the design of Max's instant film packaging on ''The Impossible Project''<nowiki/>'s packaging for their 1st-grade-formula 600 film.<ref>Release date and film type is mentioned in [https://instant.university/tag/600-film/ this article].</ref><ref group="note">In late 2017, all film produced by The Impossible Project was rebranded to ''Polaroid Originals''. The film is still manufactured in Enschede, Netherlands - the last remaining Polaroid factory.</ref>

* Whenever Max takes a photograph, she shakes the picture before placing it in her bag. It is not recommended to shake modern Polaroid film formula like the film made by ''{{Wiki|Polaroid_Originals|The Impossible Project}}''. Shaking the photograph does not develop the photograph faster and could damage the quality of the image. This doesn't apply to old film before the 70s.<ref>[https://www.thephoblographer.com/2016/05/02/phoblographer-answers-really-need-shake-polaroid/ The Phoblographer Answers: Do You Really Need to Shake a Polaroid?]</ref>
* In the [[Director's Commentary]], the moment where Max rips up one of her instant photos is discussed. It is acknowledged that it's very hard to tear apart a Polaroid due to the strong plastic, and it wouldn't normally be possible by hand. They decided to keep it in the game because of the strong symbolism in Max tearing up her [[Everyday Heroes Photo Contest|Everyday Heroes]] photo, and perhaps bad film quality made it possible.
* In the ''[[Life is Strange: Before the Storm|Before the Storm]]'' bonus episode "[[Farewell]]", Max mentions the name Polaroid: "I love how Polaroid cameras make every photo look a little nostalgic."
