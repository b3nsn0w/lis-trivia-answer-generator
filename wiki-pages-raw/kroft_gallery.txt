The '''Kroft Gallery''' is a photo gallery located in [[Eugene]], OR. [[Victoria Chase]] submits photos to the gallery but unfortunately gets rejected.

== Episode One - "[[Episode 1: Chrysalis|Chrysalis]]" ==
A letter from Amanda Kroft, the owner of the gallery, to Victoria can be seen in [[Victoria's Room|Victoria's room]]. Max remarks that she at least puts her work out there, unlike her. The letter reads as follows:

{{Bigquote|Dear Ms Chase

Gallery. Unfortunately, your work is not compatible 
with our mission statement. We appreciate your
effort and wish you success in future endeavors.

Best
