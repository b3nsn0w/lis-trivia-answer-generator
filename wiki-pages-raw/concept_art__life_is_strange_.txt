== Trivia ==
*When [[Maxine Caulfield|Max Caulfield]] attempts to fix her broken camera in [[Chloe's Room|Chloe's room]] in Episode 1, "[[Episode 1: Chrysalis|Chrysalis]]", there are a number of polaroids visible on the desk. One of these looks very similar to the box/cover art of ''Life is Strange''. It is not obvious in the game itself, as Max's broken camera slightly obscures this particular photo, but the game files reveal the full image.

* In early concept art for Max's room that was uploaded to the Feral Interactive [https://www.feralinteractive.com/en/games/lifeisstrange/ website], Max appeared to have an environmentally conscious roommate. A poster that appears in Victoria's room in the game can be seen under the bunk (a bird with paint drips), but concept art for Victoria's room also exists, so this roommate may not have been Victoria, or it could have been an early idea for her.
