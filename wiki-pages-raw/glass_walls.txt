== Lyrics ==
: Do you believe in destiny and fate?
: Do you say now or never
: Or never too late?

: The time has passed
: But I remember everything
: A flash that faded fast
: But my bruised heart still sings
: It sings

: Glass walls and waterfalls
: Can't stop your light
: From reaching my eyes
: Kingdoms can rise and fall
: I won't lose the key
: If you find the door

: And when the mist descends
: And hope is gone
: We'll freeze a dream
: To last until another dawn
: Cos when the mountains fall
: And crumble into dust
: Our bones may turn to stone
: But hearts like ours don't rust
: Don't rust

: Glass walls and waterfalls
: Can't stop your light
: From reaching my eyes
: Kingdoms can rise and fall
: I won't lose the key
: If you find the door

: Glass walls and waterfalls
: Can't stop your light
: From reaching my eyes
: Kingdoms can rise and fall
: I won't lose the key
: If you find the door
