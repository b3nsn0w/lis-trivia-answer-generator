[[Mr. Jefferson]] holds his lectures in this room including a course called "The Language of Photography".<ref>This information is from [[Media:Max-schedule.png|Max's timetable]].</ref> It is well-equipped with high-tech photography equipment and literature.

After having a disturbing dream about a [[The Storm|storm]] destroying [[Arcadia Bay]], [[Maxine Caulfield|Max Caulfield]] awakens in Jefferson's class in the middle of his lecture. The lesson finishes, leaving Max to explore the classroom if she likes. She returns to the classroom a short while later, having rewound time.

After spending the morning with [[Chloe Price|Chloe]], Max heads to the photography lab for Mr. Jefferson's class. The room is once again explorable during this time.

== Episode Three - "[[Episode 3: Chaos Theory|Chaos Theory]]" ==
During Max and Chloe's night investigation at Blackwell, Max is able to visit the photography lab, particularly to find ingredients for a pipe bomb to open the [[Principal Wells' Office|Principal's office]].

== Episode Five - "[[Episode 5: Polarized|Polarized]]" ==
After rewinding to the first day of the week, by focusing on the selfie she took during Jefferson's first class, Max finds herself again in the middle of his lecture.

The classroom is, later in the episode, featured again in [[Max's Nightmare|Max's nightmare]].

== Optional Photos ==
During Episode 1, there is an [[Optional Photos|optional photograph]] obtainable from the desk etchings on the desk opposite Max's.

During Episode 2, there is an optional photograph obtainable by standing behind Alyssa at the window, and snapping the shot.

During Episode 5, Kate Marsh may be photographed after speaking to her and reassuring her about the many friends and supporters she has.

During Episode 5, the desk etchings can once more be photographed after looking at them twice.
