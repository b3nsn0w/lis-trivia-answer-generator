Co-Writer Michel Koch said in an interview: "We wanted Sean to have a somewhat difficult relationship at the start of the game where - he wasn't bullying, but there's this tension, this fighting between brothers. But, it has to be the right balance so it doesn't feel obnoxious or the player doesn't like Sean."<ref>[https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-08-21-life-is-strange-2 Why Life is Strange 2 is ditching Arcadia Bay for its radically different roadtrip] (August 21, 2018)</ref>
