[[File:Maxnightmarejournal.png|thumb|272x272px|Max's journal in the nightmare sequence]]In [[Maxine Caulfield|Max]]'s [[Max's Nightmare|nightmare]] scenes, opening [[Max's Journal|Max's journal]] reveals violent and contorted versions of her entries with a degree of self-loathing. This also effects her pictures, texts and character notes.

== Diary Entry ==
=== Left Page ===
<blockquote>Maxine, you keep fucking up. How many times does [[Chloe Price|Chloe]] have to die in front of you? Maybe it would be better to actually, you know, have a life?</blockquote>

* THE DOE A LIE THE DOE IS A LIE THE DOE

* MAX IN THE DARK ROOM ''(repeated about 8 times)''

* FIND MY CAT PIX. PLEASE. MY HEART IS BROKEN.

* <span style="transform:scaleX(-1); display:inline-block">CHLOE CHLOE CHLOE</span> ''(CHLOE backwards)''

* ALWAYS TAKE THE SHOT

=== Right Page ===
<blockquote>TAKE A SELFIE, HO! Yes, you're running out of choices. Let's All Go To The [[Lighthouse]]! Max, why do you want to kill everybody? What did everybody ever do to you? Bully.</blockquote>

* DEATH DEATH ONLY DEATH ONLY DEATH ONLY DEATH ONLY DEATH ONLY CHLOE 

* NO NO

* GO FUCK YOUR SELFIE ''(repeated 4 times)''

* <span style="transform:scaleX(-1); display:inline-block">RACHEL RACHEL RACHEL</span> ''([[Rachel Amber|RACHEL]] backwards)''

== Pictures ==
Max's journal in the nightmare sequence displays various scribbles and pictures that are a part of her subconscious anxieties.
Notable among these are: 
* An instant camera shooting out blood (similar to the one Chloe gave her) alongside [[Mark Jefferson|Mr. Jefferson]]'s advice to "always take the shot."
* Skulls with a deer skull.
* Multiple eyes.
* Chloe's head on a butterfly with a ripped wing.
