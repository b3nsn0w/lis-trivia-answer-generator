'''Raoul Barbet''' is a director working at [[Don't Nod|DONTNOD Entertainment]] and at DONTNOD since 2011. He is one of the two Creative/Game Directors responsible for the DONTNOD-developed ''Life is Strange'' related installments, the original ''[[Life is Strange]]'' (2015), ''[[The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit]]'' (2018) and ''[[Life is Strange 2]]'' (2018). He is also supervising the music department of the developers team.

== Career ==
Raoul Barbet has a background in film and audiovisuals and worked in Canada on projects that were unrelated to the video-gaming industry.

From 2008 to 2010, he worked on Quantic Dream's ''Heavy Rain'' as Game Designer/Builder and Motion Capture Technician. This was like a dream come true for Barbet as one of his favorite video games was ''Fahrenheit'' by the same studio (released in the United States as ''Indigo Prophecy''). Barbet states: "When I played [Fahrenheit], I knew I wanted to be part of the games industry. It was quite cinematic, and talked about very important social issues. It was a real shock for me."<ref>[https://www.shacknews.com/article/117561/from-chaos-the-aspirational-storytelling-of-life-is-strange?fbclid=IwAR2wqFaIDaEJSVtLSTulw_Or8MADzeqH9qmLxuJDU0hpSwcewz8tMzSDP6c From Chaos: The Aspirational Storytelling of Life is Strange] (May 13, 2020).</ref>

Joining Dontnod Entertainment in 2011, he worked on their first game ''Remember Me'' as Game / Cinematic / Narrative Designer.

Starting from 2013, he's been working on the ''Life is Strange ''games as Writer, Co-Director and Designer.

During Game Developers Conference in March 2019, Raoul Barbet and Audio Director [[Sébastien Gaillard]] held a presentation called [[GDC Talk March 2019|"'Life is Strange': Music in a Narrative Driven Game"]], presenting a case study on the use of music in narrative driven games and its functionality on a cinematographic, narrative and design point of view. In this talk, they reveal Dontnod Entertainment's creative visions and how they approached turning them into technical solutions in their games ''Life is Strange'', ''Life is Strange 2'' and ''The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit''.

* Raoul's cute little dog signature is present on [[Maxine Caulfield|Max Caulfield]]'s pencil case that we first see in [[Episode 1: Chrysalis|Episode 1]] in [[Mark Jefferson]]'s [[Photography Lab|classroom]].
