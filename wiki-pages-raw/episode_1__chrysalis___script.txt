=== '''Nightmare''' ===
<span style="font-size:larger">'''- [[Lighthouse]] -'''</span>

''It is raining heavily. The forest and the lighthouse pathway are lit up momentarily by lightning flashes. Max is lying on the ground with her eyes closed. She slowly opens her eyes and starts to look around.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Where am I? What's happening? ''[gets up]'' I'm trapped in a storm? How did I get here? ...and where is "here"?

''Max notices the lighthouse in the distance.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Wait... There's the lighthouse... I'll be safe if I can make it there... I hope... Please let me make it there...

''Max lifts up her left arm to protect herself from the wind as she walks up the path. She reaches the lighthouse and sees [[The Storm|the tornado]] approaching [[Arcadia Bay]].''

'''Max:''' Holy shit.

''The tornado blows up a boat, which hits the lighthouse and breaks it in two. The upper portion starts to fall on Max.''

'''Max:''' Whoa! No!

=== '''Blackwell''' ===
<span style="font-size:larger">'''- [[Photography Lab|Art Class]] -'''</span>
==== '''[[Jefferson]]'s Lecture''' ====
''Max wakes up and examines her surroundings.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Whoa! That was so surreal.

'''Mr. Jefferson:''' Alfred Hitchcock famously called film, "little pieces of time" but he could be talking about photography, as he likely was.

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Okay... I'm in class...

''[[Stella]]'s pen falls on the floor and she reaches down to pick it up.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Everything's cool... I'm okay...

'''Mr. Jefferson:''' These pieces of time can frame us in our glory and our sorrow; from light to shadow; from color to chiaroscuro...

''[[Taylor]] throws a paper ball at [[Kate Marsh|Kate]].''

'''Mr. Jefferson:''' Now, can you give me an example of a photographer who perfectly captured the human condition in black and white? Anybody? Bueller?

''[[Victoria]]'s phone vibrates.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' I didn't fall asleep, and... that sure didn't feel like a dream... Weird.

'''Victoria:''' Diane Arbus.

'''Mr. Jefferson:''' There you go, Victoria! Why Arbus?

'''Victoria:''' Because of her images of hopeless faces. You feel like, totally haunted by the eyes of those sad mothers and children.

'''Mr. Jefferson:''' She saw humanity as tortured, right? And frankly, it's bullshit. Shh, keep that to yourself. Seriously though, I could frame any one of you in a dark corner, and capture you in a moment of desperation. And any one of you could do that to me. Isn't that too easy? Too obvious? What if Arbus chose to capture people at the height of their beauty or innocence? She had a brilliant eye, so she could have taken another approach.

'''Victoria:''' I have to admit, I'm not a big fan of her work. I prefer... Robert Frank.

'''Mr. Jefferson:''' Me too, Victoria. He captured the essence of post-war, beat America. And there was honesty about the economic conditions of the era, but a beauty in the struggle. You don't have beauty without a beat. Which explains why Frank was Kerouac's photographic muse and both were the great chroniclers of the 1950's. Well... We've all seen that iconic shot of Kerouac on the balcony—and if you haven't, shame, shame—capturing the romantic urban solitude of the 20th century poet. You dig? Now, contrast Frank's stark Americana, with Salvador Dali's surrealist photographs. Like Cocteau, he was a true renaissance man, and his famous self-portraits are famous early examples of that truly awful word you pesky kids love so much, the "selfie"... And it's a great tradition, and I wholeheartedly fight for your right to self-expression. Or selfie-expression. Heh, sorry, I know. So if anybody wants to question the portrait as modern narcissism, they could go back hundreds of years to blame society. Speaking of questions, I bet you thought I'd talk all the way until the bell rang. It's your turn to lecture us. Now, based on the chapters I have no doubt you all memorized, who can tell me the name of the actual process that led to the birth of the self-portrait? Anybody? ... This does not bode well. Just jump right in with an answer. This was in the chapters you read. You did read the chapters, right? Your silence is deafening. If this were a photo, I'd call it a still life.

''Max looks at her entry photo.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Look at this crap! How can I show this to Mr. Jefferson? I can hear the class laughing at me now.

''Max takes a selfie with [[Max's Camera|her camera]].''

'''Mr. Jefferson:''' Shh, I believe Max has taken what you kids call a "selfie"... A dumb word for a wonderful photographic tradition. And Max... has a gift. Of course, as you all know, the photo portrait has been popular since the early 1800's. Your generation was not the first to use images for "selfie-expression." Sorry. I couldn't resist. The point remains that the portraiture has always been a vital aspect of art, and photography, for as long as it's been around. Now, Max, since you've captured our interest and clearly want to join the conversation, can you please tell us the name of the process that gave birth to the first self-portraits?

<tabber>You're asking me?=<h5 style="display:none">You're asking me?</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' You're asking me? Let me think... Um...

</blockquote>

|-|I did know...=<h5 style="display:none">I did know...</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' I did know! ...But I kinda forgot.

</blockquote>

</tabber>

'''Mr. Jefferson:''' ''(angrily)'' You either know this or not, Max. Is there anybody here who knows their stuff?

'''Victoria:''' Louis Daguerre was a French painter who created "daguerreotypes" a process that gave portraits a sharp reflective style, like a mirror. ''[turns to Max]'' Now you're totally stuck in the Retro Zone. Sad face.

''Taylor laughs.''

'''Mr. Jefferson:''' Very good, Victoria. The Daguerreian Process brought out fine detail in people's faces, making them extremely popular from the 1800's onward. The first American daguerreotype self-portrait was done by Robert Cornelius. You can find out all about him... In your textbook. Or even... online.

''Bell rings.''

'''Mr. Jefferson:''' And guys, don't forget the deadline to submit a photo in the "[[Everyday Heroes Photo Contest|Everyday Heroes]]" contest. I'll fly out with the winner to San Francisco where you'll be feted by the art world. It's great exposure, and it can kickstart a career in photography. So, Stella and Alyssa, get it together. Taylor, don't hide. I'm still waiting for your entry, too. And yes, Max, I see you pretending not to see me.

''Victoria walks over to Mr. Jefferson.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Victoria doesn't waste a second kissing ass...

==== '''Optional Conversation with Kate''' ====
'''Max:''' Hi, Kate.

'''Kate:''' Oh, hi Max.

<tabber>I hope I didn't embarrass you...=<h5 style="display:none">I hope I didn't embarrass you...</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' Kate, I hope I didn't embarrass you with my lame answer.

'''Kate:''' It sucks to be dragged into the spotlight.

'''Max:''' Unless you're Victoria.

'''Kate:''' She's got nothing on you, Max. Well, I should get going.

'''Max:''' Yeah, me too. Talk to you later.

'''Kate:''' Sure.

'''Max:''' I hear that. Want to go grab a cup o' tea and bitch about life?

'''Kate:''' Sure.

'''<u>Jefferson and Victoria's conversation</u>'''

'''Mr. Jefferson:''' Yes, Victoria, you still have to do your homework this week, even if you're submitting your photo for the competition. Everybody in class is turning a photo, so you see the dilemma.

'''Victoria:''' I know, Mr. Jefferson. I just worked so hard on this shot, and I'm sure you know what it's like to be consumed by your work. I just really think "Everyday Heroes" is an important cultural event and I want to represent Blackwell Academy.

'''Mr. Jefferson:''' You have just by participating, by putting yourself out there in the world. Well, no matter who wins, this is just a bump on a bigger road. I don't want anybody to feel excluded from this process. But I also want everybody to know that this photographic world is not for everybody. I had my moment in the camera eye and everybody should have that chance, right?

'''Victoria:''' Oh, totally. I only want to share whatever gifts I have with the world...

==== '''Conversation with Jefferson''' ====

<tabber>(Max initiates the conversation)=<h5 style="display:none">(Max initiates the conversation)</h5><blockquote>

''Max approaches Victoria and Jefferson.''

'''Max:''' Excuse me, Mr. Jefferson, can I talk to you for a moment?

'''Victoria:''' Yes, excuse you.

'''Mr. Jefferson:''' No, Victoria, excuse us.

</blockquote>

|-|(Max tries to leave)=<h5 style="display:none">(Max tries to leave)</h5><blockquote>

'''Mr. Jefferson:''' I see you, Max Caulfield. Don't even think about leaving here until we talk about your entry.

''Max turns around and approaches Victoria and Jefferson.''

</blockquote>

</tabber>

'''Mr. Jefferson:''' I'd never let one of photography's future stars avoid handing in her picture.

<tabber>Do I have to?=<h5 style="display:none">Do I have to?</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' Do I have to? I just don't think it's that big a deal.

</blockquote>

|-|I didn't have any time...=<h5 style="display:none">I didn't have any time...</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' I didn't have any time... Way too much homework.

</blockquote>

</tabber>

'''Mr. Jefferson:''' Max, you're a better photographer than a liar... Now I know it's a drag to hear some old dude lecture you... but life won't wait for you to play catch-up. You're young, the world is yours, blah blah blah, right? But you do have a gift, you have the fever to take images, to frame the world only the way you envision it. Now, all you need is the courage to share your gift with others. That's what separates the artist, from the amateur.

''Max leaves the art class.''

<span style="font-size:larger">'''Corridor'''</span>

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Welcome to the real world...

''[[Juliet Watson|Juliet]] and [[Zachary Riggins|Zachary]] start walking across the [[Blackwell Academy Hallway|hallway]].''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' I need a serious timeout in the bathroom. Splash water on my face and make sure I don't look like a total loser.

'''<u>Juliet and Zachary's conversation in the background</u>'''

'''Juliet:''' You didn't tell me how cute I looked yet.

'''Zachary:''' I was about to. You always look cute.

'''Juliet:''' Just cute?

'''Zachary:''' Hot.

'''Juliet:''' Then I might send you a special picture during class.

'''<u>[[Courtney Wagner|Courtney]] and Taylor's conversation</u>'''

'''Courtney:''' Why would anybody want to carry around a dorky instamatic?

'''Taylor:''' Because Max wants everybody to see how hip she is.

'''Courtney:''' As if. She plays it so shy.

'''Taylor:''' She's so fucking shy she takes selfies with a giant camera.

''Max puts on her headphones and the music starts playing. Max walks along the corridor and then enters the bathroom.''

<span style="font-size:larger">'''Bathroom'''</span>

'''Max:''' ''(taking off earphones, thinking)'' Empty. Good. Nobody can see my meltdown. Except for me.

''Max washes her face using one of the sinks, then takes out her polaroid photo.''

'''Max:''' ''(looking at her photo, thinking)'' Just relax. Stop torturing yourself. You have "a gift".

'''Max:''' Fuck it.

''Max tears apart her photo and drops it on the floor.''

''A blue butterfly flies in and lands on a bucket, behind a stall. Max follows after.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' When a door closes, a window opens... Or, something like that. Okay girl, you don't get a photo op like this everyday...

''Max approaches the butterfly and takes a photo of it. The butterfly takes off and lands on a sink. [[Nathan Prescott|Nathan]] enters the bathroom, closing the door behind him. Max hears the sound and turns around.''

==== '''Nathan and Chloe's conversation''' ====
'''Nathan:''' ''(breathing heavily)'' It's cool, Nathan... Don't stress... You're okay, bro. Just count to three... Don't be scared... You own this school... If I wanted, I could blow it up... You're the boss...

''[[Chloe Price|Chloe]] enters.''

'''Nathan:''' So what do you want?

'''Chloe:''' I hope you checked the perimeter, as my step-ass would say. Now, let's talk bidness—

'''Nathan:''' I got nothing for you.

'''Chloe:''' Wrong. You got hella cash.

'''Nathan: '''That's my family, not me.

'''Chloe:''' Oh, boohoo, poor little rich kid. I know you been pumpin' drugs 'n' shit to kids around here... I bet your respectable family would help me out if I went to them. Man, I can see the headlines now—

'''Nathan:''' Leave them out of this, bitch.

'''Chloe:''' I can tell everybody Nathan Prescott is a punk ass who begs like a little girl and talks to himself—

''Nathan takes out his gun and points it at Chloe. She backs up into the wall and Nathan stands in front of her, one arm against the wall and the other pointing the gun at her stomach.''

'''Nathan:''' You don't know who the fuck I am or who you're messing around with!

'''Chloe:''' Where'd you get that? What are you doing? Come on, put that thing down!

'''Nathan:''' Don't EVER tell me what to do. I'm so SICK of people trying to control me!

'''Chloe:''' You are going to get in hella more trouble for this than drugs—

'''Nathan: '''Nobody would ever even miss your "punk ass" would they?

'''Chloe:''' Get that gun away from me, psycho!

''Chloe pushes Nathan away from her and he pulls the trigger, shooting Chloe in the stomach. Max comes out from behind the stall.''

'''Max:''' NO!

''Max stretches out her right hand. The gun and Chloe fall on the ground in slow motion and everything becomes blurry. Moments later, the whole sequence is reversed and Max finds herself in the art class again.''

==== '''Jefferson's Lecture''' ====

'''Max:''' ''(looking around nervously, thinking)'' Whoa! What the fuck...? How—how can that be?
I was in the bathroom... He shot that poor girl... I held up my hand...and then I was back here.

'''Mr. Jefferson:''' Alfred Hitchcock famously called film "little pieces of time" but he could be talking about photography, as he likely was.

''Stella's pen falls on the floor and she reaches down to pick it up.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' I already heard this lecture...

'''Mr. Jefferson:''' These pieces of time can frame us in our glory and our sorrow; from light to shadow; from color to chiaroscuro...

''Taylor throws a paper ball at Kate.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Now Kate is being hassled again... And if Victoria's phone rings... This is real.

''Victoria's phone vibrates. Max knocks her camera off the desk and breaks it.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Shit! Man, I cannot believe this... Okay, if I'm crazy, I might as well go all the way... Can I actually reverse time?

'''Mr. Jefferson:''' Now can you give me an example of a photographer who perfectly captured the human condition in black and white? Anybody? Bueller?

'''Victoria:''' Diane Arbus.

'''Mr. Jefferson:''' There you go, Victoria! Why Arbus?

'''Victoria:''' Because of her images of hopeless faces. You feel like, totally haunted by the eyes of those sad mothers and children.

''Max rewinds time with her right hand. The camera gets repaired and returns to its original place.''

'''Max:''' ''(looking at her hand, thinking)'' I did it... I actually did it! I'm a human time machine...

'''Mr. Jefferson:''' Now can you give me an example of a photographer who perfectly captured the human condition in black and white? Anybody? Bueller?

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Max, don't freak out. Not yet.

'''Victoria:''' Diane Arbus.

'''Mr. Jefferson:''' There you go, Victoria! Why Arbus?

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Keep it together, Max.

'''Victoria:''' Because of her images of hopeless faces. You feel like, totally haunted by the eyes of those sad mothers and children.

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' When I took my selfie, Jefferson asked me a question. If he does again, I'll know this is for real.

'''Mr. Jefferson:''' She saw humanity as tortured, right? And frankly, it's bullshit. Shh, keep that to yourself. Seriously though, I could frame any one of you in a dark corner, and capture you in a moment of desperation. And any one of you could do that to me. Isn't that too easy? Too obvious? What if Arbus chose to capture people at the height of their beauty or innocence? She had a brilliant eye, so she could have taken another approach.

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' I know I'm not dreaming this. It's real. I can tell.

'''Mr. Jefferson:''' Of course, as you all know, the photo portrait has been popular since the early 1800's. Your generation is not the first to use images for selfie-expression. Sorry.

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' So I can go back in time... What if that girl isn't dead yet? Can I save her?

'''Mr. Jefferson:''' The point remains that portraiture has always been a vital aspect of art, and photography, for as long as it's been around.

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' I need to go to the bathroom quickly and check it out!

'''Mr. Jefferson:''' Now Max, since you've captured our interest and clearly want to join the conversation, can you please tell us the name of the process that gave birth to the first self-portraits?

</tabber>

'''Mr. Jefferson:''' Nice try, Max. But you're not gonna get away that easy. We can talk more after class.

'''Max:''' ''(shaking her head, thinking)'' Oh, shit, Jefferson wants to keep me after class. And I need time to save that girl...

'''Mr. Jefferson:''' Is there anybody here who knows their stuff?

'''Victoria:''' Louis Daguerre was a French painter who created "daguerreotypes" a process that gave portraits a sharp reflective style, like a mirror. Now you're totally stuck in the Retro Zone. Sad face.

'''Mr. Jefferson:''' Very good, Victoria. The Daguerreian Process brought out fine detail in people's faces, making them extremely popular from the 1800's onward.

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' What if I rewind again, and give him the right answer?

''Max rewinds.''

'''Mr. Jefferson:''' Now Max, since you've captured our interest and clearly want to join the conversation, can you please tell us the name of the process that gave birth to the first self-portraits?

'''Max:''' The Daguerreian Process. Invented by a French painter named...Louis Daguerre. Around 1830.

'''Mr. Jefferson:''' Somebody has been reading, as well as posing. Nice work, Max.

''Victoria gives Max an annoyed look.''

'''Mr. Jefferson:''' The Daguerreian Process made portraiture hugely popular, mainly because it gave the subjects clear defined features. You can learn more when you actually finish reading the assigned chapters. Max is so far, way ahead of everybody.

''Bell rings.''

'''Mr. Jefferson:''' And, guys, don't forget the deadline to submit a photo in the "Everyday Heroes" Contest. I will fly out with the winner to San Francisco where you'll be feted by the art world. It's great exposure and it can kickstart a career in photography. So Stella and Alyssa, get it together. Taylor don't hide, I'm still waiting for your entry too. And yes Max, I see you pretending not to see me.

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Max, you are not crazy. You are not dreaming. It's time to be an everyday hero.

===='''Optional Conversation with Kate '''====
'''Kate:''' Nice answer, Max. Are you okay? You look pale.

'''Max:''' Kate, uh, did we talk at all today?

'''Kate:''' This is the first time. What's wrong?

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Okay, Max, retrace every step... ''[approaches the sink]'' I washed my face... ''[washes face]'' I shredded my photo... ''[tears up photo]'' Then the...butterfly flew in... And I took a photo...

''Max takes a photo of the butterfly. Nathan and Chloe enter the bathroom.''

'''Nathan:''' Leave them out of this, bitch.

'''Chloe:''' I can tell everybody Nathan Prescott is a punk ass who begs like a little girl and talks to himself—

''Nathan pulls out his gun.''

'''Nathan:''' You don't know who the fuck I am or who you're messing around with!

'''Chloe:''' Where'd you get that? What are you doing? Come on, put that thing down!

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Wowser, it's happening again.

'''Nathan:''' Don't EVER tell me what to do. I'm so SICK of people trying to control me!

'''Chloe:''' You are going to get in hella more trouble for this than drugs—

'''Nathan:''' Nobody would ever even miss your "punk ass", would they?

'''Chloe:''' Get that gun away from me, psycho!

''Nathan kills Chloe and drops his gun on the ground. He then starts to shake Chloe and walk around the bathroom nervously.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Holy shit, I can't let this happen... If I can reverse time again, I can help her.

'''Nathan:''' Oh... Shit! No, no, no, no...

''Max rewinds.''

''Max looks at the fire alarm.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' I need a hammer to break it open!

'''Nathan:''' Don't EVER tell me what to do. I'm so SICK of people trying to control me!

'''Chloe:''' You are going to get in hella more trouble for this than drugs—

'''Nathan:''' Nobody would ever even miss your "punk ass", would they?

''Max moves a maintenance cart, grabs a hammer from the floor and breaks the fire alarm glass with it. She then starts the fire alarm. Nathan stops pointing his gun at Chloe and looks behind him.''

'''Nathan:''' No way...

''Chloe knees Nathan in the stomach or groin and pushes him to the floor.''

'''Chloe:''' Don't EVER touch me again, freak!

''Chloe exits the bathroom. Nathan picks up his gun and notices the pieces of Max's photo on the floor.''

'''Nathan:''' Another shitty day...

''Nathan exits the bathroom.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' That did not happen! This cannot be real! I just saw a girl get shot and then saved her! What the fuck is going on? Do. Not. Freak. Out.

''Max exits the bathroom.''

==== '''Conversation with [[David]]''' ====

'''David:''' Hey, do you hear that fire alarm? That means you should be outside.

'''Max:''' I had to use the bathroom...

'''David:''' Girls always use that excuse.

'''Max:''' Excuse for what?

'''David:''' For whatever you're up to. Your face is covered in guilt.

'''Max:''' The alarm tripped me out.

'''David: '''Then trip on out of here, missy. Or are you hiding something? Huh?

'''[[Raymond Wells|Principal Wells]]:''' Thank you Mr. Madsen, the situation is under control. There's no emergency here. Leave Miss Caulfield alone and please turn off that alarm, since that's your job.

'''Max:''' I just saw Nathan Prescott waving a gun around...in the girls' room.

'''Principal Wells:''' Nathan Prescott. You sure?

'''Max:''' Yes. He was in the bathroom talking to himself with a gun. I saw everything! He was babbling like crazy—

'''Principal Wells:''' Okay, slow down, slow down. So now you saw this... Without him seeing you?

'''Max:''' I was hiding behind a stall. I have the right to be there. It's the girls' room—

'''Principal Wells:''' I know, I know. I just want to be completely clear what happened. Mr. Prescott happens to be from the town's most distinguished family. And one of Blackwell's most honored students. So it's hard for me to see him brandishing a weapon in the girls' bathroom. So what happened next?

'''Max:''' Then...then he left. I ran out here wondering what to do. Are you going to bust him?

'''Principal Wells:''' This is a serious charge. I'll look into the matter personally. Thank you for bringing it to my attention.

'''Max:''' That's it? After what I told you—

'''Principal Wells:''' We'll continue this discussion, later, in my office. Please go outside with the rest of your class now, Miss Caulfield.

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Of course this academic drone won't do anything since the Prescott family owns Blackwell now. Should I rewind and change my story?

'''Max:''' It's the truth. I felt dizzy in Mr. Jefferson's class—

'''Principal Wells:''' Just tell me what you're hiding. You can trust me.

'''Max:''' There's nothing to hide. I got sick. It happens, you know—

'''Principal Wells:''' There's that teen 'tude again. You know, I've heard enough. Don't think I don't know what goes on around here. You've only been here for three weeks and you're already causing conflict. I don't think your parents will approve when they find out. Now get outside with the class. Please.

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' No, he does not buy that at all. I may have just flushed my scholarship down the toilet... Yes, I could rewind and actually tell him the truth...

''Max follows the ghost doe to the top of the hill as a boulder falls down the left fork in the road. Thunder crashes and lightning strikes a tree, causing it to fall down in front of Max. She rewinds and walks up the path as the tree falls behind her. Max continues to follow the ghost doe up the steps to the lighthouse.''

It slowly tips over and falls into the ocean, taking chunks of the cliff with it so Max cannot cross. Max rewinds and crosses to the bench area after the debris rains down. The lighthouse roof falls over again behind her. Max then reads the newspaper stuck on the railing.''

'''Max:''' October 11th? Is this Friday? That's only four days away!

''The wind tears the newspaper out of Max's hands. Max watches the tornado.''

'''Max:''' Oh, no...

'''Chloe:''' But high, right?

'''Max:''' Listen to me, how do you think I saved you in the bathroom?

'''Chloe:''' By reversing time? Yeah, sure.

'''Max:''' I saw you get shot, Chloe. Saw you actually...die. I was able to go back and hit the fire alarm...

'''Max:''' I don't know what I have, but I have it. And I'm scared shitless.

'''Chloe:''' You need to get high. It's been a hella insane fucking day...

''Max begins shaking her head. A snowflake falls on her face and she wipes it away. Max and Chloe watch as snow begins falling all around them.''

''Warren is in the science lab working on his computer. He notices the snow and stops to watch it fall outside the window.''

''[[Pompidou]] stands next to the RV and barks. [[Frank Bowers|Frank]] opens the RV door, holding a bong in his hand, and silences him. Pompidou shakes and then scratches his head with his back foot as Frank watches the snow.''

''Victoria rips Rachel's missing poster off a display board on the main campus. She looks at it and then tosses it to the ground. She looks up at stares at the snow.''

''Principal Wells stands at the window of his office and watches the snow. He takes a sip from the glass of whiskey in his hand.''

''Jefferson sits at his desk in the photography classroom working on his computer and writing something. He glances out the window and notices the snow.''

''Nathan sits at a bench on the Main Campus. He holds a camera in his hands and appears to be ignoring the snowfall.''

''A row of red binders is shown, and each of them has a female name written on them. The last binder in the row reads "RACHEL."''
