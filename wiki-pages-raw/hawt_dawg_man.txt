It's also featured on a [https://store.na.square-enix-games.com/en_US/product/462509/life-is-strange-hawt-dawg-man-mug-rewardpromotional Square Enix mug].
*The ''Life is Strange Rewind and Play'' compact cassette, that was advertised on the [http://eu.square-enix.com/en/blog?p=411 Square Enix blog] on April Fool's in 2016, features a bonus, dubbed "the never before heard Hawt Dawg Man theme song".<ref>[http://eu.square-enix.com/en/blog/rewind-and-play-pre-order-life-strange-soundtrack Rewind and Play - Square Enix blog post] (April 1, 2016)</ref>
