== Lyrics ==
: If anything like the self destructed
: If ever alike inside you're scraping, the pockets avail
: Whatever you're like when you came in
: Whatever you use, whatever you chose,
: Whatever your acronym

: They say that either you're out or you're in
: But you're on
: They say that either you're out or you swim
: When you're on

: You start a local sound,
: A speech on how you moved around
: You tell them all so well, I had to memorize
: You poured a few tears - there's ground and there's your feet
: And never they shall meet

: If anything like the self destructed
: If ever alike inside you're scraping, the pockets avail
: Whatever you're like when you came in
: Whatever you use, whatever you chose,
: Whatever your acronym

: If anything like the self destructed
: If ever alike inside you're scraping, the pockets avail
: Whatever you're like when you came in
: Whatever you use, whatever you chose,
: Whatever your acronym

: They say that either you're out or you're in
: But you're on!
: They say that either you're out or you swim
: But you're on!

: What if we started what became
: Don't get found out again
: What if we're starting what remains
: You set our lives again

: They say that either you're out or you're in
: But you're on!
: They say that either you're out or you swim
: But you're on!

: Don't get found out again!
