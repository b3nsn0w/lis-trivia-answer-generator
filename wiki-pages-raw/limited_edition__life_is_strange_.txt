=== Episode One - "[[Episode 1: Chrysalis|Chrysalis]]" ===

:"''I feel bad for the twee hipster who lost this beret. Bet he's cute.''"
:— Max

*[[Mark Jefferson]]'s birth date on the "Support Mr. Jefferson!" page, which can be seen, when Max blames him for Kate's actions, changed from April 11, 1967, to April 11, 1975, which makes him 8 years younger.
*The [[Everyday Heroes Photo Contest]] submissions of [[Victoria Chase]] and [[Daniel DaCosta]] were swapped.

:"''Oh, shit, that's Nathan's jacket... has he been here recently?''"[[File:No_jacket.jpg|thumb|In the Limited Edition there is no jacket to be found.]]
:— Max

== Art Book ==

=== <u>Cover</u> ===
[[File:Limited Edition - Cover.png|thumb|276x276px]]
The cover of the art book is a replica of [[Max's Journal|Max's journal]]. It has 32 pages and is 5.25 inches (13.34 centimeters) wide by 6.75 inches (17.14 centimeters) tall. It is matte black with red white and blue printing resembling tape on the top of the front cover which does not extend to the spine, back, or the inside. The cover of the book has "stickers" on it as well as tape and postal stamps which gives it a kitschy aesthetic. The red white and blue "tape" is also visible on the right side of the first page along with a sticky note with unintelligible text and some doodles. This page has three stamps; one of a barn owl, one of a sailboat, and one of a monarch butterfly. The monarch butterfly may be an allusion to the Butterfly Effect ever-present in the game, the owl may be an allusion to the one that crosses Max and Chloe's path in [[Episode 4: Dark Room|episode four]], and the sailboat may be an allusion to the boat that destroys the [[lighthouse]] in Max's visions. All the concept art of locations, photos, and paintings are taped to the pages to resemble photographs.

=== <u>Contents</u> ===
The pages are printed on thick semi-gloss paper.
# The box art of the game, but instead of saying "Limited Edition" it says "PICTURE BOOK".

There is a sticker over the picture of the Two Whales that says "BROOT FEST".

# A portrait of Max's profile, a painting of her visions, and in the background there is a doodle of the [[lighthouse]]. Above the picture of the lighthouse there is a sticker of a rainbow that is pink, yellow, and blue, which resembles the pansexual flag. This may be a reference or hint to Max's sexuality and/or romantic orientation, or of those of other characters in the game.
# A painting of Max looking out off of a cliff to the water spout or tornado approaching Arcadia Bay. In the background the same image is doodled from another perspective. Above these there is a sticker saying "hello" in cursive and another below it with the words "enjoy the journey."
# Concept art of two beached whales, Arcadia Bay's coast, the lighthouse, and the scene in Episode 2 where Max sees the translucent deer in the junkyard and attempts to photograph it.

This may take place during the time when the tornado strikes Arcadia Bay. There are pictures of two parking lots and the truck parked in front of the Two Whales in Episode 2. In the background there are doodles of other cars, and in front of all there is a sticker that says "MIGHT BITE" with the word might crossed out and "WILL" written underneath in red ink.
# A photo of Max and Chloe in a dark setting with Max using the flashlight of her phone. This may be the scene in the junkyard after Chloe and Max find out about Rachel. In the background there is a buck with a monocle and a mustache. Next to it is a crumpled paper saying "OH DEER."
# A painting or concept art of the scene where Max has to save Chloe from being stuck to a railroad track with an oncoming train, and art of Max by herself discovering the dark room. The background features a doodle of Arcadia Bay storefronts. At the very front there is a sticker of a deer laying down.

In the background there is a doodle of purple paint being sloshed from a bucket, binders and art supplies, and a set of craft knives with one knife missing. The one knife missing could be a reference to Chloe taking David's gun.
# A collection of stickers including a sticker saying "WARNING: SUBJECT TO SPONTANEOUS OUTBURSTS OF NERD TALK", "It's not the DESTINATION IT'S THE journey", "AIR MAIL", "STARRY NIGHTS, LIFETIME MEMORIES", "now & there", "Do otters get songs stuck in their head?" and a blue fish in a circle. The background has doodles of pill containers, bleeding birds, a sponge with a bowtie, a cassette tape with its tape ripped out saying "RADIO KILLED ITSELF. *video is innocent!", flowers including roses and peonies, a skull with a raccoon sitting on it, and a quote saying "Love is how you stay alive even after you are gone."

The background has drawings of a circle of trees, Kate Marsh, a lock and key, three goldfish swimming, Chloe's truck speeding away, and the words "TRUE LOVE WAITS". The words "Threemetersabove the sky" are torn at the edges and appear to be glued on.
# A sticker collection including the graffiti seen on the side of the shed next to the lighthouse of Bigfoot and directly under this says "ARCADIA BIGFOOTS", two cameras, a sugar skull with dark brown hair ad a flower, a sticker saying "Peek A boo", a shooting star with the text "MAKE A WISH" in its trail, and drawings of a squirrel with a soda can, Kate Marsh with angelic wings, a ninja, and an otter and a shark facing off with the words "FIGHT" behind them.
# The last page, the art credits page, credits concept artists Eduard Caplain, [[Gary Jamroz-Palma]], Frédéric Augis, [[Alyzian|Alysianne Buy]], [[Florent Auguy]], and art director [[Michel Koch]]. The credits are on a notebook-style paper that has scribbles in each corner and behind this is a picture of [[Maxine Caulfield|Max]] hugging [[Chloe Price|Chloe]] from behind.

[[File:Pirate Disk.png|thumb|178x178px]]
* The cover art for the Soundtrack CD is based on the cover of a mix tape Max made for Chloe when she was 12.

It is referenced again in [[Life is Strange: Before the Storm|''Life is Strange: Before the Storm'']] and can be found in [[Chloe's Room (Before the Storm)|Chloe's bedroom]].
* There is an extremely rare Vinyl version.<ref>[http://na.square-enix.com/us/blog/life-strange-vinyl-soundtrack-sweepstakes Life Is Strange Vinyl Soundtrack Sweepstakes]</ref> Only a few of these vinyls were created as promotional materials for ''Life is Strange'', though (like the licensed soundtrack) they aren't sold commercially.
