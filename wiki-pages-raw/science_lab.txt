}}The '''Science Lab''', also known as the '''Science Classroom''', is one of the four main labs at [[Blackwell Academy]]. It is equipped with chemicals and biology equipment.
[[Michelle Grant]] teaches science to Blackwell's students in this lab.

== Episode Two - "[[Episode 2: Out of Time|Out of Time]]" ==
During Episode 2, [[Maxine Caulfield|Max]] can explore the science lab, where Max gets the opportunity to help out [[Warren Graham|Warren]] with his science experiment. Max can either fail or succeed in helping him by asking [[Michelle Grant|Mrs. Grant]], which will lead to an [[Optional Photos|optional photo]] opportunity.

Max can also talk with [[Brooke]], who comments that Warren is ignoring the real genius.

== Episode Three - "[[Episode 3: Chaos Theory|Chaos Theory]]" ==
During Max and [[Chloe Price|Chloe]]'s night investigation at Blackwell, Max is able to visit the science lab, particularly to find ingredients for a pipe bomb to open the [[Principal Wells' Office|Principal's office]]. Max may also take two different optional photos inside the science lab and possibly change Warren's grade for his science practical.

=== Episode Two - "Out of Time" ===
*{{Interaction|Max can look at and speak to Ms. Grant.|"Ms. Grant is so cool and smart. She defines the word 'teacher'."}}
*{{Interaction|She can look at the periodic table.|"A periodic table... Wish I knew what 'periodic' means..."}}
*{{Interaction|She can look at a "Front to the Future" poster.|"I wish I could bring a mini Warren with me to my Science exams."}}
*{{Interaction|She can look at a "Art is Science" poster.|"DaVinci was a boss."}}
*{{Interaction|She can look at and touch the aquarium.|'''Look: '''"I bet if I touch the glass all these creepy sea critters will pop up."<br>'''Touch: '''"Or nothing will happen at all."}}
*{{Interaction|She can look at and speak to Warren.|'''Before talk: '''"There's Mister Wizard hard at work."<br>'''Sodium/Potassium: '''"That's a minor fail."<br>'''Lots of potassium: '''"I don't want to laugh, but he looks so hilarious..."<br>'''Chlorine: '''"Eureka! He did it!"}}
*{{Interaction|She can take an optional photo of Warren after successfully helping him with his experiment.|"That was fun helping Warren. He's pretty cute when he's in full-on geek mode..."}}
*{{Interaction|She can look at the chemistry stuff in front of Warren.|"Bring me the brain, Igor!"}}
*{{Interaction|She can look at and speak to Brooke.|"Brooke always kinda pretends like I'm almost... not there. Why?"}}
*{{Interaction|She can look at a skeleton.|"Wonder why they don't use real skeletons..."}}

*{{Interaction|Max can look at and change the grade on Warren's exam file.|'''Helped: '''"An 'A-'? All right, all right, so Dr. Max did help Warren this morning!"<br>'''Didn't help: '''"Only a 'B-'? Warren has shattered my faith. Of course, I'm barely passing science."<br>'''Change grade: '''"You deserve way more than this for taking on Nathan, but every little grade counts..."<br>'''Look afterwards: '''"Yes, I like this 'plus' better then that 'minus.' Thanks for being there for me,<br>Warren..."}}

*{{Interaction|She can look at a chemistry book.|"So sodium chlorate is... a weed killer? You'd think Warren would have told me that factoid."}}
*{{Interaction|She can look at the chemistry stuff inside a cupboard.|"You're an artist, dammit, not a scientist. But this is so not sodium chlorate."}}
*{{Interaction|She can look at and take the sodium chlorate from the top of the cupboard '''(required)'''.|'''Look: '''"Here's the sodium chlorate box."<br>'''Take: '''"You know you're clumsy Max, don't waste your rewind power. Use the damn chair!"}}
