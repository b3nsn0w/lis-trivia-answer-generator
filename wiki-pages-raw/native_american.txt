{{Stub}}[[File:LiS1-Tobanga-2.png|thumb|300px|Tobanga Totem, which founded by Native Americans.]]'''Native American''' tribes had originally inhabited and founded [[Arcadia Bay]], and their role in the events of ''[[Life is Strange]]'' is hinted at several times throughout the game. The [[Tobanga Totem]], currently standing on the [[Prescott Dormitory]] grounds, is likely a relic left by one of the Native American communities.

According to [[Ms. Grant]], "[[Blackwell Academy]] has a noble heritage, from the Native Americans who founded this land, to the pioneers who shared it in peace, not fear and violence." She goes on to tell [[Maxine Caulfield|Max Caulfield]] that the tribes who were there first had welcomed the settlers and that both cultures "found a mutual symbiosis and thrived." Ms. Grant knows some fascinating facts about Blackwell and claims there's a lot of power in the region which she thinks "helps the creative juices flow."
