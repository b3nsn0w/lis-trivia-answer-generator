== Trivia ==
=== Life is Strange ===
* A photo at the wall in Max's room shows Max with her friends Kristen and Fernando at the {{Wiki|Fremont Troll}}, a public sculpture in the Fremont neighborhood in Seattle.
* While in Seattle, Max and [[Ryan Caulfield|her father]] used to attend matches of the local ice hockey team, the {{Wiki|Seattle Thunderbirds}}.
* On a photograph with her father, Max is seen wearing a "Seattle" sweatshirt.
* [[Victoria Chase]] was born and raised in Seattle. Her family owns a famous gallery called the "Chase Space" there.
* Max's journal contains a flyer (in two pieces) for a "Bodies and Splatters" photography exhibition at the Dusk & Dawn Gallery in Seattle.<ref>There is missing textual information from this flyer that makes it difficult for the gallery and exhibition name to be established. Journal artist Alyzian confirmed the missing information.</ref>
=== Life is Strange 2 ===
* In an interview with Eurogamer, [[Michel Koch]] revealed that they chose to have planes flying over the Diazes' neighborhood because houses near airports tend to be less expensive due to the noise pollution<ref>"The houses which are under the flight path are not selling as much as the others," he says. Sran estimates that these houses often cost £10,000-£20,000 less than others in the surrounding area without the same problem."<br/>[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33346507 BBC News - What's it like to live near an airport?] (2 July 2015)</ref>, reflecting the Diaz family's middle-class status.<ref>"What's interesting in this part is, the neighborhood they're living in - basically, I think it was three or four years ago, when I was on a trip to the United States, I went to Seattle and visited a lot of the neighborhoods next to Seattle, and in one of the neighborhoods quite next to the airport, I noticed that you have those planes every few minutes or so, so that's the kind of detail we used, knowing those houses are not that expensive, so it works for the kind of family in middle-class Sean and Esteban are living in."<br/>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84_2uTSgjkA How Dontnod Made Life is Strange 2 - Let's Play Life is Strange 2 With Michel Koch] (10:21) (17 April 2019)</ref>
