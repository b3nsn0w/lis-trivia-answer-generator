=== Life is Strange ===
"But what I did put in ''Life is Strange'' that made me feel missed is the very first thing that Jefferson says in the game which is 'I could put any of you in a dark corner and frame you' and we had a lot of talk about that, because they were like 'Are you sure that's...?' and I'm like 'I think we're gonna get away with this if we just put it in the background, cause...' and later on people were like 'oh.. eerggh he tells you from the begi...' Spoiler art!"<ref>[[PAX West 2018 Panel (August 31, 2018)]]</ref>

== Personal Life ==
Representation and talking about diversity in different kind of ways is very important to Christian Divine in his work on the ''Life is Strange'' franchise, and as a writer and creator in general.

"And you know, in terms of diversity, you know, I'm disabled, so I look at, it's very important to me that we have representation. And I can count on my one hand really how many disabled or handicapped characters in the media there are and how many disabled writers or entertainers. There's very few. And so one of the things about writing for Chloe's scene [stay?] in the wheelchair - I do not know what it's like to be in a wheelchair. I would never assume that I can tell somebody what it's like, but I have friends in wheelchairs, and I understand the obstacles and the challenges and I know how dynamic they are. And so it's - it's a matter of putting yourself -- as a disabled person, you're often on the fringe of society, so that's what you bring as a writer, if you can, to the characters."<ref>[[PAX West 2018 Panel (August 31, 2018)]]</ref>

"I know what it's like to be marginalized. I have spent my whole life that way. I'm disabled—I was born with one hand, so… I never say that I know what it's like to be a person of color or a Latino person or anything like that. Part of what you're doing when you're a writer is you're putting yourself in another person's shoes. Anybody who's reading this, if you're interested in being a writer, your first order of business is to be interested in other people. You really have to step outside yourself. It's not about you."<ref>[https://pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/01/empathy-is-the-defining-core-of-life-is-strange-an.html Empathy is the Defining Core of Life is Strange: An Interview with Christian Divine] (January 17, 2019)</ref>

"Well, disabled people are the biggest minority on the planet. It transcends race and gender and culture and as a writer for video games, I have always wanted to represent not only disabled, but all people that don't have a voice and lack diversity in games. <ref>[https://spectrumnews1.com/ca/la-west/news/2019/08/24/writer-with-bionic-hand-creates-video-games-to-represent-all-people Writer With Bionic Hand Creates Video Games to Represent All People] (August 23)</ref>
