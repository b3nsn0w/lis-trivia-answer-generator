=== '''Girls' Dormitories''' ===

==== '''Max's Room''' ====
''It is nighttime at Blackwell Academy. Max is in her room; she has fallen asleep at her desk. Max gets a text notification on her phone, and the sound wakes her.''

'''Max:''' Kate!

''Max leans over and unlocks her phone. She has received a text from Chloe.''

'''Chloe (SMS):''' I have something to show you

'''Chloe (SMS):''' meet me in front of campus

'''Chloe (SMS):''' get dat ass in gear NOW

'''Max:''' I knew Chloe would be all over this... So I better get moving.

''Max puts her phone in her pocket and gets up from her desk.''

'''<u>Optional Conversation with Alice the Rabbit</u>'''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Are you a hungry bunny? Here, nosh on this...

''Max puts a small carrot in Alice's cage.''

''Max leaves her room to enter the hallway of the girls' dormitories.''

==== '''Hallway''' ====
''Max steps out of her room and closes the door behind her. All the lights in the hallway have been turned off.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Okay, this is scary dark. Let there be...

''Max turns on the flashlight on her phone.''

==== '''Showers''' ====
''Max enters the showers and puts her phone back in her pocket because the lights are on in the bathroom. Taylor stands next to a sink brushing her teeth.''

'''<u>Optional Conversation with Taylor</u>'''

''Max approaches Taylor, who turns around to face her.''

'''Taylor:''' Hey, Max...

'''Max:''' Me neither. I didn't think you'd be so upset considering how much shit you and Victoria gave Kate...

'''Taylor:''' I'm my own person, not Victoria's bitch. Hello, like, she's freaking too. She already broke curfew tonight. ''[gasps]'' Shit, I'm not supposed to tell anybody...

''Max leaves the bathrooms.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' ''[sighs]'' Victoria isn't here... Maybe I'll just wait and bide my time...going through her shit.

''Max enters Victoria's room.''

==== '''Victoria's Room''' ====
''Max opens the door to Victoria's room and goes inside. The lights in the room are all turned off, so Max uses the flashlight on her phone.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Since I've crossed the line from snoop to detective, I might as well search for clues about what really happened to Kate at the Vortex Club party.

''Max searches Victoria's room. After finding nothing of importance, she leaves the room.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' ''[sighs]'' Nothing to see here... I guess I shouldn't be so bummed. Not that Victoria couldn't hide her shit... Man, ''(chuckles)'' I'm getting paranoid.

''Max enters Dana's room.''

==== '''Dana's Room''' ====
''Max enters Dana's room through the open door. Dana has the lights on and is sitting on her couch, looking distressed.''

'''Chloe:''' This sucks ass! Goddamn door! ''[punches the door]''

'''Max:''' Try not to wake up everybody at Blackwell!

''Max receives a text message from Warren with instructions.''

'''Chloe:''' Sorry, Max, I got nothin'. What about your plan?

'''Max:''' I'm gonna go put it together. Can you stay here and not get caught?

'''Chloe:''' I might get on the other side of that door before you, Lupin.

'''Max:''' The race is ON. See you soon.

''Max and Warren text each other about the instructions for building a pipe bomb. Max leaves the room to gather the four objects: sugar, a soda can, duct tape, and sodium chlorate.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Warren is such a classic nerd. Let's see if I can find those items...

''Max approaches the vending machine, inserting a coin and pressing the button for soda.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Release the kra-can!

''The soda can falls to the bottom slot and Max takes it.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' It's all mine anyway...

'''Max:''' ''(thinking) [after getting first item]'' Only three more items to go!

''Max enters the science lab.''

=== '''Science Lab''' ===
'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Gross, I HATE that formalin smell...

''Max can look at Warren's exam grade on the desk. Warren's grade will differ depending on how much Max helped him in the previous episode. Max has the option to increase his grade.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' You deserve WAY more than this for taking on Nathan, but...every little grade counts...

''Max takes the box of sugar from the end of the desk.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Ooh, sugar.

'''Max:''' ''(thinking) [after getting second item]'' You're halfway home, Max!

'''<u>Optional Photo</u>'''

''Max looks at the fish in the aquarium.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Everybody's asleep... I hate to wake them up, but...I want a picture.

''Max turns on the light in the aquarium.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Good evening, fish-fish.

''Max takes a picture of the fish with her camera.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Thanks, fish. Nice work.

''Max can turn off the light in the aquarium.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Please resume your slumber.

''Max approaches one of the desks in the back of the room. She looks at page of a science textbook talking about sodium chlorate. The book mentions that it is "commonly used as a weedkiller".''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' So sodium chlorate is...a weedkiller. ''[scoffs]'' You'd think Warren would've told me that factoid.

''Max goes to the back of the science lab. She looks at the container of weedkiller on the top of one of the cupboards.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Here's the sodium chlorate box.

''Max reaches her hand up to take the sodium chlorate, but withdraws it.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' You know you're clumsy, Max. Don't waste your rewind power. Use the damn chair!

''Max drags the chair over to the cupboard and steps up on it to take the sodium chlorate. Max returns the chair to its original position.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking) [after getting third item]'' Only one more ingredient left...

''Max enters the the photography lab.''

'''<u>Max's Optional Comments About the Contest Pictures</u>'''

'''Kate's entry'''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Oh, Kate...even when you were sad you tried to see the good in the world... Shit.

'''Victoria's entry'''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Victoria...that is pretty fucking sweet. How can I hate somebody that shoots like that?

'''Daniel's entry'''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' Daniel's a better illustrator than photographer... ''[scoffs] (sarcastically)'' Said Max the art critic.

'''Nathan's entry'''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' I feel gross even LOOKING at Nathan's work... ''(reluctantly)'' But he does have some style...

''Max goes to the back left corner of the room and takes the duct tape next to the printer.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' The tape is mine!

'''Max:''' ''(thinking) [after getting last item]'' Now it's time to show Chloe that Max is da bomb!

'''<u>Conversation with Chloe</u>'''

'''Max:''' ''[leans down and puts her hand on Chloe's shoulder]'' Take it easy on the door, Chloe. ''[she and Chloe stand up]'' Let's try this instead. ''[shows Chloe pipe bomb]'' Boom! Literally.

'''Chloe:''' Yes! Time to blow shit up!

''Max attaches the pipe bomb to the door handle.''

'''Max:''' If you'll light the candle...

'''Chloe:''' This is so cool!

''Chloe leans down and uses her lighter to light the fuse on the pipe bomb. Max and Chloe back away from the door.''

'''Max:''' Get ready to haul ass.

''Max and Chloe run to the side and crouch down behind the desk. The bomb explodes and the door is blasted open.''

'''Chloe:''' That...was so fucking cool!

''An alarm goes off.''

'''Max:''' Oh, we are toast! Here comes the whole Arcadia Bay Fire and Police Department!

'''Chloe:''' Uh, so what should we do?

''Max enters the principal's office and rewinds to before she and Chloe blasted the door open.''

'''Chloe:''' ''(from behind the door)'' If I can get this bastard open she can't cheat with her rewind... This is bullshit! Fuck you, door!

''Max opens the door from the inside.''

=== '''Principal's Office''' ===

'''Max:''' Welcome to my domain.

'''Chloe:''' You are magic! I have no clue how the hell you got in there, but you did it, sista! ''[grabs Max arms, then lets go]''

'''Max:''' The company I keep... Now, let's find what we want and beat it. My powers only go so far.

'''Chloe:''' Man, I can see why the principal locks this room up. Fancy faux art crap. He must want everybody to know he has money...but no taste.

''Chloe approaches the principal's desk and turns on the lamp.''

'''Chloe:''' How can you trust somebody who has a fucking bronze bird in his office? I'm glad I was expelled...

'''Max:''' ''(sarcastically)'' Yes, if only the principal had a Monet or Picasso you'd still be at Blackwell...

'''Chloe:''' Eat me. ''[starts searching the desk]'' I'm gonna pilfer the papers on this ugly-ass desk.

''Chloe sits down in the chair behind the desk and leans back.''

'''Chloe:''' Okay, sure, it's ugly, but damn, is it a cozy chair!

''Chloe puts her feet up on the desk and swivels side to side in the chair.''

'''Chloe:''' This is your chance to truly get all deductive 'n' shit, Sherlock! ''[takes feet off desk]'' Find us some clues about Rachel...or Kate...or Nathan...anybody!

''Chloe begins searching the computer.''

'''Max:''' I'm on the case.

''After searching through the files.''

'''Max:''' ''(thinking)'' I think we found everything in here... I should go join Chloe now.

'''Chloe:''' Max, you better come check out these files...

'''Chloe:''' Nathan accused Rachel of bringing drugs on campus? And my step-troll went along because he thinks Rachel was a bad influence on me.

'''Chloe:''' Assholes.

'''Max:''' If David is teaming up with Nathan Prescott... That's a bad sign.

'''Chloe:''' "Nathan Prescott the Third." Oooh, he's so money. And you know the Prescotts dropped major bank to bury Nathan's real file... Look, it reads like a rap sheet---bad grades, teacher complains, secret probation... But I was expelled?

'''Chloe:''' That's... fucked up. What does this even mean? Nathan is truly psychotic. I know he has something to do with Rachel missing...

'''Max:''' Whoa, listen to this, "David M. always asks what's going on in my head... David M. always helps me follow those he follows..." Pretty cryptic

'''Chloe:''' No, it sounds like they've formed some sort of weird team---"The Super He-Bros."

'''Max:''' Jesus, David was stalking Kate, hassling me, and now we know he was all over Rachel too...

'''Chloe:''' Oh, we are so going into his garage files... Plus I'm getting a little paranoid in here. We got our info, let's bail. But maybe we shouldn't leave without a gift...

'''Max:''' No, you are not taking the cozy chair.

'''Chloe:''' Max, do your powers include mind-reading?

'''Chloe:''' Or did you just rewind because I tried to steal the chair? Shit, I'm confused.

'''Max:''' It's the powers of best friendship. I know how you roll... We should definitely get out here. We pressed our luck enough.

''Chloe opens a drawer underneath the computer and discovers an envelope.''

'''Chloe:''' Hullo, what have we here? Holy shit, jackpot! Cha-ching!

'''Max:''' Wowser, that's a lot for the "handicapped fund."

'''Max:''' And books from Powell's.

''Chloe enters and walks over to the pool.''

'''<u>Optional Conversation with Chloe</u>'''

'''Max:''' You're so obvious. And I still get freaked out by that movie, so stop. I can't even watch any of those shark shows.

''Max and Chloe start splashing water on each other.''

'''Chloe:''' Cheater!

''Chloe lies on her back. Max does the same slightly later.''
