The city of '''Los Angeles''' is a recurring theme throughout ''[[Life is Strange]]''.

== Background ==
*[[Chloe Price]] dreamed of going there with [[Rachel Amber]] before Rachel's disappearance in early 2013. Chloe borrowed a lot of money ("Three grand plus interest") from [[Frank Bowers]] in order to make this journey.
*Unbeknownst to Chloe, Rachel would have left [[Arcadia Bay]] with Frank (possibly to Los Angeles).
*Rachel once asked a [[Truck Driver|truck driver]] if he could drive her to Los Angeles.
*[[Mark Jefferson]] tells Max that "Los Angeles would have killed [Rachel] anyway."
*Before the [[Storm|storm]] blew[[Frank's RV| his RV]] into the side of the [[Two Whales Diner]], Frank was about to make the drive to Los Angeles to try and find Rachel.

== Trivia ==
[[File:Welcome_to_HELL-a-Poster.png|right|thumb|200px]]
* A "Welcome to L.A." poster can be found on the wall of the hideout. It seems to have a triple pun as a result of the graffiti:
**Welcome to HELL.
**Welcome to HELLA.
**Welcome to HELL A.
