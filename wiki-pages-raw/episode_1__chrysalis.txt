== Reception ==

*On Metacritic, it currently has a Metascore 75/100 and a User Score of 8.2.
*IGN gave it a pretty mediocre 6.5 calling the writing awful.

== Trivia ==
* The term "{{Wiki|Pupa#Chrysalis|Chrysalis}}" is the name of the pupa life stage of butterflies, and so refers to a metamorphosis undergone by butterflies. Figuratively, it refers to the beginning of Max's journey and coming-of-age story. 
** On page 8 or Max's diary, in reference to the butterfly analogy, she writes: ''"At least I'm trying to climb out of my cocoon. I shouldn't expect my life to completely change after a few weeks of Blackwell Academy."''
* The episode was originally titled, "Episode 1: American Chrysalis".<ref>[https://www.esrb.org/ratings/Synopsis.aspx?Certificate=10016105&Title=Life+Is+Strange+%u2013+Episode+1%3A+American+Chrysalis ESRB Rating]</ref>
*"Home sweet home. My favorite cocoon." - Max's comment when her bedroom is shown for the first time, a reference to the episode's title. Max also writes in her diary that at least she is trying to come out of her cocoon, in another reference to the title.
* The beginning of "Chrysalis" mirrors, albeit marginally, the beginning of Remedy Entertainment's ''{{Wiki|Alan Wake}}''. In their dreams, both Max Caulfield and Alan Wake believe the point of safety is a lighthouse seen in the distance. 
* Artistic Director Michel Koch revealed in an interview that they wrote Episode 1 with the intention of introducing the typical high school stereotypes, before building upon them with every episode. "When we started to create every character, we really wanted to use known archetypes that people see in teenage drama and in movies."
* Animation files indicate that originally there was going to be an option to help Warren when Nathan starts beating him on the parking lot, which would lead to Max hitting Nathan in the face before driving off with Chloe instead of jumping straight into her truck.<ref>See ''[http://chloepriceprotectionsquad.tumblr.com/post/139826628249 here]'' for the animations.</ref>
*Famous [[Artistic References|photographers]] mentioned throughout "Chrysalis" are: {{Wiki|Diane Arbus}}, {{Wiki|Robert Frank}}, {{Wiki|Louis Daguerre}} and the {{Wiki|Daguerreotype|Daguerreotypes}}, {{Wiki|Robert Cornelius}}, {{Wiki|Henri Cartier-Bresson}} and his book "The Decisive Moment", {{Wiki|Annie Leibovitz}}, {{Wiki|W._Eugene_Smith|Eugene Smith}}, {{Wiki|Richard Avedon}}, {{Wiki|Robert Capa}} and his famous photograph, "The Falling Soldier", {{Wiki|Robert Doisneau}}, {{Wiki|Steve McCurry}}, {{Wiki|David_Hamilton_(photographer)|David Hamilton}}, {{Wiki|Philip-Lorca diCorcia}} and {{Wiki|Julia Margaret Cameron}}.
* A scene from this episode varies only slightly from promotional material: After being scratched by Max on the parking lot, Nathan Prescott shows red marks on his cheek. In a promotional shot for this episode, these scratches are not visible.
