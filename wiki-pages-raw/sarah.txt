}}'''Sarah''' is a minor character who appears in "[[Episode 4: Dark Room|Dark Room]]" as a [[Vortex Club]] member guarding the entrance to the VIP section of the [[End of the World Party]] at the [[Blackwell Swimming Pool]].

== Personality ==
Judging from her treatment towards [[Maxine Caulfield|Max Caulfield]], Sarah appears to have a snobbish attitude towards non-Vortex Club members.

According to [[Courtney Wagner]], Sarah thinks of herself as important as she "thinks she's [[Victoria Chase|Victoria]]".

== Episode Four - "[[Episode 4: Dark Room|Dark Room]]" ==
When Max approaches the curtains leading to the VIP section of the End of the World Party reserved for Vortex Club members, Sarah refuses to admit her even if Max is on the list, not believing Max has special guest access. She claims she is just a stand in for Courtney, and that it's not her responsibility to let people in.

<tabber>On the Guest List=<h5 style="display:none">On the Guest List</h5> If Max got herself on the guest list in "[[Episode 2: Out of Time|Out of Time]]", when Max mentions to Courtney that her "minion" wouldn't let her into the VIP section, Courtney crosses her arms and claims that Sarah is out of the Vortex Club for her arrogance. Courtney then proceeds to confront Sarah with Max. Courtney tells Sarah that she herself had given Max special guest access to the VIP Vortex Club section and that Sarah was out of the Vortex Club. After her expulsion from the Vortex Club by Courtney, Sarah gives off a saddened look as Max is granted entry to VIP section.

|-|Not on the Guest List=<h5 style="display:none">Not on the Guest List</h5> If Max was not actually on the guest list, or alters the list to put her own name on, nothing in particular happens to Sarah, as Courtney knows Max was not on the list, making a comment about how surprising it is that Max was even at the party. Max must find a different way to enter the VIP area.
