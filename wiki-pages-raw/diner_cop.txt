== Episode Two - "[[Episode 2: Out of Time|Out of Time]]" ==
[[File:Officer_diner.png|thumb|left]]
He sits at the counter in the [[Two Whales Diner]]. When [[Maxine Caulfield|Max Caulfield]] talks to him he comments that she looks a little lost, to which she can respond that she is hungry or that she has been here many times and that the diner is like a fourth home. He wishes he could make the diner his first home because of [[Joyce Price]]'s cooking. Then he comments that Max looks like [[Chloe Price]]'s age, to which she can start three different conversations, either about Chloe, Joyce or [[David Madsen]] or say that she has to go.
Max suspects him to be friends with David, to which he responds that he wouldn't use that word, they just know each other.

At the end of the conversation he tells Max to certainly stay away from [[Frank Bowers]]'s [[Frank's RV|RV]] parked in the parking lot of the diner. When Max tells him she usually stays away from "sketchy vehicles", the man says that Frank is pretty sketchy himself.

While Max is having breakfast with Chloe, he gets a call on the radio, but his partner takes it and leaves without him. This is one of the events Max has to predict in order to prove [[Rewind|her power]] to Chloe.

== Episode Five - "[[Episode 5: Polarized|Polarized]]" ==
[[File:Officer_diner_nightmare.png|thumb]]
In the timeline where Max wins the [[Everyday Heroes Photo Contest|Everyday Heroes Contest]], the diner cop and two other policemen are seen arresting [[Jefferson]], and later uncovering Rachel Amber's body in the [[American Rust Junkyard|junkyard]].

He appears in the diner scene of [[Max's Nightmare|Max's nightmare]], sitting at the counter at the same place as in "[[Episode 2: Out of Time|Out of Time]]".

In the Sacrifice Arcadia Bay ending, he is presumed to have died in the storm.

== Trivia ==
*The Diner Cop is similar to the character Dale Cooper from the television show ''{{Wiki|Twin Peaks}}'', who also very consistently praised pies from the local cafe. It's possible that this could be one of the many [[References (Life is Strange)|references]] made to the show in ''Life is Strange''.
