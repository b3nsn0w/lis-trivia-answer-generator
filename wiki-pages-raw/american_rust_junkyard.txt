'''American Rust''' is [[Arcadia Bay]]'s junkyard located next to the [[Train Tracks|train tracks]]. It is considered by [[Chloe Price]] as her "home away from Hell."

Chloe and [[Rachel Amber]] spent a lot of time here, as evident from their [[hideout]] in a wrecked outhouse which is covered in their belongings and graffiti.

It is an explorable area in [[Episode 2: Out of Time|Episode 2]] and is featured again in [[Episode 4: Dark Room|Episode 4]]. The junkyard is also featured in ''[[Life is Strange: Before the Storm|Before the Storm]]'', the prequel to the events of ''[[Life is Strange]]''.

== Episode Two - "[[Episode 2: Out of Time|Out of Time]]" ==
[[File:Full view junkard.jpg|thumb|220x220px]]
In this episode, Chloe and her best friend, [[Maxine Caulfield|Max Caulfield]], hang out in the junkyard to practice shooting with [[David Madsen]]'s stolen gun. Chloe asks Max to find empty bottles for a make-shift gun range while she sets it up and drinks.

Max has to explore the junkyard to find bottles hidden around the garbage. After bringing the bottles back to Chloe, Max assists her with aiming at the bottles using her [[Rewind|rewind power]]. The two girls destroy the range and an old car. It is possible here for Chloe to accidentally shoot herself after shooting the car bumper, as the bullet will bounce back and strike her in the chest. Max rewinds to save her, and the scene continues.

Max passes out from overuse of her power and has a conversation with Chloe about Rachel before having her turn with the gun. Before she can use the weapon, the girls are interrupted by [[Frank Bowers]], who followed the girls to the junkyard and heard the noises of breaking glass and gunshots. Max hides the gun behind her back. He threatens Chloe, asking for his money back. She gets angry with him after seeing he is wearing Rachel Amber's bracelet, and he pulls a knife on her. Max reacts instinctively and points the gun at Frank. She has the choice to shoot him or not shoot him.

<tabber>Don't shoot Frank=<h5 style="display:none">Don't shoot Frank</h5>Max decides to not shoot Frank.  He slowly approaches Max and ultimately takes the gun from her and then leaves. Chloe initially complains about Max not sticking up to Frank but ultimately tells Max that she is happy things went down as peacefully as they did. She would really just rather still have the gun to protect herself from Nathan.
|-|Shoot Frank=<h5 style="display:none">Shoot Frank</h5>Max attempts to shoot Frank.  The gun is already out of bullets and makes an audible click as she pulls the trigger. Frank warns Max that he will never forget her face as she almost shot him and leaves. Chloe cheers about Max being a badass.</tabber>

The two girls then leave the junkyard after the encounter with Frank and head off towards the train tracks which lie parallel to the junkyard.

== Episode Four - "[[Episode 4: Dark Room|Dark Room]]" ==
In this episode, the girls head to the junkyard after seeing pictures in the [[Episode 4: Dark Room (Location)|Dark Room]] of Rachel Amber with [[Nathan Prescott]] lying dazed and drugged among the garbage. Chloe recognizes the spot and rushes there with Max. They discover the body of Rachel Amber and retch at the foul smell of decay. The [[doe]] once again appears as Max comforts Chloe.

The girls return once more to the junkyard after a text from Nathan about him disposing of Rachel's body. They return to the spot to discover the body is still present. However, before they can act, Max is drugged with a needle in the neck which subdues her rewind power. Chloe is then shot in the forehead by [[Mark Jefferson]], and the episode ends.

Max can explore the junkyard instead of following Chloe if players wish. The [[lighthouse]] can be seen in the distance giving off its usual light. In Chloe and Rachel's hideout, there may be a [[Easily_Missed_Details_(Life is Strange)#You.27re_All_Gonna_Die|message on a wall]], which is influenced by Max's decision earlier in the game of whether or not to add her name to the wall next to Rachel and Chloe's.

An owl crosses the path of Max and Chloe during their walk towards Rachel's burial site. This owl is thought by some to be symbolic of Mr. Jefferson's spirit animal and is representative of oncoming death in many instances of folklore across the world. This would make sense when considering that Jefferson's next appearance will be after Chloe's death. Interestingly, owls feature in [[Michel Koch]]'s favorite TV show, ''{{wiki|Twin Peaks}}'',<ref>Michel Koch is a big fan of the ''Twin Peaks'' series, which he [https://youtu.be/7DGgxSbRWio?t=14m5s refers to in a 2015 Gamespot interview] as his favorite series of all time, hence the great influence on ''Life Is Strange''. See ''[[References (Life is Strange)|here]]'' to look at the numerous works that influenced ''Life Is Strange'', including the ''Twin Peaks'' series.</ref> where they are believed to be vessels for evil spirits.<ref>A well-known phrase from ''Twin Peaks'' is "The owls are not what they seem." The meaning of this has been widely debated by fans of the show for many years. The following [https://garmonblogzia.wordpress.com/2016/04/07/the-owls-are-not-what-they-seem/ Article] summarizes some of the most popular owl theories in ''Twin Peaks''.</ref>

== Trivia ==
* The junkyard's name "American Rust" might be a reference to {{Wiki|Philipp Meyer}}'s same-titled novel ''{{Wiki|American Rust}}''. ''American Rust'' is a novel "of the lost American dream and the desperation--as well as the acts of friendship, loyalty, and love--that arises from its loss."<ref>https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4251902-american-rust</ref>
* The junkyard was inspired by real locations in the Oregon area. At [[Michel Koch]]'s Masterclass interview<ref>http://www.cite-sciences.fr/fr/ressources/autour-du-jeu-video/masterclass/masterclass-de-michel-koch/</ref> some of those images that were used as a reference are shown. [[File:Train.png|thumb|180px|Train illustration from [[Max's Diary|Max's diary.]]]]
*  The train that passes by in "Out of Time" has the number 1337. It later appears derailed on the [[Two Whales Diner]] street in "Polarized" as a consequence of the [[storm]].
* Near to the spot where Max first notices the doe, there is a "piece of clothing" - a punk-rock shirt similar to Rachel's style - torn and hanging near the spot. If she interacts with this clothing, she will say, "This was an old-school punk shirt..." The game asset for this shirt is named ''TX_Fab_JnkRachPnk_D'', which suggests that it indeed belonged to Rachel Amber.
*The number on the bus in the junkyard is "142". This is likely a reference to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stampede_Trail#Bus_142 Bus 142], a derelict bus that once sat along the Stampede Trail near Denali, Alaska. Adventurer and hiker [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_McCandless Chris McCandless] lived out of this bus for several months while attempting to live off the land, before eventually dying of starvation. Chris's story is the subject of Jon Krakauer's book ''Into the Wild'', and a film adaptation of the same name.
