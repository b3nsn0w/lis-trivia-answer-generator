'''Megan Weaver''' was [[Chloe Price]]'s close friend in the [[Alternative Timeline (Life is Strange)|alternative timeline]]. She and Chloe spent a lot of time together after [[Maxine Caulfield|Max]] left for [[Seattle]].

She also wrote a postcard to Chloe after her accident, sending her apologies, which proves their close relationship:

{{Bigquote
|Dear Chloe, I am so sorry<br>
for what happened. Know<br>
that I am here for you if<br>
you need anything. I hope<br>
you feel better and I hope
to see you again.

xoxo Megan
}}

The two became more distant afterwards, Chloe feeling abandoned by her, commenting that after the accident Megan was "too cool for school".

In the [[timeline|original timeline]], the name "Megan" appears on one of the red folders in the [[Dark Room (Location)|Prescott Bunker]], which implies that Megan was a [[Dark Room Victims|victim]] of the [[:Category:Dark Room Conspiracy|Dark Room Conspiracy]]. During the [[Square_Enix_Extra_Life_Livestream_(November_2015)|Extra Life Stream]], it was confirmed that both Megans refer to the same person.

If the same is true in the [[Alternative Timeline (Life is Strange)|alternative timeline]], it could be a contributing factor towards her stopping attending school and abandoning Chloe after her accident.
