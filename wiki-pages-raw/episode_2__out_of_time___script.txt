This article is a '''script''' for [[Episode 2: Out of Time]].

=== '''Girls' Dormitories''' ===

==== '''Max's Room''' ====
''Max's alarm clock rings, and she presses snooze. She lies in bed listening to music.''

''Max gets up.''

'''Max (thinking):''' Being a superhero is dirty work. I need a shower.

''Max takes the shower supplies on top of the drawer next to her closet.''

'''Max (thinking):''' Okay, Max, let's hit the showers now!

''Max leaves her room.''

==== '''Hallway''' ====
''Victoria stands in the doorway of her room talking to Courtney.''

'''Victoria:''' Courtney, seriously, do not forget I need those papers before tonight. Like, now. Thanks, ''cherie''.

'''Courtney:''' Yeah, of course, Victoria. I'll get the tests and papers to you this afternoon. I am so on it. Consider it done.

''Courtney walks off and Victoria closes her door.''

''Alyssa is hit in the head with toilet paper thrown by a student in the bathroom.''

'''Alyssa:''' Ow!

'''<u>Optional Conversation with Alyssa</u>'''

'''Max:''' You okay, Alyssa?

'''Alyssa:''' Immature assholes... Sorry Max, I'm not feeling social right now.

''Max rewinds, then warns Alyssa.''

'''Max:''' Alyssa, can you stand over there?

'''Alyssa:''' Uh, okay, Max. If that makes you happy...

''TP is thrown but misses Alyssa.''

'''Alyssa:''' Wow, now that was close. Thank you, Max.

'''<u>Optional Conversation with Alyssa #2</u>'''

'''Max:''' Why, hello again, Alyssa.

<tabber>Warned Alyssa from the football=<h5 style="display:none">Warned Alyssa from the football</h5>

<blockquote>

'''Alyssa:''' Okay, Max, that's twice you've saved me from a projectile weapon. Are you my guardian angel?

'''Max:''' Hardly, I just have a sixth sense for trouble. I'm glad to help you out.

|-|Didn't warn Alyssa from the football=<h5 style="display:none">Didn't warn Alyssa from the football</h5>

<blockquote>

'''Alyssa:''' Damn, that was quick thinking, Max.

'''Max:''' I'm glad my psychic skills saved you from that toilet paper beatdown.

</blockquote>

</tabber>

'''Alyssa:''' Blackwell has a surplus of assholes. Oh by the way, Warren said you borrowed his epic film flash drive. I didn't know you were a sci-fi geek like us. What's your favorite?

<tabber>"Looper"=<h5 style="display:none">"Looper"</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' "Looper" was very cool. Seriously plays with your mind. I'm still trying to figure it out...

|-|"Back to the Future"=<h5 style="display:none">"Back to the Future"</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' I love "Back to the Future," of course. But who doesn't?

'''Alyssa:''' Can you imagine going back in time to Blackwell in the 1980s?

'''Max:''' We'd suffocate from all the hair spray.

</blockquote>

|-|"Groundhog Day"=<h5 style="display:none">"Groundhog Day"</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' I love the idea of going back in time to fix mistakes in "Groundhog Day."

'''Alyssa:''' I barely want to go forward in time, much less go backward.

'''Max:''' I hear you. But it's all about the choices you make now.

</blockquote>

</tabber>

'''Alyssa:''' You and Warren do know your sci-fi. Be careful, you might make Brooke jealous...

'''Max:''' I'll just pretend I have no idea what you mean.

'''<u>Conversation between Juliet and Brooke</u>'''

''Juliet shows a video on her phone to Brooke.''

'''Juliet:''' Gross. The Vortex Club are such pigs. I'm glad I pissed them off.

'''Brooke:''' I didn't think Kate was like this… macking on those bros? Ew.

'''Juliet:''' We shouldn't be watching this.

'''Brooke:''' Everybody's seen it by now.

''A moment later, Max is able to have conversations with Juliet and Brooke.''

'''<u>Optional Conversation with Juliet</u>'''

''Juliet is in the hallway until Max takes a shower. After Max takes a shower, Juliet can be found in Dana's room. This conversation can take place in either location.''

'''Max:''' Hello, Juliet.

'''Juliet:''' Hey, Max, did you check out Kate's hot video yet?

<tabber>Why?=<h5 style="display:none">Why?</h5><blockquote>'''Max:''' Why should I?

'''Juliet:''' Because it's fucking hilarious. "Church Girl Gone Wild."</blockquote>

|-|That's not cool.=<h5 style="display:none">That's not cool.</h5><blockquote>'''Max:''' That's so not cool.

'''Juliet:''' I didn't get wasted on camera and get busy with the Vortex Club.</blockquote>

</tabber>

'''Max:''' Kate's not like that and you know it.

'''Juliet:''' Really? Check her out and tell me what she's like.

'''Max:''' Do you believe everything you see? Like Zachary sexting Dana?

'''Juliet:''' Touche. Now I feel like an ass. Thanks for finding out the truth yesterday.

<tabber>What about Victoria?=<h5 style="display:none">What about Victoria?</h5><blockquote>'''Max:''' What did you do about Victoria pulling that crap?

'''Juliet:''' Nothing...yet. My mind works in devious ways too.</blockquote>

|-|Are you sure?=<h5 style="display:none">Are you sure?</h5><blockquote>'''Max:''' Are you sure? I thought you'd be pissed...

'''Juliet:''' Not at you. Part of me was almost disappointed, because I built up so much rage.</blockquote>

|-|What about Zachary?=<h5 style="display:none">What about Zachary?</h5><blockquote>'''Max:''' What about Zachary? Did you let him off the hook?

'''Juliet:''' When he acts like a worm, I let him dangle.</blockquote>

</tabber>

'''Max:''' Glad to see you're back in action.

'''Juliet:''' You have a good heart, Max... And I won't watch Kate's video anymore. Or pass it on.

'''Max:''' That's the spirit! Thanks, Juliet.

'''Juliet:''' Sure, talk to you later.

''If Max tries to talk to Juliet again''

'''Juliet:''' I'm not watching the video, Max.

'''Juliet:''' Excuse me, I'm texting Zach.


'''<u>Optional Conversation with Brooke</u>'''

'''Max:''' Hey, Brooke.

'''Brooke:''' Oh, hi, Max.

<tabber>Did you see the snow?=<h5 style="display:none">Did you see the snow?</h5><blockquote>'''Max:''' Did you see the freak snowfall yesterday?</blockquote>

|-|You look distracted.=<h5 style="display:none">You look distracted.</h5><blockquote>'''Max:''' You look distracted. Everything cool?</blockquote>

</tabber>
'''Brooke:''' I was riveted by that weird snow flurry yesterday.

'''Max:''' I can't tell if you're being serious or not... Um, since I'm a science noob, I was wondering if you could explain it...

'''Brooke:''' I'm serious. Even meteorologists can't explain that snow. I bet Warren can. Did you talk to him yet?

<tabber>I will later.=<h5 style="display:none">I will later.</h5><blockquote>'''Max:''' I will later.

'''Brooke:''' Lucky you. I'm sure he'll track you down, Max. I'll see you around.</blockquote>

|-|No.=<h5 style="display:none">No.</h5><blockquote>'''Max:''' No, not at all. He's my friend, not my mother.

'''Brooke:''' True. And Warren really loves to talk meteorology with me, since I'm one of the few who can talk back. Talk to you later, Max.</blockquote>

</tabber>

''If Max tries to talk to Brooke again''

'''Brooke:''' I don't have time, Max. I can't talk now.

'''Brooke:''' Really, Max?

==== '''Showers''' ====
''Max enters the shower room. Kate is seen facing a mirror, brushing her teeth.''

'''<u>Conversation with Kate</u>'''

'''Kate:''' Max!</blockquote>
}}

'''Max:''' Oh! Uh... Hey, Kate. Sorry about yesterday.

'''Kate:''' Yeah, I'm sorry you didn't do anything to help. But you're just like everybody else here...

'''Max:''' That's not true, I wanted to help, but, but--

'''Kate:''' Whatever, it's done...</blockquote>

'''Kate:''' Hey Max!</blockquote>
}}

'''Max:''' Hey, Kate. How are you doing?

'''Kate:''' I'm here. Thanks again for standing up for me yesterday. I needed that.

'''Max:''' Anytime. That guy has issues.

'''Kate:''' Doesn't everybody here?</blockquote>

</tabber>

'''Kate:''' By the way, Max, do you still have my copy of "The October Country"?

'''Max:''' Oh. Yes, of course. It's great so far. I didn't realize Bradbury was such a poet.

'''Kate:''' Can you please bring it back to my room this morning? I just need to take some notes for class.

'''Max:''' Absolutely. I'll bring it by later.

''Max begins to take a shower.''

''Victoria and Taylor enter and approach Kate.''

'''Victoria:''' What's up, Kate?

'''Kate:''' School.

'''Taylor:''' That's it?

'''Victoria:''' That video of you clubbing didn't look like homework...

'''Kate:''' Victoria, that wasn't me...

'''Taylor:''' Oh, my God. Right.

'''Victoria:''' Don't be shy. I think it's awesome you set a tongue record on video...

''Taylor laughs.''

'''Kate:''' You're going to be sorry someday.

''Kate leaves.''

'''Victoria:''' Oh, boohoo, I'm sorry you're a viral slut. I'm sure she had fun.

'''Taylor:''' Looks like it.

'''Victoria:''' I know Nathan hooked her up. And you know he has the good shit.

'''Taylor:''' Preach it, sista.

''Victoria examines herself in the mirror.''

'''Victoria:''' Yuck. I still have goddamn paint all over my face.

<tabber>Made fun of Victoria=<h5 style="display:none">Made fun of Victoria</h5><blockquote>'''Victoria:''' "Max Selfie" thought she was a badass taking that picture. I shoulda beat her down.

'''Taylor:''' That was so uncool.

'''Victoria:''' She's jealous because Mark--Mr. Jefferson knows I'm going to win the "Everyday Heroes" contest. He thinks Max is a joke.</blockquote>

|-|Comforted Victoria=<h5 style="display:none">Comforted Victoria</h5><blockquote>'''Victoria:''' Good thing my faithful minions took their sweet time bringing me a towel...

'''Taylor:''' We ran all the way--

'''Victoria:''' Give it a rest, Taylor. Now I know if I'm in an accident I won't rely on you or Courtney for help. You can hang out with Kate...or Max.</blockquote>

</tabber>

'''Taylor:''' She's a weirdo with that dumb camera.

'''Victoria:''' I hate that "I'm so quirky" crap. Anyway. Let's leave the link to Kate's video so everybody gets a chance to see her in action...

'''Taylor:''' You are such an evil beeatch. I love it!

''Victoria pull out a tube of lipstick and writes the link to the video of Kate on the mirror.''

''Taylor laughs, then she and Victoria leave.''

''Max puts her PJs back on and steps out of the shower.''

'''Max (thinking):''' I better get dressed, then go give back Kate's book.

''Optional: Max washes her face at the sink.''

'''Unknown female student (from inside the shower):''' Hello?! Water!

'''Max:''' Sorry, I forgot!

''Optional: Erase the link written on the mirror.''

'''Max (thinking):''' Even if I can stop one person from watching it, it's worth it.

''Max leaves the bathroom and returns to her own room (if Max left Victoria's photos in the rearranged state, Max's slate will say "LOOK AT ME: I AM MAX SELFIE!" and show a drawing with a photo of a turd. Max can erase this and draw a new picture on her slate).''

==== '''Max's Room''' ====
<tabber>Reported Nathan and/or made fun of Victoria=<h5 style="display:none">Reported Nathan and/or made fun of Victoria</h5><blockquote>

''Max's room will be vandalized if she did either of the above.''

'''Max (thinking):''' No fucking way! This is not why I came to Blackwell. And I still have to clean all this crap up? After I find Kate's book...

''Reported Nathan: "NOBODY MESSES WITH ME BITCH" will be written in red letters over Max's selfie wall. There will also be a defaced photo of Max on her bed.''

''Made fun of Victoria: "CRAPPY ARTIST FILTHY WHORE" will be written on Max's mirror and the photo of Victoria covered in paint will be stolen.''

''In both instances some of Max's stuff will be scattered near her bed.''

''Max can clean up her room by:''
* ''Putting away the defaced photo of herself (only if she reported Nathan)''
* ''Tidying up the mess near her bed''
'''Max (thinking):''' Ta da! I do love a clean room. Very zen. Except for that bullshit graffiti.</blockquote>

|-|Didn't report Nathan or make fun of Victoria=<h5 style="display:none">Didn't report Nathan or make fun of Victoria</h5><blockquote>

''Max's room will be untouched.''</blockquote>

</tabber>
''Max gets dressed at her closet.''

'''Max (thinking):''' Maybe I'll just put on a shirt and jeans. Hey, Einstein had the same exact suit for every day of the week. And he couldn't even rewind time.

''Optional: Max searches for Kate's book in the clutter on her couch.''

'''Max (thinking):''' No book here...

''Optional: Max searches for Kate's book in the clutter at her desk.''

'''Max (thinking):''' My desk is a pigsty, but...I know it ain't there.

''Optional: Max searches for Kate's book in the clutter on the floor.''

'''Max (thinking):''' And nothing here.

''Max searches the clutter on the end table next to the couch. She lifts up a piece of paper and finds the book, but accidentally spills a cup of soda all over it.''

'''Max (thinking):''' Of course you just spilled soda on Kate's book. Better fix this fast. Kate needs the book and I don't want to add to her list of problems.

''Max rewinds, then moves the cup.''

'''Max (thinking):''' Begone, foul soft drink!

''Max takes the book.''

'''Max (thinking):''' Aha, you sneaky book, you're mine! Now I can finally take this back to Kate before I'm late. As if I have to worry about being late anymore... I do have all the time in the world now.

''Max leaves her room.''

''Kate's slate will have insults written on it. Max can erase them.''

''Max knocks on Kate's door.''

'''Max:''' Kate? You in there?

'''Kate (from inside her room):''' Yes, I'm here. Come in, Max...

==== '''Kate's Room''' ====
''Max enters and explores Kate's room. She then talks to Kate.''

'''<u>Conversation with Kate</u>'''

'''Max:''' Uh, hey, Kate, I brought your book...

</tabber>

'''Max:''' Kate, I actually do care. So, what's the story with you and David?

</tabber>

'''Kate:''' Do you know how humiliating this is for me?

'''Max:''' I know this sucks, Kate, but...tell me about the video and maybe I can help.

'''Kate:''' Basically, I went to one Vortex Club party and ended up making out with a bunch of people...and I have no memory of it...

<tabber>Why would you go?=<h5 style="display:none">Why would you go?</h5><blockquote>'''Max:''' So, why would you go?

'''Kate:''' It's a long story. I'm still trying to sort it all out...</blockquote>

</tabber>

'''Max:''' You have to tell me more than that. What happened at the party? Did you drink?

'''Kate:''' I swear to God I had one sip of red wine. And then I drank water.

<tabber>Are you sure?=<h5 style="display:none">Are you sure?</h5><blockquote>'''Max:''' Are you sure it was just one sip?</blockquote>

|-|Not enough to get wasted.=<h5 style="display:none">Not enough to get wasted.</h5><blockquote>'''Max:''' Not enough to get wasted, is it?

</tabber>

'''Kate:''' I take a sip at church and I don't end up on a viral video, okay?

'''Max:''' Did somebody drug you?

'''Kate:''' I remember...I remember getting sick and dizzy...

'''Max:''' Go on...

'''Kate:''' Then Nathan Prescott said he would take me to the hospital...

<tabber>Did you go?=<h5 style="display:none">Did you go?</h5><blockquote>'''Max:''' Did you go?

'''Kate:''' Definitely not. I'm not sure where I went...

'''Max:''' What do you remember about that?</blockquote>

|-|Nathan Prescott!=<h5 style="display:none">Nathan Prescott!</h5><blockquote>'''Max:''' Nathan Prescott? Oh, shit!

'''Kate:''' He was being nice for a change when he offered to help me.

'''Max:''' He's the opposite of nice. What next?</blockquote>

|-|How sick were you?=<h5 style="display:none">How sick were you?</h5><blockquote>'''Max:''' How sick were you?

'''Kate:''' Sick enough to need a doctor. I thought I was dying, Max.

'''Max:''' So, Nathan didn't take you to the ER?

</blockquote>

</tabber>

'''Kate:''' All I recall is driving for a long time...then I woke up in a room...I thought it was a hospital because it was so white and bright...

'''Max:''' Go on, I'm listening.

'''Kate:''' Somebody was talking to me in a soft voice...I thought it was a doctor...until I heard Nathan and felt a sharp sting in my neck...and...and...

<tabber>And?=<h5 style="display:none">And?</h5><blockquote>'''Max:''' And?</blockquote>

|-|Are you sure?=<h5 style="display:none">Are you sure?</h5><blockquote>'''Max:''' Are you sure?

'''Kate:''' Of course--you think I'm making this crap up? Why?

'''Max:''' No, I'm just...being deductive. As usual. Then what happened?</blockquote>

</tabber>

'''Kate:''' That's all I remember! I don't know what happened... I woke up outside my dorm room the next day. I didn't have any marks or bruises, but I felt gross.

'''Max:''' So, who took the video of you at the party?

'''Kate:''' I have no idea. Probably Victoria. She was there being her mean self.

'''Max:''' Jesus, Kate, I'm sorry. This is serious shit.

'''Kate:''' How do I get a viral video taken down? I know it's already spreading--what if my church sees that? I need to know what to do...

'''Max:''' Kate, we'll figure it out. I'll check back later, okay?

'''Kate:''' Thanks, Max... You can put my book here, near my bag.

''Max places the book next to Kate's bag.''

'''Kate:''' So, Max, can I ask you a question? And please be honest.

'''Max:''' Absolutely, Kate. Anything.

'''Kate:''' I need to find out if Nathan Prescott helped me...or hurt me after that party. Should I go to the police?

<tabber>GO TO THE POLICE=<h5 style="display:none">GO TO THE POLICE</h5><blockquote>'''Max:''' Yes, you should definitely go to the police, Kate. I totally believe every word you say. Nathan Prescott is truly dangerous.

'''Kate:''' Bless you, Max. I will go to the police...and also Principal Wells. With you as my back-up witness, they'll have to take us seriously now.

'''Max:''' Back-up witness? Well, I mean, I believe you and everything, but...we're still just spoiled punk students to the cops and faculty... I just think we need to be very careful here...

'''Kate:''' Why? Careful of what?

'''Max:''' Nothing...except the Prescotts are a powerful family. I hope this won't backfire on us, that's all. Even though that rich bastard has earned some serious bad karma. He'll get it...

'''Max (thinking):''' Time out, Max. You actually told Kate to go to the police and the Principal...after getting a scary text threat. Now the police will definitely drag you into this shit.</blockquote>

|-|LOOK FOR PROOF=<h5 style="display:none">LOOK FOR PROOF</h5><blockquote>'''Max:''' If you do that, they won't believe you. You're on video grabbing at all those guys and they'll use that against you. Bad.

'''Kate:''' But I know I was drugged--

'''Max:''' That's what you have to prove. Not them. I'm just telling you how the cops and school will look at this. The video doesn't exactly back you up...

'''Kate:''' You make me feel so hopeless--

'''Max:''' No, no, Kate. I just don't want you to get hurt any more...

'''Kate:''' That seems impossible at this point. So that's your answer?

'''Max:''' I think we should wait. There are other things going on that might help you.

'''Kate:''' But not right now. So I can walk down the halls with people calling me a viral slut. Thanks, Max.

'''Max (thinking):''' Good job, Dr. Max. She didn't like what I had to say, but we need more proof of what happened.</blockquote>

'''Max:''' That's awesome, Dana.

'''Dana:''' At least we're showing our faces together in public... So you absolutely should go with us. Borrow one of my outfits and come as a cute geek couple with your bitch Warren...

'''Max:''' It's Kate Marsh, from Blackwell...

'''Chloe:''' Big whoop. You don't call me once in five years and now you're all over some beeatch you see every day at school? I see how you roll. So go ahead, chat up Kate Marsh from Blackwell. I've got other people to hang out with too.

'''Max:''' You are ridiculous. I'm chiling with you, okay?

'''Chloe:''' For now. Let's rock.

'''Nathan:''' Kate had a double life. I was super shocked when I found out.

'''Max:''' No, you were part of the crowd. And like I said, I personally saw David physically harass Kate Marsh.

'''Nathan:''' She shouldn't have asked to be on video macking with some dudes...

'''Max:''' You ass. She didn't ask for any of this...

'''Jefferson:''' No, on the contrary. Max was right to bring this up. Now, I wanted to help, but I guess I was too late...

'''Principal Wells:''' Well now, this is problematic. The publicity is rising and perhaps... you shouldn't represent Blackwell at the "Everyday Heroes" contest in San Francisco...

'''Jefferson:''' Are you serious?

'''Principal Wells:''' I am. We don't need any negative press about that event. And we need to involve the Academy in possible disciplinarian measures for you.

'''Jefferson:''' I understand. There are bigger things at stake than me. The life of a young girl for one...

''Principal Wells slides a document toward Max.''

'''Principal Wells:''' All right, Miss Caulfield, please sign here to confirm what you've told us. I'll continue this investigation from there.

'''Max (thinking):''' ''My head is killing me, but I think I can use my power again.''

''Max signs the statement.''

'''Principal Wells:''' Well, I think we know less now than when we started. We'll be assisting the police with further inquiries. I know this has been a stressful day... I wish I had the power to change it all for the better... So, thank you for coming in.

''Everyone but Principal Wells leaves the office.''

=== '''Main Campus - With Warren''' ===
''Max and Warren sit together on the Main Campus at sunset.''

<tabber>Saved Kate=<h5 style="display:none">Saved Kate</h5><blockquote>'''Max:''' I couldn't even believe it was happening. It was literally slow motion as I grabbed her hand...and then I could feel her grabbing mine...

'''Warren:''' Max, that was the greatest thing I've ever seen! Ever! You reached out, she reached out...hugs, tears, applause! Like a superhero!

'''Max:''' Not quite. Look at me, I'm a mess.

'''Warren:''' You're glowing. Seriously! A human halo. I'm pretty sure you earned your wings today.

'''Max:''' I'm still worried about Kate. She did try to kill herself. All over a video...

'''Warren:''' "Viral" is the right word. Like a disease.

'''Max:''' So, you watched it?

'''Warren:''' Just one...and a half times...</blockquote>

'''Warren:''' Come on, Max. Do not for a second blame yourself. Kate was on that roof for her reasons, not yours.

'''Max:''' My hand just reached out...

'''Warren:''' Stop it. You were the only one with balls enough to run to the roof. You were the only one who cared.

'''Max:''' Yeah, I sure made a big fucking difference. Maybe if more people cared...better people than me...

'''Warren:''' You're the best person around...

'''Max:''' Warren, I screwed up today.

'''Warren:''' That makes no logical sense.</blockquote>

</tabber>

'''Max:''' Warren, I don't mean to sound weird, but there's something ominous going on at Blackwell...

'''Warren:''' Today proves that.

'''Max:''' And I'm working on proof that Kate Marsh is connected to Rachel Amber...somehow. Along with Nathan and Mr. Madsen.

'''Warren:''' I'm not a big conspiracy guy, but I wouldn't doubt it. Nathan did scare me yesterday and Madsen is a straight-up dickhead. So...what do you think is really happening?

'''Max:''' What the hell is this...?

''Max and Warren look at the sky, where the setting sun is suddenly eclipsed.''

'''Max:''' The weather confirms this weird day... Feel that chill...

'''Warren:''' Max, there was no eclipse scheduled today... I would know. I would.

''Max rubs her arms, feeling cold. Warren moves closer and wraps his arms around her.''

'''Max:''' I believe you, Warren... I'll believe anything this week...

=== '''Epilogue''' ===
''David and Joyce hold hands in the backyard of their house, talking. Joyce hugs David.''

''Principal Wells argues with Jefferson in his car. Jefferson drives away.''

''Victoria is crying on her bed, her face buried in her hands. Nathan opens the door.''

''Frank sits on a rock at the beach, petting his dog next to him.''

''Chloe sits alone on the bench at the lighthouse cliff. She's smoking and holding her cellphone in her hand, waiting for Max to reply to her messages.''

'''Chloe (SMS):''' Sorry about Kate. I hope you're ok.

'''Chloe (SMS):''' This eclipse freaks me out...

'''Max (SMS):''' Let's find out what's going on!

'''Max (SMS):''' Together!

''A row of red binders are shown. The binders have various female names written on them. The last one in the row says "RACHEL." Another binder, labeled "KATE," lies on a table. Next to it is a photograph of Kate on a piece of paper with writing all over it. Other than the name "Kate Marsh," the writing on this paper is illegible. A pen, X-ACTO knife, tube of glue, two containers of prescription pills, and a half-full glass of alcohol are also placed on the table.''
