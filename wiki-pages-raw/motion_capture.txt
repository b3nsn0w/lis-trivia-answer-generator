'''Motion Capture''' technology was actively used in ''[[Life is Strange]]''.

== Overview ==
The motion capture for ''Life is Strange'' was realized by a French company called [http://www.mocaplab.com/projects/dont-nod-life-is-strange/ Mocaplab]. The whole process took only four days, equivalent of a feature film shoot.

The motion capture was used to help in animating the two main characters [[Maxine Caulfield|Max Caulfield]] and [[Chloe Price]], and a few others like [[Nathan Prescott]] or [[Warren Graham]].

Max's motion capture actress was [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6002849/ Serena de Mouroux] while the actress playing Chloe was [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4787948/ Gabrielle Hersh].

== Trivia ==
* Due to [[Deck Nine Games]] already owning a motion capture studio, Mocaplab is not part of ''[[Life is Strange: Before the Storm]]'' (the actresses/actors being also different). It is yet unknown if Mocaplab will be involved with the [[Season 2|sequel]] to ''Life is Strange''.
