}}'''Alice''' is [[Kate Marsh]]'s pet rabbit. She is seen staying in [[Kate's Room|her room]] at [[Blackwell Academy]] during [[Episode 2: Out of Time|Episode 2]] when Max is returning a book to Kate. In [[Episode 3: Chaos Theory|Episode 3]], Alice, her cage, and her carrot supply are moved to [[Maxine Caulfield|Max Caulfield]]'s room in order for her to take care of Alice while Kate is in the hospital/after Kate's suicide.

== Episode Two - "[[Episode 2: Out of Time|Out of Time]]" ==
Alice lives in a cage in Kate's room. Max can take an [[Optional Photos|optional photo]] of her and will regard her as the "cutest bunny ever." She thinks that Kate takes good care of her. 

== Episode Three - "[[Episode 3: Chaos Theory|Chaos Theory]]" ==
Following Kate's suicide (attempt), Alice will be moved to [[Max's Room|Max's room]]. Max will either tell her that Kate will be back soon or that she is her "new mommy" from now on. Max has the opportunity to feed Alice with carrots before exiting her room to meet up with [[Chloe Price|Chloe]].

Provided that Max managed to save Kate from killing herself, Kate will later [[Max's_Messages#Kate_3|message]] Max about missing her and Alice. Max will reply that everyone at Blackwell, including Alice, misses her, too.

== Episode Four - "[[Episode 4: Dark Room|Dark Room]]" ==
Kate will mention Alice and reveal her name to Max while having a conversation with her in the hospital. Kate will thank Max for taking care of Alice and will ask Max to tell Alice she will be seeing her soon.

== Trivia ==
[[File:Easter_Eggs_Info.png|thumb|Drawing of Alice from Max's diary|90px]]
* The name Alice might be a [[References (Life is Strange)|reference]] to the white rabbit in [[Wikipedia:Alice in Wonderland|''Alice in Wonderland'']] that leads Alice to Wonderland.
* There is a drawing of Alice on page 34 of [[Max's Diary|Max's diary]] on her entry about Kate's suicide attempt, since Max is taking care of Alice afterwards.
