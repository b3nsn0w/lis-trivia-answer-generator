== Jefferson Exhibition ==
There was an exhibition for Mark Jefferson's work there from November 5 - December 1, 2009. It emphasizes his fame by stating that he is an "international photographer".

On October 7th, 2013 during [[Episode 1: Chrysalis|Episode 1]], [[Maxine Caulfield|Max Caulfield]] can find a leaflet for the exhibition in [[Victoria Chase]]'s [[Victoria's Room|bedroom]] in the [[Prescott Dormitory]]. An advert in the leaflet gives the owner a dollar off entry to the exhibition.

Victoria clearly has a passionate admiration for Jefferson's work due to her hanging on to the leaflet for sentimental purposes.

== Location ==
It is presumed to be around [[Arcadia Bay]]; however, the leaflet only states that it's a "local exhibition." This could mean it is local to Victoria's home city of [[Seattle]].

A [[media:Note3-pool-lostgoggles.png|lost property ad]] can be found inside [[Blackwell Academy]]'s [[Blackwell Swimming Pool|swimming pool]] building in "[[Episode 3: Chaos Theory|Chaos Theory]]" which could suggest the cafe isn't too far away from Blackwell due to a monetary reward to use in the cafe being offered by a student.

== Trivia ==
*The above-mentioned ad for lost swimming goggles was written by student Ray Siren and offers eternal gratitude plus a $25 gift card to use at the Bean Hip Cafe as a reward for returning them.
