{{Stub}}The following '''Unused Text''' is found in the subtitle strings within the localization files. This includes unused dialogue or letters.

== Letters ==
Two letters located in [[Nathan Prescott]]'s [[Nathan's Room|dorm room]] in [[Episode 4: Dark Room|Episode 4]] were removed from the game.

=== Jefferson's Letter ===
(E4_5A_NathanRoom_JeffersonLetter_SP01)
 Dear [[Sean Prescott|Mr. Prescott]],
 
 As a photography teacher at [[Blackwell Academy]], it’s my privilege to meet many talented 
 and ambitious students who I believe will all reach their goals in one way or another. 
 This is a realistic view of today’s highly limited and competitive art market -- and a 
 pragmatic POV I stress in my lectures. I can say with as much validity as my awards and 
 experience are worth to you, that Nathan Prescott has one of the finest eyes for 
 photography I’ve ever encountered at Blackwell. Talent without passion or commitment 
 can be a great hobby, but not a career. To be blunt, Nathan has been very lax this 
 semester about turning in his assignments and his erratic behavior in class has been 
 noted by faculty and students. 
 
 Even though Nathan is a legal adult, I feel that as his father and Blackwell 
 benefactor, you know your son better than anybody here and would appreciate the spirit 
 of my concern for his well-being. On the academic side, Nathan must turn in all of his
 remaining assignments for his portfolio within two weeks in order to pass the class and 
 retain his excellent GPA. 
 
 Thank you for your time and I’m always available to talk if you have any questions. 
 
 Best, 
 [[Mark Jefferson]]

'''[[Maxine Caulfield|Max Caulfield]]'s comment:''' ''"Damn, Mr. Prescott sure doesn’t own Mr. Jefferson...yet. Does he think Nathan has a better eye than me?"'' (Act_E4_5A_NathanRoom_JeffersonLetter_Max_010)

=== Wells' Letter ===
(E4_5A_NathanRoom_WellsLetter_SP01)
 Dear Nathan,
 
 I wanted to drop you a note to say that if you’re having any issues with classes or 
 [[Prescott Dormitory|dorm]] life, you can always come to my office, or I can recommend wiser folks than 
 myself to lend a helping ear. I’d like to think you know I have your best interests 
 at heart despite some our of past disagreements.
 
 Blackwell Academy should bring out the best in our students and vice versa, so if you 
 feel that isn’t the case, let’s work together to find the right solution. I know 
 school can be a challenging time in a young person’s life (especially given your 
 Prescott legacy) but you have many options available here at Blackwell.
  
 Again, please drop by anytime if you’d like to discuss this in person and of course, 
 our conversation would be strictly confidential.
  
 Sincerely
 [[Raymond Wells|Ray Wells]]

=== Nathan's Poster ===
(E4_5A_NathanRoom_ExhibitionPoster_SP01)

Text to describe a poster seen on display in Nathan's room does not display on the poster when looking at it. Only stylized lines can be seen which symbolize additional text.<ref group="note">This line = text conclusion is based on the presentation of other posters in the game that, upon closer inspection, can reveal text where the lines are.</ref> 
The unused text could have been intended for the poster to originally appear as a [[Max's Notes|note]] rather than something Max just comments on as she does in the game.

== Dialogue ==
=== Episode 3 Campus ===

'''Max (thinking):''' I do need a break from the [[Chloe Price|Chloe]] Rollercoaster... And I just want to help her...

''Mr. Jefferson crosses Max's path when she is on her way back to dorm.''

'''Jefferson:''' Max, can I talk to you for a moment?

'''Max:''' Uh, sure, Mr. Jefferson.

<tabber>(Saved Kate)=<h5 style="display:none">(Saved Kate)</h5><blockquote>

'''Jefferson:''' I just wanted to remind you how proud we all are of you for helping [[Kate Marsh|Kate]].

'''Max:''' Thanks, but I didn't do much. She just needed somebody with her...

'''Jefferson:''' You are truly modest, Max. Aside from the selfies. But give yourself some credit. Hey, you alright?

</blockquote>

|-|(Didn't save Kate)=<h5 style="display:none">(Didn't save Kate)</h5><blockquote>

'''Jefferson:''' I just wanted to see how you were doing.

'''Max:''' I'm okay. It's hard to focus on much after what happened...

'''Jefferson:''' I know. I'm truly sorry for [[Kate Marsh|Kate]] and that you all had to see that. If you want, there are counselors available.

</blockquote>

</tabber>

'''Max:''' I just feel weird about what happened in the Principal's office yesterday...

<tabber>(Accused Jefferson)=<h5 style="display:none">(Accused Jefferson)</h5><blockquote>

'''Jefferson:''' When you accused me of making Kate cry?

{{#tag:tabber|Yeah.=<h5 style="display:none">Yeah.</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' Yeah... I feel shitty about you not getting to do the "[[Everyday Heroes Photo Contest|Everyday Hero]]" contest... Do you hate me now?

'''Jefferson:''' Honestly, Max? I was burned out on the contest. You think I'm a pretentious artist here, imagine me in [[San Francisco]]... I'm still rooting for you though.

'''Max:''' Thanks, Mr. Jefferson. But a career in photography seems as far away now as San Francisco... I'm just not confident.

</blockquote>

{{!}}-{{!}}No.=<h5 style="display:none">No.</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' No... but I don't know why I did that...

'''Jefferson:''' Max, if I was as confused as you I might have done the same thing. But I honestly only tried to help Kate.

{{#tag:tabber|I saw you with Victoria.=<h5 style="display:none">I saw you with Victoria.</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' I also saw you and [[Victoria Chase|Victoria]] talking last night...

'''Jefferson:''' Who needs a surveillance system when you have Max Caulfield and her camera eye? And, it's none of your business.

</blockquote>

{{!}}-{{!}}How did you help Kate?=<h5 style="display:none">How did you help Kate?</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' How did you try to help Kate? She ran away crying...

'''Jefferson:''' Max, I'm not an "Everyday Hero." I just tried to help Kate, but she didn't want my advice, okay?

</blockquote>

}}

'''Jefferson:''' You might be the nosiest student in the history of Blackwell.

'''Max:''' I know, I know, it's a bad habit.

</blockquote>

}}

|-|(Accused Nathan successfully)=<h5 style="display:none">(Accused Nathan successfully)</h5><blockquote>

'''Jefferson:''' You mean getting [[Nathan Prescott]] expelled?

'''Max:''' Yes. And now, I expect him to come after me...

{{#tag:tabber|(Reported Nathan)=<h5 style="display:none">(Reported Nathan)</h5><blockquote>

'''Jefferson:''' Since you reported him for having a gun as well, I want you to be careful around here. Not to scare you.

</blockquote>

{{!}}-{{!}}(Hid the truth)=<h5 style="display:none">(Hid the truth)</h5><blockquote>

'''Jefferson:''' Well, I think Nathan is more bark than bite. Don't let him scare you.

'''Max:''' Too late. I'm not always that brave.

|-|(Accused Nathan unsuccessfully)=<h5 style="display:none">(Accused Nathan unsuccessfully)</h5><blockquote>

'''Jefferson:''' You mean accusing [[Nathan Prescott]] of drugging Kate?

'''Max:''' He drugged Kate. I know it.

'''Jefferson:''' Since you reported him for having a gun as well, I want you to be careful around here. Not to scare you.

'''Max:''' Too late. I'm not always that brave.

|-|(Accused David successfully)=<h5 style="display:none">(Accused David successfully)</h5><blockquote>

'''Jefferson:''' About [[David Madsen]] losing his Blackwell privileges?

'''Max:''' He deserved it. So why do I feel guilty?

'''Jefferson:''' Because you have a good heart, Max. Nothing to feel guilty about. But don't waste that feeling on Madsen. Pardon my French, but he's fucking asshole. Don't let him scare you.

'''Max:''' Too late. I'm not always that brave.

</blockquote>

|-|(Accused David unsuccessfully)=<h5 style="display:none">(Accused David unsuccessfully)</h5><blockquote>

'''Jefferson:''' When you accused [[David Madsen]] of bullying Kate?

'''Max:''' Yes. Even though he absolutely did.

'''Jefferson:''' I absolutely believe you-as you can tell, I'm not a fan of his work. Don't let him scare you.

'''Max:''' Too late. I'm not always that brave.

</blockquote>

</tabber>

'''Jefferson:''' I hope that's not a fatal character flaw... Wouldn't want to deprive the art world of your vision.

<tabber>My selfies?=<h5 style="display:none">My selfies?</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' Oh, you mean my silly retro selfies? The art world would only laugh.

</blockquote>

|-|Me neither.=<h5 style="display:none">Me neither.</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' Me neither. It just seems like another world.

</blockquote>

|-|What "vision"?=<h5 style="display:none">What "vision"?</h5><blockquote>

'''Max:''' What "vision"?

</blockquote>

</tabber>
<tabber>(Max got suspended)=<h5 style="display:none">(Max got suspended)</h5><blockquote>

'''Jefferson:''' Once you get back from your suspension, we're going to talk about your future in photography, cool?

</blockquote>

|-|(Max didn't get suspended)=<h5 style="display:none">(Max didn't get suspended)</h5><blockquote>

'''Jefferson:''' We need to sit down soon and talk about your future in photography, cool?

</blockquote>

</tabber>

'''Max:''' It's so hard for me to see the future when I'm always looking backwards...

'''Jefferson:''' Regret and nostalgia can be a dangerous combo. You can't change the past, Max. You just have to accept your choices and "walk on." Which is my clever exit cue.

=== "Rough Cut" Dialogue ===
Some very rough dialogue labeled "Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01" exists for the "[[Blackwell Parking Lot|Parking Lot]] - Focus" chapter within the subtitle files. No audio exists for this "rough cut". The dialogue contains spelling errors along with pacing and grammatical issues that suggest it may have been written by somebody whose first language is not English and somebody who may not have performed an official writing role. This rough scene may have been written as a guide for the [[Christian Divine|writer]] to polish up into the impactive dialogue we now hear in the game. The full block of dialogue is as follows (Note that Cue_E5_6A_Parking_CHChloe_Phase01_[Max/Chloe]_003 to 005 is missing):
