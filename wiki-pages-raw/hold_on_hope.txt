== Lyrics ==
: If morning has spoken, you know it won't be our last
: As the light wakes the city we'll stand tall and raise our glass
: We won't let go of hope
: Or let go of our dreams

: When all is forgotten the defeat won't give us the past
: Now just show me the memory
: For god sake lets make this last

: Please don't let go of hope
: Or let go of your dreams, no

: Hold on hope
: And if the world lets go
: I say hold on hope
: I will carry you home

: These words we have spoken I swear they won't be the last
: Together escaping the shackles of our past
: We won't give up on hope
: Won't give up on our dreams

: Please don't let go of hope
: Or let go of your dreams, no

: Hold on hope
: And if the world lets go
: I say hold on hope
: I will carry you homeï»¿
