'''Max's Diary''' is a section of [[Max's Journal|Max's journal]] and contains 73 double pages which record [[Maxine Caulfield|Max Caulfield]]'s happenings and exploration in [[Arcadia Bay]], beginning on July 10, 2013, when she is accepted into [[Blackwell Academy]] and ending on October 11, 2013. Max keeps it updated throughout the game, keeping track of everything that has happened thus far. It offers further insight about Max's thoughts, motivations, doubts or fears, which are revealed to the player this way. The diary changes depending on the [[Choices and Consequences|choices]] that are made by the player.

==Prologue==
===<u>July 10, 2013</u>===

<blockquote>''I GOT ACCEPTED INTO [[Blackwell Academy|BLACKWELL ACADEMY]].''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''If words could dance this would be a rave<ref>A rave describes any gathering of people centered around listening to and dancing to electronic music.</ref>. Even though I've never been to one. But who cares because I GOT INTO BLACKWELL ACADEMY!<ref group=note>The sentence continued as follows prior to the release of Episode 5 (before 1.0.0.371598): "..., a unique and famous private school for seniors! NO KIDS ALLOWED!"</ref> I didn't think I would be so excited since it's not like I didn't used to live in the same town. But when I saw the text from the Blackwell scholarship office, I could literally feel my pulse speed up.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''I thought it was going to say, "Sorry! Thanks for playing!" It took me a few seconds before I read the whole thing. I guess I wanted to enjoy that last moment of blissful ignorance. And when I saw the first word, "Congratulations..." I think I screamed.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''My [[Vanessa Caulfield|mom]] cried, and my [[Ryan Caulfield|dad]] laughed. They're so weird. But they're happy and this means extra financial support because they don't have to pay anything to Blackwell. This means new clothes and if I can work it, a new laptop.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Oh, and I have to keep telling myself in caps that I AM GOING TO BLACKWELL ACADEMY.''</blockquote>

===<u>August 18, 2013</u>===
[[File:Max_Diary_(2).jpg|thumb]]

<blockquote>''So this is it. I'm leaving Seattle to go back to Arcadia Bay. Usually people go to the High School closest to home. I suppose I am too, it's just I haven't lived there for 5 years. Out of all the best photography programs in the world, I choose to go to the smallest, back in a town I was excited about leaving.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Maybe I wanted to come back all along, just to see if [[Chloe Price|Chloe]] and I are still even friends. But I do wish Chloe could have moved with us to Seattle... That city was made for her. When we would play pirates in our rooms and in the woods, it seemed like Seattle was that fabled faraway island of treasure and adventure that we were always seeking. With coffee shops.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''But Seattle wasn't like a fable. Au contraire. Now Blackwell Academy seems more exotic to me than any other place in the world. To study photography under [[Mark Jefferson]]... SIGH. Insert hearts and flowers. Plus there will be cool diverse students from everywhere. It won't be like my high school now... I never really found a groove with my classmates. (Or boys...) I'm lucky I have a couple great friends here. But it's time to ship out.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''So maybe Arcadia Bay will actually turn out to be the island of treasure and adventure I've been looking for...''</blockquote>

=== <u>August 25, 2013</u> ===
[[File:Max_Diary_(3).jpg|thumb]]

<blockquote>''Shit is krazy here. I didn't realize how much crap I had to pack until I had to pack all my crap. Mom and Dad are gettin' a little too excited I'm clearing out my room. Tho I caught mom crying when she was packing my shirts.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''That made me want to cry like a little girl. And never leave Seattle. So instead of packing, I feel like burning all my clothes, then just raiding a thrift store to build up a new Max wardrobe over my junior year. Not that I even have an old Max wardrobe.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Nobody will know me except for Chloe and who knows how different we are now. So I can cut my hair, get a tat and some piercings... Maybe date a cute foreign exchange artiste from Paris or Rome. I can do anything. Unless I get busted.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''And there will be so many supercool chances for my photography to get exposed! Thinking about that is when I get scared, but excited. And then I don't feel like crying at all. I get tingles down my arms, sensing the universe opening up for me. I can't wait to leave.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''I just want things to be... different at Blackwell.''</blockquote>

===<u>September 2, 2013, 12:07am</u>===
[[File:Max_Diary_(4).jpg|thumb]]

<blockquote>''My first entry from my new dorm room the night before my first day at Blackwell. Whew! I haven't had any time to write or even take pictures since I got here. My shit is in boxes all over the room, which is small, but mine, and I never want to leave. I can't wait to decorate! I plan a whole wall o' photos. I did meet some of my dorm mates, tho I suck at remembering names so I won't bother right now. But I think I can already see who's going to be cool to me and who's not. It's a bitch trying to get settled into a new school and social scene after I finally found good friends in Seattle.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''But I'm here now, and this is the start of my new life. Sweet dreams.''</blockquote>

===<u>September 3, 2013</u>===
<blockquote>''Blackwell sucks ass! I told myself not to whine so soon, but damn... The day started like Christmas morning. I barely had any dreams because I was so pumped to start my first official day of my new life. Like a dork I couldn't figure out what to wear, so I chose what was on the floor. I'm no good with names and faces right away, but I picked up some names like [[Kate Marsh|Kate]][[Brooke Scott|Brooke]][[Taylor Christensen|Taylor]][[Alyssa Anderson|Alyssa]]...''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''And how could I forget [[Victoria Chase]]? Rich, stylish, entitled. I could feel INSTANT JUDGMENT when she looked at my raggedy ass clothes. As if I'm at Blackwell to strike fashion poses... Maybe I'm being extra crispy sensitive, but I think Victoria wants life here to be like her own reality show. Ugh...''</blockquote>

[[File:Max_Diary_(5).jpg|thumb]]

<blockquote>''So that wasn't fun along with my general social unease... I thought it would be easier being back. Call the waaahmbulance! I don't want this day to end all "Woe Is Max". It was incredible to walk across the green campus in the morning mist. I love the stone steps and brick walls of Blackwell. Everything is a picture waiting to be taken... Speaking of, at least one great thing did happen today: Mr. Jefferson's photography class. Sigh...''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''There's more to tell but journal, forgive me, I'm truly wiped out.''</blockquote>

=== <u>September 4, 2013</u> ===
<blockquote>''I have an assload of homework already. So much bullshit. At least give us noobs a day to acclimate. But, to prove I'm not a total loser, I made a new friend in my science class. His name is [[Warren Graham]] and he's a serious geek, plus he's dark and witty.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''He comes across as kind of a know-it-all, but it turns out he does kind of know a lot. We talked about photographers, and he actually named a few I'd never heard of. We traded numbers and he'll be a good study partner (or a good friend). I'll need at least one based on the clique action here. I thought being 18 meant I didn't have to deal with this teenage drama anymore. I THOUGHT.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''At least I get to research famous photographers for some of my homework. Mr. Jefferson assigned us a ton of reading, but this is exactly what I want to study. Jefferson is supercool and superchill.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''He doesn't try to be too hip, just says what he thinks and expects us to as well. I think he's a genius. OMG I WANT TO MARRY HIM. Just joking. This one class is worth all the social dysfunction.''</blockquote>

=== <u>September 15, 2013</u> ===
[[File:Max_Diary_(6).jpg|thumb]]

<blockquote>''Homework is kicking my ass. I bet the teachers grade harder just to stop you from feeling special. But [[Victoria Chase]] and her snob minions still front like they're honored guests of Blackwell. The bros here aren't that different. [[Nathan Prescott]] is Victoria's male clone, with way more money and attitude, if that's possible.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''His family is the oldest in Arcadia Bay and I heard stories about them when I was a kid. The Prescotts give a shitload of bank to Blackwell, so Nathan acts like he literally owns the school. Yesterday during class, he put his feet on the desk, started texting and the teacher didn't say jack!''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''I'd get suspended. But him and Victoria are part of this silly elite "[[Vortex Club]]" that puts on popular parties and so they get their way. It's good to be the king and queen.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''I don't want to slam everybody. I do like [[Kate Marsh]], she's down the hall and in one of my classes. She's so pretty AND sweet and friendly. It makes her more beautiful than the beeatches here like Victoria who think beauty is just your face and outfit. See? I'm already playing their drama games. No more!''</blockquote>

=== <u>September 23, 2013</u> ===
[[File:Max_Diary_(7).jpg|thumb]]

<blockquote>''Finally had a chance to take some actual shots around campus today. A perfect blue sky day. I always forget how great I feel after I take pictures when I've been slacking off. Speaking of pictures, Mr. Jefferson told us about the national "Everyday Heroes" photo contest he wants us all to enter.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''The winner gets a trip to San Francisco and lots of publicity. He wants just one photograph from each student. This is exactly why I wanted to come to Blackwell and of course I'm scared shitless to enter. At least I have a couple weeks before the deadline in October. So I have plenty of time to stress and procrastinate. Sigh.''</blockquote>

===<u>September 30, 2013</u>===
<blockquote>''I don't know whether I love it or hate it here. I'm trying to keep up with my science class of all things. Like I give a shit or even understand it. Good thing I know Warren. Too bad I can't clone him to take my place in class.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''[[Michelle Grant|Ms. Grant]] is much cooler than the class. She explains particle physics so even boneheads like me can kinda understand. I love how she relates society to science and vice versa. I can tell she's committed and passionate about life. Unlike some of us in her class, but I'm trying to engage more, even if it means asking actual questions in class instead of hiding in the back. I'm just glad I'm not the only social misfit here.''<br />''Now how much homework are you avoiding?''</blockquote>

===<u>October 1, 2013</u>===
[[File:Max_Diary_(8).jpg|thumb]]

<blockquote>''October. My favorite month. The best weather of the year. I love watching the leaves change color, turning into tiny flames. But it's still too damn hot (thanks global warming) and I can't bust out the big coats and sweaters or scary movies yet. Soon. Kate let me borrow {{Wiki|The October Country}} by {{Wiki|Ray Bradbury}}.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''I haven't read much by him (which caused Warren to almost revoke my geek cred before I held up my copy of {{Wiki|Battle Royale (novel)|Battle Royale}}) but he nails the autumn atmosphere of small towns. The last time I wore a Halloween costume was with Chloe... I have pictures in one of my old albums...''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''I should find a real Halloween party to crash so I can experience some social mingling. It's that or a Vortex Club strokefest swimming party. Or is that backstrokefest? You so punny, Max.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''At least I'm trying to climb out of my cocoon. I shouldn't expect my life to completely change after a few weeks of Blackwell Academy. As my parents love telling me on a loop, "You have all the time in the world."''</blockquote>

== Episode One - "[[Episode 1: Chrysalis|Chrysalis]]" ==

=== <u>Monday, October 7</u> ===
[[File:Max_Diary_(9).jpg|thumb]]

<blockquote>''This will be the weirdest journal entry I will ever make. So weird I don't know how or where to start. But it started with the most vivid dream of my life. I was lost in a storm by the lighthouse until I came to the edge of the cliff.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Then I saw a giant tornado headed for Arcadia Bay. It was so real that I could feel the rain stinging my face. And I was scared shitless. Then a boat hit the lighthouse and I swear I actually felt like I was going to die.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''But I woke up in Mr. Jefferson's class and I wasn't even sleeping. I almost fell out of my chair. Jefferson called on me but I totally blew the answer. Of course Victoria pounced on me and made me look like a bigger idiot. She's so awful. Then I didn't have the guts to turn in a photo for the "Everyday Heroes"<ref group=note>The contest was referred to as "Everyday Hero" instead of "Everyday Heroes" in some cases like here prior to patch [?].</ref> contest while Victoria did her usual suck-up to Jefferson. He's so cool and he clearly wants me to succeed.''</blockquote>

[[File:Max_Diary_(10).jpg|thumb]]

<blockquote>''I felt so shitty. I just wanted to get to the bathroom to be alone and wash my face after that nightmare. Or daymare. Once I got to the bathroom I saw this odd beautiful blue butterfly flutter in and right when I took a photo of it in the corner, Nathan Prescott came in freaking out, talking to himself. I hid in the corner and this punk girl came in and they started arguing about drugs and money. Then Nathan actually whipped out a gun and SHOT the girl.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''This is where it gets strange.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''When Nathan fired the gun I came around the corner and reached out for some dumb reason, as if I could stop the bullet. But suddenly I could feel the world twisting around me and this pressure in my head, everything seemed to rewind and I found myself right back in class at my desk!''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''I literally thought I had been dosed with some drug until I calmed myself down. I saw everything happen in class the way it did before. Major Groundhog Day-ja vue.''<ref>Reference to the popular movie - see
[[wp:Groundhog Day (film)|here]]</ref>'' Somehow I was able to actually rewind time.''</blockquote>

[[File:Max_Diary_(11).jpg|thumb]]

<blockquote>''I knew the only way to find out if I was having a breakdown was to go back to the bathroom and see if I could save that girl from Nathan this time. I had no idea how either. I just knew I couldn't live with myself if I let her die again. I escaped Jefferson this time by knowing exactly how to answer his questions and rushed to the bathroom.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''I hid in the corner again and I couldn't believe it when Nathan showed up, freaking out all over again.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Then the girl came into the bathroom, and before Nathan could shoot her, I smashed open the ancient fire alarm and scared both of them away. Victory!''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''...Until I got grilled by the security chief, [[David Madsen]], who thinks he's Chuck Norris: Blackwell Ranger.''<ref>Reference to the Chuck Norris film, ''{{Wiki|Walker, Texas Ranger}}''.
</ref>'' Nathan Prescott almost kills a girl in the bathroom but no, I'M THE PROBLEM. I was so glad when Principal Wells stepped in to shoo David away.''</blockquote>

[[File:Max_Diary_(12).jpg|thumb|(Determinant)]]





<tabber>Tell on Nathan=<h5 style="display:none">Tell on Nathan</h5><blockquote>''Then I made the possibly fatal decision to inform Principal Wells that I saw Nathan waving a gun in the bathroom. I didn't think I should mention the girl, or my new rewind abilities, for obvious reasons. He didn't want to believe me and almost made me feel like shit for telling him that Blackwell's most big fucking deal student would carry a firearm to class. I couldn't tell him that he actually killed a girl in a previous timeline...''</blockquote>

|-|Hide the Truth=<h5 style="display:none">Hide the Truth</h5><blockquote>''I wanted to inform Principal Wells that I saw Nathan waving a gun in the bathroom, but I didn't want to mention the girl, or my new rewind abilities, for obvious reasons. I wouldn't know how to tell him without making me look crazy. He grilled me for being out in the hall during a fire alarm. I'm still glad I didn't have to tell him that Blackwell's most big fucking deal student actually killed a girl in a previous timeline...''</blockquote></tabber>

<blockquote>''So my school day started with an apocalyptic dream then ended with saving a life and discovering I have some kind of power to rewind time. I don't know how to top that.''</blockquote>

[[File:Max_Diary_(13).jpg|thumb]]

<blockquote>''Everything feels so surreal right now. I can't talk to anybody about this, well... The only person I could, I haven't seen in five years. I could confide in Warren, he's smart and knows science, so maybe he could even think of an explanation. Though I have no idea what that could be.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Until I can figure this out, I better stay on the down low with this stuff and focus on my classes. Warren sent me a text asking for his flash drive back, even though I haven't had chance to check out all the cool shows and films on there.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''I watched a few episodes of {{Wiki|Doctor Who}} and [[wp:The X-Files|X-Files]]; binged on {{Wiki|Fullmetal Alchemist}}; then [[wp:Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!|Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!]] (all kinds of Amazon women black and white badassery); [[wp:Tetsuo: The Iron Man|Tetsuo]] (a total cyberpunk trip with amazing visuals); and [[wp:Scott Pilgrim vs. the World|Scott Pilgrim]] (for about the millionth time).''</blockquote>

[[File:Max_Diary_(14).jpg|thumb]]

<blockquote>''On a side note, I saw a "Missing Persons" poster on campus for "[[Rachel Amber]]" a pretty Blackwell student who vanished. It's so sad to see her smiling face and think about the awful things that could happen. If there was a way for me to rewind back six months, I totally would.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''I had to go back to the dorm to get Warren's flash drive and yes, Victoria and her Vortex Vixens blocked me from getting in, and even took my picture... It was so "high school movie" I can't believe she did it.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''She actually told me to "Go fuck your selfie" though, it was funny. I don't know why she has to act that way. She already has everything she wants, doesn't she? And she forced me to use my rewind until I finally came up with a way to get her out of my way. I don't want to use this power for trivial bullshit, especially if I have been given an actual "gift" from the universe, but it did give me a chance to test it out.''</blockquote>

[[File:Max_Diary_(15).png|thumb|(Determinant)]]

<tabber>Comfort Victoria=<h5 style="display:none">Comfort Victoria</h5><blockquote>''But I felt like shit seeing Victoria sitting there by herself on the steps covered in paint. She didn't look like the Queen Beeatch of Blackwell, just a lonely girl as confused as me. I knew I had to find out if she was okay. She was actually nice and apologized. She even deleted the picture she took of me off her phone. So maybe there's hope for the future.''</blockquote>

|-|Take Victoria's Picture=<h5 style="display:none">Take Victoria's Picture</h5>
<blockquote>''Still, I can't believe I took a picture of Victoria coated in paint for revenge. I must be feeling pretty brave. She vowed revenge, so I guess I've officially made my first enemy at Blackwell. ''</blockquote></tabber>

<blockquote>''More high school drama... [[Juliet Watson|Juliet]] wouldn't let [[Dana Ward|Dana]] out of her room because she thought [[Zachary Riggins|Zachary]] was sexting Dana. So stupid. I was so tired from everything, and since Dana borrowed Warren's flash drive, I had to intervene.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Juliet told me Victoria was the one who gave her the inside scoop on Zach and Dana, so I knew that Victoria was playing them all. I snuck into Victoria's room and onto her laptop and found out that she was indeed lying through her ass just to create drama. Of course, I felt like a weasel going through Victoria's room and laptop.''</blockquote>

[[File:Max_Diary_(16).png|thumb|(Determinant)]]

<tabber>Talk about the Pregnancy=<h5 style="display:none">Talk about the Pregnancy</h5><blockquote>''Once I gave Juliet the proof that Victoria was behind this, I went to get Warren's flash drive from Dana. She was in a weird mood, so I had a look around to see if I could find out why. I found a home pregnancy test along with a note from Logan and a doctor's appointment. Dana admitted she was pregnant and I realized that all of my friends have troubles that are just as significant as mine. Sigh.''</blockquote>

|-|Don't talk about the Pregnancy=<h5 style="display:none">Don't talk about the Pregnancy</h5><blockquote>''Once I gave Juliet the proof that Victoria was behind it all, I went to get Warren's flash drive from Dana. She was in a weird mood, but we said nasty things about Victoria and I think it definitely made her feel better. We talked about Warren and Dana implied he likes me. Ew.''</blockquote>
</tabber>
<tabber>Warn Alyssa=<h5 style="display:none">Warn Alyssa</h5><blockquote>''I'm starting to get the hang of this whole rewind thing. I don't want to waste this power, but there has to be a reason it was given to me, so I better learn how to use it right. I started by saving Alyssa from getting a football fueled headshot. I admit it felt amazing just to help Alyssa with something as simple as that.''</blockquote>

|-|Don't Warn Alyssa=<h5 style="display:none">Don't Warn Alyssa</h5><blockquote>''I'm starting to get the hang of this whole rewind thing. I don't want to waste this power, but there has to be a reason it was given to me, so I better learn how to use it right. I could have used it for something as easy as warning Alyssa she was going to get a football fueled headshot. How selective should I be with this power?''</blockquote></tabber>
<tabber>Intervene=<h5 style="display:none">Intervene</h5><blockquote>''I also saw David Madsen hassling Kate Marsh. I couldn't hear everything, but he was accusing her of something. All that guy can do is point fingers! I got so pissed I went over to stop him from being such a bully. He's a security guard, not a stormtrooper. He was an asshole (as usual) but I felt good about what I did and Kate seemed truly happy that somebody stood up for her. And I did that without using my rewind power.''</blockquote>

[[File:Max_Diary_(17).png|thumb|(Determinant)]]

|-|Take a Photo=<h5 style="display:none">Take a Photo</h5><blockquote>''I also saw David Madsen hassling Kate Marsh. I couldn't hear everything, but he accused her of something. All that guy can do is point fingers and I got so pissed. He's a security guard not a stormtrooper. But like the chickenshit I can be, I didn't go over and stand up for her. I was scared. Sometimes I still feel like a little kid. And yes, Kate was not happy I didn't come over to stand by her. So I let her down and my rewind power was useless.''</blockquote></tabber>

<blockquote>''This day keeps getting stranger. I don't even believe what I'm writing. And I can't even do a simple task like giving Warren back his flash drive without getting into a situation.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''In this case though, it turned out half bad and half good, which I guess is the yin and yang of life. When I met with Warren in the lot and checked out his new retro-wheels, guess who showed up? Nathan Prescott, freaking out all over again. He got all up in my face to accuse me of bullshit.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Even though I was scared because I know what he did to that girl in the bathroom, I was more furious.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Then the "girl in the bathroom" pulled up in a [[Chloe's Truck|truck]]. My former best friend, Chloe Price.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''We both looked at each other like WTF? Next thing I knew, I was in her truck as Warren earned his man card and tried to get Nathan off my ass. I owe Warren big-time. Seeing Chloe for the first time in five years was such a shock I was almost paralyzed. Especially after realizing that Nathan had almost killed her right in front of me.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Now Chloe shows up out of the blue to save me.''</blockquote>

[[File:Max_Diary_(18).png|thumb]]

<blockquote>''Of all the bizarro and unexplainable shit happening today, sitting in Chloe's battered truck, listening to music and staring at her dashboard bobblehead might be at the top.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''So I tried to process the fact that Chloe and I were two best friends who didn't know each other anymore. She had blue hair, piercings, and cool boots and I... I looked like a dork. I didn't know where to start and she wasn't exactly extending an olive branch.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''So we sat like strangers. At least I had time to catch my breath and realize that in the parking lot melee with Nathan and Warren, my camera got busted up. I didn't care considering everything else going on. But it sucked on top of everything else going on.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Going back to Chloe's old house for the first time in five years was like the ultimate rewind. Some things were obviously different, but some things weren't. The house smelled exactly the same as it did when we were growing up.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Chloe's room was like an exploded version of her new adult self, cool and chaotic. I could tell she was pissed. She wanted to blaze up and chill, so I explored her room to play catch up on what she was into these days.''</blockquote>

[[File:Max_Diary_(19).png|thumb]]

<blockquote>''Then I found a photo of Chloe with Rachel Amber. Chloe freaked and laid into me for not calling her once. I deserved it. She had become best friends with Rachel and they were going to bail on [[Arcadia Bay]] and head out to Los Angeles for fame and fortune. I could tell how much Chloe cared about Rachel since she was the one putting up the posters.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''I felt even shittier about leaving Chloe alone all those years when she most needed me. You suck, Max. But Chloe is obsessed with Rachel, the missing girl. She says Rachel vanished after meeting some amazing dude... probably some psycho online. Chloe wanted to smoke out and be alone so I went downstairs to find tools to fix my camera.''</blockquote>

[[File:Max_Diary_(20).png|thumb]]

<blockquote>''Snooping deeper, I hit the paranoia jackpot and found a whole mini-surveillance set-up of Chloe's house, with cameras in the halls and some rooms. Truly creepy shit. What kind of uber-paranoid puts cameras throughout his own home? Chloe's stepfather, I guess. I see why she's got serious attitude.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''When I got back upstairs, I couldn't fix the stupid camera. But Chloe saw the butterfly photo and knew I was in the bathroom and set off the alarm. Her attitude totally changed and she realized that I had saved her life.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Even though it could have gone the other way... She was so happy like when we were kids and it was great to see her face light up. She even gave me her dad's awesome old instamatic as a symbol of our reunion. She cranked up the tunes and started dancing on her bed like a maniac. She even got me to shake my booty. Just a bit.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''That's when Chloe's stepfather showed up. And it was David Madsen.''</blockquote>

<tabber>Don't Hide=<h5 style="display:none">Don't Hide</h5><blockquote>''I couldn't hide and then David came in, angry about the music and that I was there. He was even scarier off campus because he didn't have the school around him. He accused Chloe of taking one of his guns.''</blockquote>

''David tried to threaten me but Chloe was awesome and threatened him. He backed out of there quick. Chloe was so touched I took the blame.<br>Of course, she did steal one of David’s guns and waved it around like an idiot. Too much firepower for this girl to encounter in one day. Or one life. Fortunately, Chloe and I decided to get out of there and catch up on our exploring… like best friends.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''So Chloe and I ended up at the lighthouse, watching the sunset. Chloe was mellow and told me more about David and his uber-paranoia at school and home. It all made sense.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''But I wanted to know why Chloe was in that bathroom with Nathan Prescott. She told me he deals drugs and she wanted to blackmail him to pay off some big loan. It's so strange where our lives have gone since the last time we hung out when we were thirteen.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Then I had another nightmare. Or duskmare. I was right back at the lighthouse in a storm, except this time I was following a ghostly deer until I got to the edge of the cliff. I could see the tornado destroying everything in its path, and again I could feel the cold sting of the rain. The lighthouse was crumbling and I felt so helpless watching the tornado move towards the town.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Then Chloe snapped me out of the dream and I told her what I saw. And as if to make the day end on another unusual note, snow started falling from the sky in the warm sunset. It felt so weird, ominous and beautiful all at once.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Especially standing there with my best friend. And on that positive thought, I have officially earned a great night's sleep.''</blockquote>

=== <u>Tuesday, October 8</u> ===
[[File:Max_Diary_(23).png|thumb]]

<blockquote>''I woke up this morning a different person. Even if nobody knows yet. After yesterday's intense revelations with my rewind power and saving Chloe's life among the other cray cray (as Victoria might say say) events at Blackwell, I have to assume everything is different now. And I thought exposing my photos to the world was going to be hard.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''After Chloe dropped me off back at my dorm yesterday, I tried to find out more about that freak snowfall that happened when we were at the lighthouse, but the local meteorologists are stumped so far. I felt so jacked up that I pulled an all-nighter on time and physics research.''</blockquote>

[[File:Max_Diary_(24).png|thumb]]

<blockquote>''Not being Warren I ended up knowing less about my situation than when I started... I don't really think that my tornado vision and the snowfall are connected, but at this point I have no fucking clue what to believe. I'm just so glad Chloe and I are a team again. That has to be destiny.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Now I have to hit the showers and get ready to meet Chloe for breakfast. Lord knows I need it.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''I ran into Kate in the showers and she asked for "The October Country" back. I love that book and definitely need to get my own copy. Of course when I was in the shower, Victoria and Taylor barged in and totally started ragging on poor Kate about the video. Just to be complete assholes they wrote the link on the mirror.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''I truly don't understand how they get off on acting like that. Victoria has EVERYTHING. What does she gain by being a bully to Kate Marsh? We're supposed to be adults here, but I swear it's like "Battle Royale" - just without the dystopia and exploding heads. Only Victoria could make me feel dirty in a shower.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''The plot thickens. And I can't get out.''</blockquote>

<tabber>Hide the Truth and Make Fun of Victoria=<h5 style="display:none">Hide the Truth and Make Fun of Victoria</h5><blockquote>''So after listening to Victoria and Taylor rag on Kate about the video, I came back to my room to find it TRASHED. Or at least messier than it was before.''

''Now I have to clean up just to find Kate's book... I bet Victoria did this because of that paint photo yesterday. I should've expected swift retribution. Another day, another drama..''</blockquote>

Only Nathan would be this disturbed.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''The thought that Nathan was in here actually setting up this weird gallery is way fucked up. I better start being more careful around here. I almost want a surveillance system now.''</blockquote>
|-|Hide the Truth and Comfort Victoria=<h5 style="display:none">Hide the Truth and Comfort Victoria</h5><blockquote>''After being forced to listen to Victoria and Taylor rag on Kate about the video, I headed back to my room. I didn't really have any time to chill out, I had to get dressed and find Kate's book in my own mess, rushing all the while to not be late for Chloe.''</blockquote></tabber>

<blockquote>''As if things here weren't dramatic enough, I got a creepy text from a private number. Nathan? Victoria? No clue. I really have to start watching my back.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''I still had to give Kate's book back, so I went to her room. I knew she wasn't doing good, but I didn't know how bad until I went in. All the lights were off, blinds closed, like some emo-goth den. And Kate is the opposite of emo or goth. She was just crying in the dark, and it was so sad to see her like this. More sad is that I wished I could take a picture of her framed in her expressionist misery.''</blockquote>

[[File:Max_Diary_(26).png|thumb|(Determinant)]]

<blockquote>''Kate admitted that she thinks something more happened to her than just a video. Plus she told me that Nathan Prescott gave her a ride from the party to the ER... and she thinks he did something to her, but she doesn't remember what.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''It's hard not to believe Kate considering what kind of person she is and what kind of person Nathan is. I've seen for myself exactly what that fucker is capable of.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Of course, Kate asked if she should go to the police and the principal...''</blockquote>

<tabber>Go to the Police=<h5 style="display:none">Go to the Police</h5><blockquote>''I told Kate she should absolutely go to them. Other people could be in danger... But Kate also said she would use me as her backup, which kind of scares me because of this text threat. Should I be getting this involved when somebody is obviously stalking me or worse already? This is getting freakier than I can handle... Super Max... NOT!''</blockquote>

|-|Gather Evidence=<h5 style="display:none">Gather Evidence</h5><blockquote>''I felt like absolute shit, but I told Kate she shouldn't go to anybody until she has more proof she was drugged. That video doesn't help her case at all and this could all backfire big time. She's going up against the whole Prescott empire, not just one rich white boy on dope. She wasn't too thrilled by my answer. I don't think she trusts me to be the one investigating all this... How can I blame her? I sometimes wonder what I am actually doing, besides getting myself in more trouble... Kate even booted me out of her room. Hello, "Everyday Hero"!''</blockquote></tabber>

[[File:Max_Diary_(27).png|thumb|(Determinant)]]

<blockquote>''I ran into Warren-or rather, Warren was waiting to run into me. Naturally he wanted to know what the hell happened in the parking lot with "The Chloe and Nathan Show." Once again, I felt like a dick because I should have gotten ahold of Warren to see if he was okay after we just left him in the lot... I do owe Warren.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''I only told him a little about what was going on with Nathan. The less he knows, the better for him. I would love to at least tell him about my ability to fucking reverse time and space, but ironically I don't think it's the right time or space... Besides, he would want to marry me immediately, just so he could have his own human time machine. Or capture me for scientific experiments... Or make me go to the drive-in with him.''</blockquote>

<tabber>Agree to the movie=<h5 style="display:none">Agree to the movie</h5><blockquote>''Oh wait... I did say I would go to the drive-in with him. Hope he doesn't make a lame move on me... (Not that he would, egomaniac.) Warren and I do have a lot in common, but he's like a supercool geek brother... Anyway, I definitely need a movie escape.''</blockquote>

|-|Decline the movie=<h5 style="display:none">Decline the movie</h5><blockquote>''Oh wait. He did try and get me to go to the drive-in with him, and I refused. I'm not really in the mood this week, and I also don't want to lead him on...''</blockquote></tabber>

[[File:Max_Diary_(28).png|thumb|(Determinant)]]

<blockquote>''Before catching the bus out to meet Chloe I saw Nathan talking to David, which made me nervous. Otherwise I had a nice soundtracked ride to the Two Whales Diner. Talk about going back in time... I haven't seen the diner in five years, but it looks exactly the same. Although now there are way less fishermen and way more dumped food carts than when we were kids. Chloe and I had the best backdrop to play pirate: old ships and a big ocean.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Chloe was late (duh!) so I was happy to be distracted by seeing Joyce again. The diner is like a museum piece, except with customers. Better still, the food hasn't changed at all. Joyce seemed really glad to see me again and she didn't give me a guilt trip for not staying in touch. After William died, she wanted to move forward with a new life and husband. Chloe doesn't want to accept that.''</blockquote>

<tabber>Took the blame earlier=<h5 style="display:none">Took the blame earlier</h5><blockquote>''Joyce naturally gave me shit for corrupting Chloe with my "devil weed", though I'm not sure she even believed it was mine. What could I say? I can see she actually loves David-even if I don't see how. The breakfast was so worth the grief though.''</blockquote>
|-|Didn't take the blame=<h5 style="display:none">Didn't take the blame</h5><blockquote>''Joyce wasn't happy about Chloe getting busted with weed. I really should have stepped up and taken the hit instead of Chloe. I feel bad that Joyce has to defend David for laying the smackdown on his own stepdaughter. William was always so kind and gentle with us. Can't even imagine how Chloe would be if he hadn't died.''</blockquote>
</tabber>

[[File:Max_Diary_(29).png|thumb|(Determinant)]]

<blockquote>''So much drama and I haven't even finished my breakfast!''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Finally Chloe showed up, more bubbly than I would have thought after almost getting killed in a bathroom yesterday. It makes me happy to see her smile. But that smile meant trouble, since all she really wanted was for me to show off my rewind power. So I did and I have to admit, I felt like a total boss. Except I did start feeling weak and woozy the more I rewound. I even got a nosebleed, which kinda freaked me out.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Chloe always wants more, so she demanded we go to her top-secret lair...''</blockquote>

<tabber>Didn't answer Kate's call=<h5 style="display:none">Didn't answer Kate's call</h5><blockquote>''Kate called, but I didn't answer because Chloe was giving me the stink eye. And to be honest, I don't like Kate being so needy toward me. Even though I keep acting like I'm her spiritual bodyguard. Man, I do suck. I'll make it up to Kate. At least Chloe is happy...''</blockquote>
|-|Answered Kate's call=<h5 style="display:none">Answered Kate's call</h5><blockquote>''She still had to get pissed off at me because I dared to answer Kate's call. I'm not a fan of Chloe's petulant side. She tried to make me feel like an ass, but screw that. Kate was so happy I answered I actually felt worse for her. Chloe has to know I can have two friends at once...''</blockquote>
</tabber>

[[File:Max_Diary_(30).png|thumb|(Determinant)]]

<blockquote>''Just when I thought shit couldn't get crazier.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Chloe took me to her secret lair: the city dump. Perfect for Halloween... like where the vehicle and appliance ghosts of Arcadia Bay come to rot and rust. Urban dystopia porn. But, instead of taking cool photos, Chloe had me do some silly kinda fun gun tricks.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Until the guy Chloe owes money to showed up. Some skeevy guy called Frank. He demanded Chloe pay him back... or else. I was shocked that he wasn't the loan shark I had expected, but I could literally feel his bad vibe. I still can't see how my best friend ended up involved with a loser like Frank.''</blockquote>

<tabber>Tried to shoot Frank=<h5 style="display:none">Tried to shoot Frank</h5><blockquote>''And I almost shot him.''
''He pulled a knife on us and it felt like another one of my dreams. I don't even remember aiming the gun at him, but my finger just tapped against the trigger...Thank God there were no bullets left. I could have used my rewind, but the way my head was throbbing... who knows? I can't assume my power will always be available... I don't know anything about how this works-or how long-so I can't take anything for granted. I just know I'm never holding another gun.''</blockquote>
|-|Didn't try to shoot Frank=<h5 style="display:none">Didn't try to shoot Frank</h5><blockquote>''Things got truly crazy when Frank took Chloe's gun (or should I say David's gun?) and now we have to worry about one more lunatic after Chloe...and maybe me...''

''Chloe really flipped out when she saw that Frank was wearing one of Rachel Amber's bracelets. That means we definitely have another suspect...''

''This is so not how I intended to spend my time back in Arcadia Bay.''</blockquote></tabber>

[[File:Max_Diary_(31).png|thumb]]

<blockquote>''After all that dramarama volume xxxiii, Chloe and I ended up taking a walk along the tracks deep in the woods. We both needed to hear nothing but the sounds of nature and wildlife... I was shaking inside from our encounter with Frank and though Chloe fronts tough, I could tell she was shaken too.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''She told me everything about Frank-which explains why she was trying to blackmail Nathan. It shocks me that the girl I grew up with watching "SpongeBob" ended up in such a scary orbit. Still, I felt safer with her at my side and I was glad we had a moment of peace.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''So it probably wasn't the best idea to lay down on the tracks and wax about life, etc.-as Chloe's leg got caught in the rail just as the goddamn train showed up. Of course I was off trying to take a photo for my portfolio... and then I had another quick flash of my tornado vision.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''I could see it, almost feel it, tearing the sky apart... My head felt like it was exploding, like in that 80's film "Scanners." Just as fast as the vision came in, it disappeared. I may be in denial about what this apocalyptic image means... or doesn't...''</blockquote>

[[File:Max_Diary_(32).png|thumb]]

<blockquote>''Then I heard Chloe SCREAMING for help. And I was shittin' kittens.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Her foot was stuck in the damn rail and naturally the train was comin' round the mountain.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''I was pretty proud of myself for coming up with a drastic (if not destructive) solution to saving Chloe-ONCE AGAIN-but just in case this journal ever falls into the wrong hands, it's going to remain our BFF secret. So there.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Our morning adventure over, Chloe dropped me off back at my campus. She was so sweet and said that this had been the best week of her life... despite everything.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''That made me feel so AWESOME! Chloe really sees us like we're taking over the world... but what if I hadn't had been able to use my rewind power to get her off of the tracks? Chloe might have to lower her expectations... and so will I.''</blockquote>

[[File:Max_Diary_(33).png|thumb|(Determinant)]]

<tabber>Didn't Take the Blame=<h5 style="display:none">Didn't Take the Blame</h5>
<blockquote>''Speaking of expectations, David talked to me without being a total prick. I wanted to tear him a new one for hitting Chloe (thinking I could rewind if things got out of control) and he didn't seem sufficiently sorry to me. I know Chloe provokes him, but that's no fucking excuse to hit someone, especially a family member. I see that David is sorry and trying to reach out to me. I know he saw terrible things in combat. I just can't trust him and his paranoid surveillance fetish, especially with how weird he acts with Kate - like she's a criminal. I'll give David props for trying to smoke the peace pipe with me, but he acts like he's still at war.''</blockquote>
|-|Took the Blame=<h5 style="display:none">Took the Blame</h5><blockquote>''Speaking of expectations, David Madsen stopped to talk to me without being a total prick. I thought he was going to bust me for taking the heat for Chloe's weed, but we just talked a little...and for the first time, I felt kind of sorry for David. He is a veteran...I know he probably saw awful things in combat. He said he doesn't want to fight with Chloe or me. But all the shit he's pulled and treating Kate like she's a suspect...just makes it hard to get along. But I promise to try. For world peace.''</blockquote>
</tabber>

<blockquote>''Something odd happened - as if EVERYTHING happening isn't bizarro - but I saw Kate having an intense conversation with Mr. Jefferson and she ended up practically running away from him in tears. I wish I could have casually asked, "Oh by the way, what's up with Kate?" (Like he would tell me anyway.) I know Kate treats Jefferson like he's an apostle or something... So what did he say to make her so upset?''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Just when I was feeling good about Chloe and me, I walk into Jefferson's class and see Nathan and Victoria actually sitting on my desk. Unreal... Asshole bookends.''</blockquote>

[[File:Max_Diary_(34).png|thumb|(Determinant)]]

<tabber>Saved Kate=<h5 style="display:none">Saved Kate</h5><blockquote>''Kate Marsh almost killed herself.''

''My hands are still shaking, but I have to write this down while I can. Right at the start of Jefferson's class, Kate went to the roof of the girls' dorm to jump. Every student and teacher was watching her, like it was a Blackwell rooftop concert.''

''I saw her actually jump, but I was just about able to use my rewind to get her back on the roof. I tried harder than I ever did and somehow I stopped time completely... I made it to the roof, but again my head felt like it was going to blow up... I knew that I couldn't just keep rewinding to save Kate. I had to try and talk her down on my own.''

''She was already in so much pain over the video and all the bullying, so she wasn't going to buy everything I tried to tell her. You see movies with people trying to talk somebody out of suicide, but it's very different when I'm the one doing the talking. I covered everything I could and Kate almost jumped anyway. Cliché or not, I told her how much her friends and family love her, even if they don't all show it now.''

''Lo and behold, Kate stepped back from the ledge. Alive. I almost cried in her arms.''

[[File:Max_Diary_(35).png|thumb|(Determinant)]]

''I know this isn't about me - though I have to admit it was an amazing feeling to walk arm in arm with Kate from the roof to outside the dorm. Like I said, the whole school - and police - were watching us almost completely silent. Then I heard what sounded like Logan yelling out, "Give it up for Max!" and everybody started to clap and cheer. Talk about surreal... the people who ignored me or treated me like crap suddenly crushing on me. That might be the strangest thing that's happened to me this insane week...''

''And that made me wonder if Victoria was watching and how she felt about all this. I almost wanted to find her... just to get in her smug face for enabling Kate's suicide attempt. Such cruel bullshit. Though, to be fair, Victoria wasn't the only one that was responsible... Nathan Prescott seemed to have disappeared... Which was probably a good thing.''

''And after all that I still had to talk to the police and give a statement. Felt so weird to do since I've seen it in pretty much every police procedural show. I had to lie my ass off when he questioned me about the other students, because I just don't think the police are ever going to find out what happened. Yes, this looks like a job for SUPER MAX. Right. Though of course, I do love it when Chloe calls me that, even if I don't feel that everyday heroic for helping Kate down... Maybe it's wrong for me to think I have to feel anything but grateful that Kate didn't jump...''

[[File:Max_Diary_(36).png|thumb|(Determinant)]]

''What was really odd was when all the students and faculty staff surrounded me and Kate, then started patting our backs and shoulders...like we were heroes.''

''I wasn't sure how to respond, considering Kate almost threw herself off the roof because of everybody at school. But like I said, I can't blame everybody... and I still don't really know where to point all my fingers...''

''The very best thing was that even though Kate was still in tears and confused... I definitely saw her smile once she realized how happy everybody was that she was alive. I smiled too. The police and paramedics swooped in and then Kate was covered in a blanket and gently escorted to the ambulance. They didn't thank me or look at me like I was a hero. I guess they're used to saving people without applause...''

''But if I'm super honest... it felt pretty cool. Like I got a hug from the whole school. So, maybe Blackwell Academy isn't totally bad...''</blockquote>

|-|Didn't save Kate=<h5 style="display:none">Didn't save Kate</h5><blockquote>''Kate Marsh killed herself.''

''I failed...''

''She was already in so much pain over the video and all the bullying, so she wasn't going to buy everything I tried to tell her. You see movies with people trying to talk somebody out of suicide but it's very different when I'm the one doing the talking. Because she didn't believe me... or maybe she just didn't want to.''

''I... I tried. Kate still died.''

''It was like that cliché about everything moving in slow motion, except in my case it was real time, not rewind time. I could see Kate's face right as she jumped and I'll never forget that look in her eyes... like she didn't want to, but had no choice...''

''It was a look of total defeat and despair... Then I could see her body flailing in space, like she became aware of what she was doing and got more scared...''

''Jesus. I can't believe I'm writing these words.''

''After she jumped, it was so weird that I was alone on the roof. Kate was there, then gone. I could hear the crowd screaming below and there was no way I was going to look at her body on the ground.''

''I felt so numb, I just casually turned and went back down the stairs. My head was pounding and my body was exhausted from the rewind. I felt exactly like a zombie must feel: dead inside.''

''When I stepped out of the dorm, I saw Kate splayed on the ground... She was surrounded by paramedics, while the police kept the students back...''

''I hope they all got a good look at their victim. They wanted to watch her on a viral video when she was alive and now they wanted to gawk at her in death... Not that I did anything to help her stay alive.''

''All my amazing new superpowers were worthless.''

''I'm nobody's hero.''</blockquote></tabber>

I kept seeing Kate's face as she fell... And then I told the Principal about David harassing Kate, which sent him into a rage. I should have known that David would actually accuse me of dealing weed. Yes, who wouldn't believe I carry oz's on me for the schoolkids? I couldn't believe that the Principal would take him at his word, but he sure did.''</blockquote>

My parents will be so proud and happy they sent me here. If this is how the adult world functions, maybe I don't belong. Even my so-called "power" doesn't mean shit anymore.''</blockquote>

The cynical side of me says, "Too little, way too fucking late." But I know that Kate would smile and forgive us all. Sigh. Cry.''</blockquote> </tabber>

<blockquote>''Day-um, that was too close. I was doing so well until I got outside and of course, it was Principal Wells of all people blocking the way. The one person I least wanted to see. I wasn't ninja enough for him so yeah, he busted me. But, I finally got to see that the gossip was true for a change. ''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Principal Wells was shitfaced. He didn't even try to hide it. In fact, he was lot cooler drunk than sober. I can see why he's so confused, dealing with Kate's family, and the Prescotts, and David Madsen. He still acts suspicious and gives me way too much "tude" as he would say (nobody says that seriously!), but I can see that he's under a lot of pressure. So much that he's so wasted he can't even use his keys at midnight. ''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Sure he was in my way, but he was no match for my rewind power. After all, I had to go and meet Chloe... Bad Max.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Even though I thought I was in "full ninja mode", Chloe still scared the shit out of me, which pissed me off considering what I've been going through. Sometimes she's so damn insensitive to other people's feelings.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''She wants all my attention for her and finding Rachel and she gets all butthurt if I don't have time for her. Obviously I have time in hand. But I can't stay mad at her for long and she was so damn excited about having the keys to the main building. And honestly? I was pretty amped up too.''</blockquote>

[[File:Max_Diary_(43).png|thumb]]

<blockquote>''Even more so when we went to the front of the building and spied on Victoria talking smack about me (shocked!) and worse, actually trying to blackmail Mr. Jefferson to pick her photo for the "Everyday Heroes" contest. She is freaking unreal...''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''I give Mr. Jefferson major respect for telling her to get lost, even though she deserved to be expelled for pulling that crap. This is her priority after what happened with Kate? I just don't understand Victoria, no matter how I try. She's already rich, pretty, and a good photographer. Why try so hard and hurt so many to manipulate everything already in your favor?''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''I just hope that's not what I'm doing with my rewind power...''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Yes, there's something incredibly AWESOME about breaking into your own school at the witching hour. Although Chloe was technically right: how can we break in with a key? Never mind that it was a stolen key from the school's head of security...''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Anyway. The Blackwell Ninjas strike again!''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''So cool to stalk the halls when it's dark and quiet. Even with so many terrible things happening all around us, it felt like Chloe and I were walking towards the center of a great cosmic mystery, something bigger than any of us...''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''But we kinda suck as master spies since we didn't have a key for the Principal's office. No worries with my rewind power at hand. And of course Doctor Warren Graham. He came through with a bitchin' mini-bomb made of sodium whatthefuckever. I probably learned more putting those ingredients together than the entire semester so far. Sorry, Ms. Grant, Warren is the star student here. He tries so hard to help... maybe too much, but what's wrong with that these days? I'm so grateful he's on my team.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Talk about being in the sancto sanctorum (thanks Latin class I barely passed!) of Blackwell... I did feel freaking weird about being in the Principal's office after midnight, going through his files and laptop with Chloe. She was waaaay too into it. Technically, we could be arrested and thrown in jail. Yikes. I just pretended that we were on a very special episode of "The Wizards of Waverly Place,"''<ref>-</ref>'' you know, just a couple of "wacky Sherlocks" investigating the school for a good cause... Yeah, that helped.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''While we didn't find The Proof, we found Nathan's file had a weird drawing in it that just said, "Rachel in the dark room" over and over. So that's a major clue that Nathan is involved in this somehow. Or he's just insane. But his note also referenced "David M." which means that we absolutely have to find a way into David's secret bunker files. For a good cause.''</blockquote>

I stopped her, but it kind of bothers me that Chloe can be so selfish like that. I'm not going to let anything happen to her, but I can't just let her do anything she wants... "Mad Max"?

<blockquote>''Despite all the "usual" breaking in and blowing up office hijinks, Chloe decided what we needed more than anything was to take a night swim in the Otter's lair.

I don't know why we were so careless after being so careful...''</blockquote>

Just two friends goofing around in the pool. I fear those youthful shenanigans might soon be a thing of our past... God, I'm starting to sound like one of the teachers at Blackwell...''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Chloe and I had a nice chat about our lives since I left... We talked about dumb boys and girls and why they're trouble... especially for me. I feel like a groupie when I talk to Chloe about our life experience... she has me so beat. I take pictures, she takes action.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Speaking of action, we had to seriously bounce when security showed up. Duh. How quiet could we be in the swimming pool? Plus after leaving a trail of our Blackwell handiwork...''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''It was so intense and exciting to get past the security guards. They had serious spotlight power so it wasn't exactly easy to stealth our way past, especially as we had to bail in Chloe's junker... but like I said, intense and exciting. Hella like Chloe Price.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Even though my body smelled like I had been doused in chlorine, it was so nice to crashin Chloe's room for the first time in five years and wake up next to her like our old sleepovers... For some reason, it reminded me of the time we were going to TP one of the neighbor's houses and we even snuck out but got chicken and ran back home, laughing all the way...''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''I remember waking up the next day and Joyce was making one of her delish breakfast downstairs and Chloe smiled at me like we were in the most secret club in the world (or at least Arcadia Bay) we were pirates, damn it! After our academic espionage last night, I felt the same way... it's just that now the stakes are much higher and much more dangerous.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''I even ended up in some of Rachel Amber's clothes since mine were trashed. A band tee and ripped jeans. So not me.

[[File:Max_Diary_(48).png|thumb]]

<blockquote>''When I went down to breakfast, Joyce actually called me "Rachel" which just seems so wrong considering how beautiful she is and how boring I am. I guess my new outfit really is working its magic. I ended up helping Joyce make breakfast just like when I was a kid on a sleepover. It's odd how quickly you can fall back into an old routine.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''So I must have set off Joyce's "nostalgia mode" since she busted out ye olde<ref>That's pirate english. If you're interested in it, here you find a translater: http://www.talklikeapirate.com</ref> photo album. I'm one of the few people who loves checking out old pictures. What was that {{Wiki|Alfred Hitchcock}} line about film being "pieces of time"? Like Mr. Jefferson said, so are photographs.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''I do think she wanted me to see her new husband in a better light. When David was happy or laughing with Joyce in a picture, I wanted to say, "And who is that?" Plus, I'm sure it's no accident that there was a photo of Rachel wearing the exact same clothes I had on. She truly is stunning. And somehow looked more punk rock than Chloe.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''The truly heartbreaking image was the last photo William Price ever took: Chloe and I making pancakes in the kitchen. Joyce really misses that joyful optimistic girl... I know she's still there... when Chloe smiled at me this morning, I saw her. The picture seemed to sum up everything we had as children and lost as adults... whatever being an "adult" means.''</blockquote>

[[File:Max_Diary_(49).png|thumb|(Determinant)]]

<blockquote>''Which was a perfect cue for Chloe to bounce into the room and start shit with Joyce. This gave me cruel cover so I could sneak into the garage and finally unlock David Madsen's X-treme Files...''<ref>This is a reference to the series ''X-Files''.</ref></blockquote>

<blockquote>''So today I finally found out what was in David's secret files... and I admit, I expected it to be worse. I'm relieved that it wasn't, so maybe I'm going easier on him than I should. No surprise that he had detailed files on Kate AND Rachel listing their whereabouts along with surveillance pics. David isn't off my shit-list yet, but he's a damn good investigator, I'll give him that. It's clear that Frank and Rachel had some kind of relationship... and I don't think Chloe is going to be very happy to hear that. She needs to start waking up. We all do.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''When David came home, things escalated quickly. He looked more upset than usual, but shrugged when he saw me wearing Rachel's clothes. He was so on edge... Maybe I'll never get to see the David that Joyce loves so much. She and Chloe really let him have it, though. This was the first time I saw them bond since we were kids...''</blockquote>

I've been wanting to rip into David like that myself for a long time. I figured worst case scenario, hello rewind power! But I wanted Joyce to know the depth of his weird paranoia.

The mystery story side of me appreciates that and hopes we can use his research to buffer our own...''</blockquote></tabber>

[[File:Max_Diary_(50).png|thumb]]

<blockquote>''Despite David's evidence and the bracelet, Chloe refused to believe Rachel was involved with Frank. This is a part of Chloe I don't much like: she gets so damn petulant if she doesn't get her way. Or if she hears something she doesn't like. Serious denial. I get why, but that doesn't make dealing with it any easier. So I threw my hands up and suggested we check out Frank's RV.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''I knew that would piss Chloe off and she would do anything to find out what kind of relationship he had with Rachel.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''But first we had to get the damn keys to the RV. Which meant going into the Two Whales Diner and bouncing like a rewind pinball between Frank, Nathan Prescott, and Officer Berry—and fucking with all of them.

<blockquote>''Chloe was so upset when we discovered that Rachel had actually been involved with Frank Bowers and she just blew up. I can never talk to her when she's like this and I just get so tired of having to walk on eggshells around her emotions. She still blames William for her messed up life, no matter how much she knows she's being unfair. I can't say that I wouldn't be just as messed up. Not that I'm not in my own way.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''In my room, all I could think was "I wish I could go back in time and help Chloe", and suddenly I was looking at the photograph William had taken of us on the day he died... and it started pulsing like it was 3D, like I could see INSIDE the photograph.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Right before he left to pick up Joyce for the last time. Since my powers somehow morphed to this new level of rewind, I decided that there was no way I was going to let William die again. So I played "hide the keys" until he had no other option but to take the bus.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''I was so happy I actually saved William. I never thought about what could go wrong...''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''I knew I was screwed when I came out of my epic rewind and saw Victoria Chase... but now she was my FRIEND. And I was a MEMBER of the Vortex Club. 'Nuff said.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''I knew I had screwed up. And then I felt sick thinking about what might have changed with Chloe... I had a clue when I saw David Madsen driving the school bus. He sure didn’t look so threatening anymore... I didn’t want to know how he ended up as a bus driver instead of with Joyce...''</blockquote>

The thing is, she was still Chloe. Just minus all the rage. This Chloe was just grateful to be alive and have her family watching over her.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Chloe begged me to spend the night and, of course, I did. I noticed how run-down parts of their home were, compared to before. I saw the incredible expensive equipment that Chloe now requires, including her new garage room. Sorry, David.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Even though I felt awful and disconnected, Chloe was just so bubbly and excited to hang out with me again, especially since I flaked on her pretty hardcore after her accident. Even in an alternate universe, I’m a shitty friend.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Chloe's world was so new and unique to me, especially her strength and kindness... and pain. She needed a whole pharmacy to get through the day. I didn't feel sorry for her—I felt in awe with her attitude. This Chloe didn't blame anybody for her condition, even though she had the right. We strolled down the beach and saw the beached whales that proved something bad was happening in both realities...''</blockquote>

[[File:Max_Diary_(55).png|thumb|(Determinant)]]

<blockquote>''And then Chloe asked me to put her to sleep.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''The accident left her body pretty much broken. Her lungs stopped working properly and she was basically dying a slow, painful death. She also felt so guilty about her parents' sacrifice and dwindling income. She wasn't erratic or tortured about this request, just... practical. Which made me feel even more terrible for putting her in this situation.''</blockquote>

<tabber>Accepted Chloe's Wish=<h5 style="display:none">Accepted Chloe's Wish</h5><blockquote>''I agreed to help her, simply because she explained that she wanted to have a choice for the last time in her life... How could I argue with that? Especially since I knew I screwed up the entire universe by making a "simple" decision. And I knew I would have to go back eventually and accept the timeline that actually happened... So Chloe and I had one last movie night watching "Blade Runner", falling asleep to the sounds of Vangelis, and when I woke up, I put my best friend to sleep... forever.''</blockquote>
|-|Refused Chloe's Wish=<h5 style="display:none">Refused Chloe's Wish</h5><blockquote>''But there was no way I was going to help my best friend take her own life. I couldn't do it, especially after what happened with Kate. I know I should have done whatever Chloe asked of me, considering I was responsible for her situation. But how could I inject her full of morphine and just watch her fade away? I know she was upset, but I just had to tell myself that this reality wasn't... real.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''After my visit to Chloe's new world, I knew it was time to go Max To The Future.<ref>Reference to the film ''Back to the Future''.</ref> I had seen the result of my temporal tampering and I got scared thinking my new power wouldn't even work anymore. That would've been Cruel Karma. Fortunately, I was able to project myself into the photograph once again and I undid everything I had done...''</blockquote>

And it's so much easier to grab David's X-files when he's not there!''</blockquote>

<tabber>Kate Survived=<h5 style="display:none">Kate Survived</h5><blockquote>''But first things first. I really had to go and see Kate. I've never visited anybody in the hospital before, much less anybody who's tried to commit suicide, so I was happy Chloe wanted to come along for support. The antiseptic smell and the endless white halls always kind of weird me out. Or maybe I'm just projecting my own fear of mortality.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''When I saw Kate in her room (surrounded by cards, flowers, and balloons), all I could think of was when I saw her the last time... on the roof. Her face was so sad and sincere and helpless then... but now she had more life in her than I'd seen in a long time.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''I had no idea what to say to somebody in a situation like this ("How are you, after you almost jumped off a roof?"), but Kate's gentle spirit made it easy. I was overjoyed to see she was drawing again and making plans for the future. Including plans to get justice for what Nathan Prescott had done to her.<br />Or what I call REVENGE.''</blockquote>
</tabber>

<blockquote>''So after getting the inside info and assist from the other members of our team, Chloe and I made our way to the boys' dorm a.k.a. "Nathan's Lair." Chloe stood guard out in the hall and I stealthed my way into Nathan's room.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''And even though I've become a master spy and detective, I still get surprised by things I see or find... like Nathan's sleek, expressionist bro cave. It was like walking from light to shadow in a single step. I swear, I could feel the temperature drop the second I walked in. But then, Nathan knows photography and he knows you have to keep the film and equipment chilled (I store my instant film hoard in Mr. Jefferson's classroom).''</blockquote>

[[File:Max_Diary_(58).png|thumb|(Determinant)]]

<blockquote>''Speaking of cold stuff, Nathan's room was layered in creepy shit. The disturbing but impressive photos, all the evidence from his father's bullying, and probably the most important clue we could ever find: Nathan's phone, likely loaded with messages and mysteries. It's not a good thing that I've internalized spying and stealing so casually over the past week...''
''Everyday Hero, amirite?''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''And that's when Nathan Prescott showed up. He looked so wild-eyed and out of control that I felt a twinge of sympathy that he clearly needed help. But then I remembered he was also an asshole and had been extremely dangerous to me, Chloe and Kate. So before I had to rewind, Warren entered the scene and my White Knight HEADBUTTED Nathan in perfect payback. I couldn't believe it. Neither could Nathan.''</blockquote>

So our mission to bring Frank onboard ended in his death.''</blockquote>

I saw him for the first time as he is: a creepy, manipulative psychopath, filled with bullshit. He uses art and passion to seduce people, but behind that there's nothing but hate and perversion. I only pray that I can fix this timeline, not fuck it up.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Max to the future. It feels like I finally made things right. Chloe is alive. David Madsen became a real everyday hero by busting Jefferson and his dark room, along with Nathan and his father. The Prescotts have lost control of Arcadia Bay. Now I'm the official "Everyday Hero" on my way to San Francisco with Principal Wells, who is a lot more funny and laidback when he's not stressing about Blackwell Academy. It's hard for me to totally relax but all these pieces of time seem to be falling in place.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''The Zeitgeist Gallery was a trip. Why does somebody so shy like me want to be famous for her photographs? I don't care about people kissing my ass, I just want to hang out with great artists and learn from them. It was so sweet that my work was displayed in a respected gallery and I got to experience that public response. But I'm not a fan of the spotlight. That Berkeley reporter made me feel like I wouldn't even know what to say. "Oh yes, this selfie represents my soul." I'd tear up my own pictures if I ever talked like that.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''But it was so nice just to have a safe, peaceful moment for myself, where my dreams came true instead of my nightmares. I had a real vision of my future and who I wanted to be. So I won't feel bad about rewinding time once again to destroy my contest photo.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''The storm is still coming to Arcadia Bay, which means Chloe's life is still in danger. No prize or exhibition is worth losing her again. At least I can use my picture for a truly important reason and yet again try to fix the machineries of time that I keep breaking...''</blockquote>

[[File:Max_Diary_(69).png|thumb|(Determinant)]]

<blockquote>''So I did it. Back in my room again, erasing another timeline... or does that reality go on without me? Am I just creating knots in time? My biggest fear is that I won't be able to rewind when I most need to... or even remember what I've done.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''And my head does feel like it's going to burst if I keep on doing this. My nosebleeds are a bad omen. Yet I'm here — I can rip up my contest photo and still warn David about Jefferson. It just means I won't be going to San Francisco. Yet. And I have to protect Chloe from one storm.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''I knew things were going too easy. And I messed it all up. As usual.<br />Jefferson was pissed that I had torn up my contest photo, freaking out about my "wasted talent." Bastard torched my diary, so I couldn't even rewind using my art class selfie.<br />So my whole plan took a shit and I couldn't text David about Jefferson...<br />which is how I ended up back in this evil Dark Room, after I thought I had escaped.''</blockquote>

<tabber>Warned Victoria Successfully=<h5 style="display:none">Warned Victoria Successfully</h5>
<blockquote>''The worst thing was seeing that Victoria was gone and knowing that Jefferson had already killed her... all because of me. I've never felt so helpless and hopeless in my life. It made me even more determined to rewind time and save Victoria as well...''</blockquote></tabber>

<blockquote>''Amazingly, it was David Madsen who turned up to save me. Thanks to his own surveillance, he was almost Jefferson's shadow and tracked him down to the farmhouse.<br />I was able to use my rewind for good and actually help David battle Jefferson.<br />I do know that the only way I can save Chloe now is to get that picture that Warren took of us in the parking lot. I just hope he's okay in this storm.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''For the first time since my visions, I was able to see the storm manifest in this reality. When I felt the sharp wind from the tornado, everything became more desperate. I was so relieved to get ahold of Warren, but he's definitely trapped in the Two Whales diner with the photo. Yes, this looks like a job for Super Max.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''I borrowed Jefferson's car to haul ass and found that Nathan left me a sad voicemail. He only wanted to warn me, to not be blamed for Rachel. But Jefferson wouldn't forgive him....''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Apocalypse Arcadia Bay.<br />I never felt the raw force of nature, but this storm is ground zero. My town is being destroyed and I'm so furious that I didn't pay more attention to my visions. I could have warned and saved so many people... instead of watching them die around me.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''I decided I needed to fulfill my destiny, whatever that was, and use my powers for good and more importantly, to not be afraid. There was no more time for fear.<br />So I barely made it to town and helped as much as I could, until I had to rewind to stop a raging fire from blowing up the diner. At least I was able to do something.''</blockquote>

</tabber>

<blockquote>''The main thing was that I had Warren's photo and I would get one last chance to save Chloe. I felt queasy considering what a mess I've made, but there was no going back anymore.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Warren rules. I was able to rewind to the End Of The World party with his photo and I felt like I was getting more confident with my time travel skills. It's always hard to deal with Chloe when only I have the benefit of knowing her future. But the one thing Chloe appreciates the most is honesty so I told her everything, from when she was paralyzed to the Dark Room to San Francisco. She didn't want to believe that David was so heroic, but she knows I wouldn't lie. And I could tell Chloe felt awful for what Jefferson did to me.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''Chloe is back!<br />I didn't even care that this was the real end of the world... It just felt so good to hold her again after everything we'd been through.

== Inconsistencies ==
{{Main|Inconsistencies (Life is Strange)}}

* On the [[Max's Character Notes#Warren|character note]] for Warren in Max's diary, she mentions that he is "her age," but this contradicts his age on his student record, since they are aged two years apart. It is possible that Max didn't know Warren's age at the time she wrote that in her diary, since she had only recently arrived at Blackwell.
* Despite the fact that Max mentions Nathan is '''19''' in her [[Max's Character Notes#Nathan|character note]] about him, his school file states that he was born on August 29, 1995, making him '''18''' years old. This could be explained by Max being misinformed, as she did not know Nathan well and was perhaps unlikely to know his birthday.
* Max's [[Max's Character Notes#Kate|character notes for Kate Marsh]] will change in this episode, depending on whether Max manages to save her life or not. A new decal will appear on the page to cover the 'LiFE' graphic that was visible in the previous two episodes. However, there is currently an inconsistency with how these new graphics appear, due to the files being misnamed in the Unreal Engine packages.<ref group="note">(''TX_Character_E3_Kate_SF, TX_Character_E4_Kate_SF, and TX_Character_E5_Kate_SF''). The sticker graphic that implies Kate is alive has been labelled ''Kate_scrapbook_dead'', and the sticker graphic that implies that Kate is dead has been labelled ''Kate_scrapbook_alive''.</ref> If Kate dies, the sticker graphic that appears after this consequence implies she is still alive ("''Get Well Soon''"). If Kate lives, the sticker graphic that appears implies that she has died ("''Love is how you stay alive, even after you are gone''").<ref group="note">DONTNOD were made aware of this inconsistency on 29th March 2017. It is unknown if a patch will be released that fixes this issue.</ref>
* A drawing on page 11 of Max's diary shows Max executing her [[rewind]] gesture with her left hand raised, but she raises her right hand in the game. This sketch is inconsistent with gameplay but appears to have been based on early concept art that features as the box art for the game.
* Max has drawn Chloe with a red hoop earring on page 17 of her diary even though Chloe has no earring in the game. On the next page, Max does refer to Chloe having piercings (plural), but there are no visible ones at this early point in the game. (We later see in Episode 3 that Chloe has a belly button piercing but still no ear piercings or earrings in general.) Even though Max's sketch could be put down to an idealized version of Chloe from Max's imagination, the sketch is a replication of early concept art. As for the journal entry about piercings, this could have been an early writing remnant that the concept art was based on, or vice versa.
* On Page 22 of Max's diary, she writes about Chloe: "It's so strange where our lives have gone since the last time we hung out when we were '''thirteen'''." With their birth dates (Chloe - March 1994; Max - September 1995), there is no way that they would have been aged 13 at the same time. Chloe would have turned '''14''' six months before Max turned 13. A possible explanation for this could be that Max is simply generalizing their ages, using the age that she remembers herself being. Another example of when she does this is in Episode 4 when she sees the pirate CD in Chloe's room: ''"Oh my God, I made that mix for her when we were twelve."''
*On page 39 of Max's diary for October 9, 2013, an extract of a personal organizer for March 2014 can be seen (although the month and year is partially obscured and not something that is immediately obvious). A plausible explanation could simply be that Max had a calendar for the full 2013-2014 academic school year.

== Trivia ==
*Max's Diary contains a lot of foreshadowing messages, symbols, drawings and stickers, some funny, some mysterious, some cryptic, and some with obscure references. Some of Max's writings are also quite premonitory, ominous, curious, and downright bizarre.
*Max, in a passage from her diary seems to predict the end decision, way before it's hinted to the players, (Episode 4); " ''I remember this famous episode of the original {{wiki|Star Trek}}, where Kirk has to go back in time and let the person he loves die, so the Nazis won't win the war...''<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference">[https://life-is-strange.fandom.com/wiki/Max%27s_Diary#cite_note-14 [13]]</sup> What kind of fucked up choice is that?".
*The doe is a recurrent theme in Max's diary, it appears several times in drawings, stickers and in symbolic ways, including in the last page of said diary.
*Max's Diary serves as an insight into Max's mind, revealing her feelings in detail, motivations, doubts, fears and even reasons behind some of her decisions.
* On page 22 there is a sticker that reads, "Three Meters Above The Sky", which appears to be a reference to the 2004 Italian film inspired by the novel ''Tre metri sopra il cielo'' by Federico Moccia (literally "Three meters above the sky"). {{Wiki|Three Steps Over Heaven}}, (the English title for the film), is summarized as "A romantic drama for teenagers that tells the story of two youngsters belonging to opposite worlds. It's the chronicle of an improbable relationship that is practically impossible but just as inevitable. It will end up dragging the couple along for a voyage of discovery on which they will experience true love together for the first time. She is a well-to-do girl. He is a rebellious boy, addicted to risk and danger" During the film the boy becomes more tender, softer, the girl becomes harder, more rebellious." The descriptions of these two characters appear to match the characters of Max and Chloe rather well.
*The phrase in page 32 of Max's diary; "And I was shittin' kittens", may be a reference to {{wiki|Lethal Weapon 4}}. Martin Riggs, the character played by Mel Gibson says the following; "That general's gonna be shittin' kittens when he sees the money is counterfeit."
*The "Et in Arcadia ego" sticker from Max's journal may be a reference to the painting {{wiki|Et in Arcadia ego}}, a work by Nicolas Poussin a leading painter of the French Baroque style.
*The sticker "Not all those who wander are lost" is reference to a phrase from a poem by J. R. R. Tolkien, "{{wiki|All that is gold does not glitter}}, that appears in his most famous work {{wiki|The Lord of the Rings}}. 
*The "My hair is being pulled by the stars again" sticker may be a reference to a quote by {{wiki|Anaïs Nin}}.
*The "With great powers comes great bullshit sticker" is a reference to the quote from the Spider-Man comics; "{{wiki|With great power comes great responsibility}}."

== Patches == 
* Prior to the release of Episode 2, the character notes for [[Max's Character Notes#Victoria|Victoria]] and [[Max's Character Notes#Jefferson|Mr. Jefferson]] as well as page 9 of the main diary referred to the "Everyday Heroes" contest as "Everyday Hero" contest. 
* Prior to the release of Episode 5 (before 1.0.0.371598), page 1 of Max's diary had read: "But who cares because I GOT INTO BLACKWELL ACADEMY, a unique and famous private school for seniors! NO KIDS ALLOWED!" It now only reads: "But who cares because I GOT INTO BLACKWELL ACADEMY!"
