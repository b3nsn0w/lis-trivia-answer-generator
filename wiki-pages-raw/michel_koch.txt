* Michel Koch revealed in an interview that they wrote [[Episode 1: Chrysalis]], with the intention of introducing the typical high school stereotypes, before building upon them with every episode. "When we started to create every character, not only Warren, we really wanted to use known archetypes that people see in teenage drama and in movies."<ref name=":0">[https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/exqpga/first-love-and-awkwardness-inside-the-mind-of-life-is-strange-co-director-michel-koch-423 Interview with VICE.]</ref>

Everyone has shades of grey, bits of darkness."<ref name=":0">[https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/exqpga/first-love-and-awkwardness-inside-the-mind-of-life-is-strange-co-director-michel-koch-423 Interview with VICE.]</ref>
