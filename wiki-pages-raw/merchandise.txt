''TBC - Needs to be updated with Hot Topic, Fangamer and Sanshee merchandise.''

On March 8, 2019, the official ''Life is Strange'' social media accounts [http://lifeisstrange-blog.tumblr.com/post/183316330950/forbidden-planet-pre-orders-are-now-live-for-new released news] that a range of merchandise would be released by Forbidden Planet on April 15, 2019. On the promotional image for the merchandise, there were three items that did not appear to be part of the range available for pre-ordering at the time. Two of these items feature the sugar skull design by [[Don't Nod|DONTNOD]] artist [[Fred Augis]], and the third is the "Hello World" design on a travel pass holder.

Later a new range of merchandise was added (further information needs to be researched). On December, an exclusive set of 53 fully illustrated playing cards featuring character concept art from all games in the franchise, which would be available starting from January 3, 2020. 

On May 8, 2019, a new merchandise collection was launched by Hot Topic, coinciding with the release of Episode 3 of ''Life is Strange 2''. The collection was "geared for every fan of the Life is Strange franchise" and includes t-shirts, blankets, jewellery, hosiery, drinkware and novelties based on the games ''Life is Strange'', ''Before the Storm'' and the recently released ''Life is Strange 2'' (Episodes 1-3). To celebrate the launch of the collection, Hot Topic's Twitter followers were able to enter for the chance to win a free ''Life is Strange'' digital comic book from Titan Comics.<ref>[https://www.licensing.biz/life-is-strange-lands-timeless-merch-line-with-hot-topic/ Life is Strange lands timeless merch line with Hot Topic] (May 8, 2019)</ref>

"LIFE IS STRANGE VIDEO GAME MERCHANDISE

Life is strange—especially in Arcadia Bay, Oregon. But, you knew that already, especially if you've played through Life is Strange and lived through all the time-rewinding to tell the tale.

Even if you can't really rewind time when you're not playing the game, who's to say you can't look like you know how to? Hot Topic's line of Life is Strange merch will have you feeling just like Maxine Caulfield as quick as the flash of a camera with tons of niche shirts that don't just look great but also rep your favorite game.

Want to cheer the Arcadia Bigfoots on to victory? There's a T-shirt for that. Boldly looking to rep that skulking raven that lurks around in Chloe's dreams? There's a T-shirt for that, too. Or, if you simply want to pass along the wise, iconic words of Hawt Dawg Man, toss on a Life is Strange Work Hard, Mustard Big T-shirt—you know that Chloe and Max would appreciate this quirky little homage to their alternate timeline adventure (plus, wearing a niche T like that helps you weed out the true fans like you).

Hot Topic has everything you need to rep your favorite Indie video game—in full force with a rainbow Life is Strange Arcadia Bay Pride Girls T-Shirt or ever-so-subtly with a Life is Strange Chloe Raven Girls T-shirt."
