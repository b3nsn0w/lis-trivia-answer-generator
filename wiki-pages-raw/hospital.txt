The '''Hospital''' is located in [[Arcadia Bay]] and, depending on [[Maxine Caulfield|Max Caulfield]]'s [[Choices and Consequences|choices]], can first be seen in "[[Episode 2: Out of Time|Out of Time]]." There is another determinant chance to visit the hospital again in "[[Episode 4: Dark Room|Dark Room]]."

== Episode Two - "[[Episode 2: Out of Time|Out of Time]]" ==
If Max manages to stop [[Kate Marsh]] from committing suicide, the hospital can first be seen in this episode's ending cutscene where Kate is seen lying in a bed with several balloons tied to it.

== Episode Four - "[[Episode 4: Dark Room|Dark Room]]" ==
If Max managed to save Kate in "Out of Time," she visits the hospital and talks to Kate in this episode.

== Trivia ==
{{Main|Hospital Ending}}
*There was an [[Hospital Ending|alternate ending]] planned in the early stages of development in which [[Chloe Price]] would have ended up in a coma. As evident from a [[Media:Hospital Room Concept Art by Gary Jamroz-Palma.jpg|piece of concept art]], Max would have visited Chloe at the hospital.
*The hospital location was originally designed for the above-mentioned alternate ending, and the scene with Kate after she survived her suicide attempt was only added later on because the fans liked Kate so much.
*It is unknown what the outside of the hospital looks like.
