##  Lyrics 
:Crazy Suzie followed me, all the way home
:She said “Don’t you want to be alone?”
:I never quite understood, what she was aiming at,
:I was always better of alone.
:She said; “You can still be lonely, when you sleep next to someone.”

:I made my way to the drug store, on the corner of my street.
:I was looking for a place to eat.
:I saw an old man at the bus stop he just looked at me and smiled.
:With wisdom in his eyes.
:Like he’d seen me here before and he knew, all my alibis’.

:Ohh, he leaned across, and into my ear he said;
:Ohh, “When everything you do is just a means to an end, who will you count on then?”

:Late that night I bumped into, a girl I used to know.
:One that really moved me so.
:I thought; “Could it be that you and me, could’ve been something more?”
:I always wanted something more.
:We danced around the truth a while, then she let me go home alone.

:Ohh, she leaned on me, and into my ear she said;
:Ohh, “When everything you do is just a means to an end, who will you count on then?”

:And when I think about it, don’t wanna talk about it.
:And when I think about it, don’t wanna talk about it.
:Ohh, she leaned on me, and into my ear she said;
:Ohh, “When everything you do is just a means to an end, who will you count on then?”

:Ohh, “When everything you do is just a means to an end, who will you count on then?”

:It’s just a means to an end, who will you count on then?
