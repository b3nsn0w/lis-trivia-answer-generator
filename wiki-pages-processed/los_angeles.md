The city of **Los Angeles** is a recurring theme throughout *[Life is Strange](life_is_strange.md)*.

##  Background 
*[Chloe Price](chloe_price.md) dreamed of going there with [Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md) before Rachel's disappearance in early 2013. Chloe borrowed a lot of money ("Three grand plus interest") from [Frank Bowers](frank_bowers.md) in order to make this journey.
*Unbeknownst to Chloe, Rachel would have left [Arcadia Bay](arcadia_bay.md) with Frank (possibly to Los Angeles).
*Rachel once asked a [Truck Driver](truck_driver.md) if he could drive her to Los Angeles.
*[Mark Jefferson](mark_jefferson.md) tells Max that "Los Angeles would have killed [Rachel] anyway."
*Before the [Storm](storm.md) blew[Frank's RV](_his_rv.md) into the side of the [Two Whales Diner](two_whales_diner.md), Frank was about to make the drive to Los Angeles to try and find Rachel.

##  Trivia 
[File:Welcome_to_HELL-a-Poster.png](right.md)
* A "Welcome to L.A." poster can be found on the wall of the hideout. It seems to have a triple pun as a result of the graffiti:
**Welcome to HELL.
**Welcome to HELLA.
**Welcome to HELL A.
