**Harry Aaron Prescott** is a member of the [Prescott Family](prescott_family.md). He is presumably deceased, and the father, or grandfather, of [Sean Prescott](sean_prescott.md), [Nathan Prescott](nathan.md)'s father.

##  Background 
The Prescott family seem to have strong roots in [Arcadia Bay](arcadia_bay.md), donating to create a new library in the town. They also seem to have lent money to people, and owned much property around the area; not unlike the 2013 Prescotts.

##  Episode Four - [Episode 4: Dark Room](_dark_room_.md) 
The old [barn](barn.md) in [Episode 4: Dark Room](episode_4__dark_room.md) is registered as being owned under his name. The barn is featured in the episode as the location for the Prescott Bunker (also known as the [Dark Room (Location)](dark_room.md)), in which devious acts were committed against female victims.
