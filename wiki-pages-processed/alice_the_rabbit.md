She is seen staying in [Kate's Room](her_room.md) at [Blackwell Academy](blackwell_academy.md) during [Episode 2: Out of Time](episode_2.md) when Max is returning a book to Kate. In [Episode 3: Chaos Theory](episode_3.md), Alice, her cage, and her carrot supply are moved to [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md)'s room in order for her to take care of Alice while Kate is in the hospital/after Kate's suicide.

##  Episode Three - "[Episode 3: Chaos Theory](chaos_theory.md)" 
Following Kate's suicide (attempt), Alice will be moved to [Max's Room](max_s_room.md). Max will either tell her that Kate will be back soon or that she is her "new mommy" from now on. Max has the opportunity to feed Alice with carrots before exiting her room to meet up with [Chloe Price](chloe.md).

Provided that Max managed to save Kate from killing herself, Kate will later [Max's_Messages#Kate_3](message.md) Max about missing her and Alice. Max will reply that everyone at Blackwell, including Alice, misses her, too.
