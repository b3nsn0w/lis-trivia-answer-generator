##  Lyrics 
: Somewhere out here
: Way up high in the stratosphere
: There’s someone watching
: Over her life

: It rains when she is crying
: The sun comes out when she’s smiling
: The world weeps when she’s yearning
: But the fire keeps on burning

: With you in my arms
: I think I can make it
: With you on my side
: You know I will make it

: Someday they’ll meet again
: Like old times that never end
: Until then he’ll hold at bay
: All the bad things that come her way

: There’s a storm when she is raging
: Turns cold when she is forsaken
: You can’t stop the hurting
: But you can drop the curtain

: With you in my arms
: I think I can make it
: With you on my side
: You know I will make it

: Someday they’ll meet again
: A pot of gold at the bitter end

: It rains when she is crying
: The sun comes out when she’s smiling
: She weeps when she’s yearning
: But the world keeps on turning

: With you in my arms
: I think I can make it
: With you by my side
: You know I will make it
