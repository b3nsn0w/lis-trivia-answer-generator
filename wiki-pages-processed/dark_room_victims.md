## Notes
*When Max and Chloe open the Dark Room cupboard in the [Episode 4: Dark Room](fourth_episode.md), only 17 binders are visible. Though unpacking the [Media:Darkroom-allvictims.png](game_files.md), however, it becomes apparent that there are five additional names, which makes for a total of 23 victims (including Max).
* Victoria will be taken to the Dark Room if Max warned her about [Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md) in [Episode 4: Dark Room](episode_4__dark_room.md). After Max warned Victoria, she went to Jefferson in search of protection, which led to her drugging and subsequent capture.
*[File:Red folders.png](thumb.md) A glimpse of the red folders at the end of "[Episode 1: Chrysalis](chrysalis.md)" reveals that the folder immediately before the one marked "Rachel" is marked with the name "Kelly". When [Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md) was attending [Blackwell Academy](blackwell_academy.md), a girl called Kelly Davis was staying in room 217 which is the room directly opposite Rachel Amber's old room (224) and next door to [Dana Ward](dana_ward.md)'s room (218). These room residents are visible on the [Media:Dormmap2.png](dormitory_floor_plan.md) that appears in [Max's Nightmare](max_s_nightmare.md) in [Episode 5: Polarized](episode_5__polarized.md), when she inhabits the clothing of Rachel Amber. It has been confirmed by [DONTNOD](dontnod.md) that these two are the same Kelly.
* In the [Alternative Timeline (Life is Strange)](alternative_timeline.md), Chloe mentioned that she had a friend named Megan who supported her while Max was away, but has recently become distant. It is confirmed by the directors that this is the same Megan whose name appears on the binder.
