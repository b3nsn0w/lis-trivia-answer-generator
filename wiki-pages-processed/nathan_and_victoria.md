[File:Nathan and Victoria (square).png](right.md)
This article is meant to give a deeper and more detailed look at the relationship between [Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md) and [Victoria Chase](victoria_chase.md) and it's development throughout *[Life is Strange](life_is_strange.md)*. They are members of the [Vortex Club](vortex_club.md), in which both of them are considered the co-leaders.

##  Background 
Both Nathan and Victoria come from wealthy families. The [Prescott Family](prescott_family.md) is known to be the oldest and most influential family in [Arcadia Bay](arcadia_bay.md), in which they paid for a dormitory within [Blackwell Academy](blackwell_academy.md). Victoria's Parents own a famous gallery called "Chase Space" which is located in [Seattle](seattle.md). Perhaps because of this, they are best friends, with [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) calling them parallels of each other.
