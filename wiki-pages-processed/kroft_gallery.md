##  Episode One - "[Episode 1: Chrysalis](chrysalis.md)" 
A letter from Amanda Kroft, the owner of the gallery, to Victoria can be seen in [Victoria's Room](victoria_s_room.md). Max remarks that she at least puts her work out there, unlike her. The letter reads as follows:

{{Bigquote|Dear Ms Chase

Thank you for your submission to the Kroft 
Gallery. Unfortunately, your work is not compatible 
with our mission statement. We appreciate your
effort and wish you success in future endeavors.

Best
