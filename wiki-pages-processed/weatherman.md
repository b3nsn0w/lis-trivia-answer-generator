The **Weatherman** is the local newsman for KBAY7 News reporting about the strange [Meteorological Anomalies](weather_anomalies.md) occurring in [Arcadia Bay](arcadia_bay.md). He interviews [Dr. Hedorah](dr__hedorah.md), a meteorologist expert from [Portland](portland.md).

##  Appearances 
The Weatherman moderates a talk show together with a woman about the extreme weather, e.g. the unseasonable snow or the unscheduled eclipse. Global Warming is considered as a possible reason. Arcadia Bay residents can call in and describe their experiences.

|... but that doesn't explain the recent extreme weather patterns. No, but we have to start with the hypothesis that climate change is a partial cause for the unseasonal weather. That doesn't explain everything of course. Frankly, we don't know yet.

(DR. HEDORAHPortland Meteorologist Expert)

Dr. Hedorah, will your team know more after their latest tests?

I hope we see more patterns, which gives us an atmospheric template...

Many local residents of Arcadia Bay have been questioning what has been going on with this crazy weather. We had an eclipse yesterday, a snowstorm two days ago -- which as most of you know is not common this time of year! It's unprecedented, to be honest with you. The last time that we had a snowstorm of this caliber was over a hundred years ago. All of us are questioning, what is happening in Arcadia Bay?! Please feel free to call in and let me know what your experience has been. What you think this might be. Is this Global Warming? What is causing all of this crazy weather?
