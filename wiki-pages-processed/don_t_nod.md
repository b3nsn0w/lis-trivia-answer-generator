##  History 
Founded by former {{Wiki|Criterion Games}}, {{Wiki|Ubisoft}} and {{Wiki|Electronic Arts}} staff, DONTNOD started operating out of a small Paris-based office in May 2008. 

Their first game and AAA release was the third-person action brawler titled *Remember Me*. This game was published by {{Wiki|Capcom}} in June 2013 and is an action-adventure sci-fi game based around a member of a resistance group looking to recover her lost memories. The game was originally called *Adrift* and was planned as an exclusive title for Sony's Playstation 3 console, but it was cancelled by Sony in 2011 due to budget constraints. The team had spent almost five years developing *Remember Me*, but its critical reception was mixed and it failed to hit commercial targets. As a result, Capcom never commissioned a sequel and Dontnod found itself in trouble. In January, 2014, it was reported that the studio had filed for bankruptcy. CEO Oskar Guilbert dismissed reports that the studio was bankrupt and stated that earlier financial issues were no longer a problem for the company as they started to work on "new projects" which required judicial reorganization and new investments.[https://www.polygon.com/2014/1/31/5364452/report-remember-me-studio-dontnod-filing-for-bankruptcy Report: Remember Me studio Dontnod filing for bankruptcy] (January 31, 2014) CEO Oskar Guilbert: "After *Remember Me*, the financial situation at Dontnod was very difficult. After that, we had to restructure the company and reinvent ourselves. Before, what we wanted to do was make big games with large teams and long production cycles... So we had to change that, do something smaller with smaller teams. We didn’t want to do just a small game, we also wanted to bring something new to the market, and we did it pretty well with *Life is Strange*."[https://www.mcvuk.com/business-news/how-life-is-strange-changed-dontnod/ How Life is Strange changed Dontnod] (October 25, 2016) 

*Life is Strange* is the studio's second game and breakthrough title, published by . At the time, most prospective publishers were unwilling to publish the game unless it featured more action sequences[https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-s-life-is-strange-considered-100-diffe/1100-6425742/ Square Enix's Life is Strange Considered 100 Different Names] (March 6, 2015) or had a male protagonist due to "little sales potential"[https://www.gamespot.com/articles/other-publishers-told-us-to-make-it-a-male-lead-ch/1100-6424577/ "Other Publishers Told Us to Make It a Male Lead Character," Life is Strange Dev Says] (January 10, 2015)[https://v1.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/139401-Publishers-Disliked-Dontnods-Life-is-Strange-Having-Female-Leads Publishers Wanted Life is Strange Devs to Make Leads Male] (January 11, 2015), a problem they had already faced with their first title, *Remember Me*.[https://www.gamespot.com/articles/publishers-said-you-cant-have-a-female-character-says-remember-me-dev/1100-6405550/ Publishers said 'You can't have a female character,' says Remember Me dev] (March 19, 2013) CEO Oskar Guilbert had also challenged the idea at the start.Barnes, Ben (June 2016). "Edge #293". Edge. p. 94-97: Future plc. Square Enix, who loved the game's storytelling element, was the only publisher that supported the project with no intention to change it. Originally, Dontnod had pitched a larger game to Square Enix that the publisher was not interested in, whereupon Dontnod chose to present their smaller narrative project *What If?*[https://www.mcvuk.com/business-news/they-originally-pitched-a-different-game-how-square-enix-discovered-life-is-strange/ ‘They originally pitched a different game’: how Square Enix discovered Life Is Strange] (August 7, 2015), which would later be retitled to *Life is Strange*.The game was originally codenamed "What If" but then retitled to distinguish itself from the film of the same name. Dontnod had considered over 100 different titles, including "Chrysalis", which would later be used as the first episode's title. Before signing with Square Enix, *Life is Strange* was imagined as a full-length video game that Dontnod would self-publish. However, the publisher surmised that it would be more successful as an episodic title. The episodic format, which had become a successful phenomenon through Telltale Games' releases, was adapted due to financial reasons as a "slow risk" approach, as well as marketing and creative reasons, allowing them to tell the story in its preferred slow pace.[https://www.mcvuk.com/business-news/life-is-good-dontnod-on-the-success-of-life-is-strange-and-what-comes-next/ Life is good: Dontnod on the success of Life is Strange and what comes next] (March 15, 2015)[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/26/life-is-strange-episodic-video-game-dontnodLife Is Strange: episodic video games prove as addictive as episodic TV] (April 26, 2015) An episodic game about a young girl with rewind powers, it builds on a central mechanism from their first game, *Remember Me*, the memory remixes. Its first episode was released in January 2015; all five episodes were released by October 2015. Development on this game actually began in April 2013 with a small team of 15 people. This increased to a staff of 40 after a year when Square Enix stepped in to support production in June 2014.Citation needed.Two months after signing their publishing contract with Square Enix, *Life Is Strange* was announced for PS3, Xbox 360 and PC at Gamescom on August 11, 2014.[http://dont-nod.com/en/studio/ Donntod Entertainment: Discover Our Story] 

*Life is Strange* was the saving grace for Dontnod and improved the studio's situation immensely from two years ago. The episodic narrative-driven adventure game has won multiple awards and sold in huge numbers, thanks in part to the publishing efforts of Square Enix. Whereas prior to *Life is Strange*, Dontnot had to work hard to find a publisher, now publishers would reach out to the studio on their own for collaboration. "It has completely transformed Dontnod," according to Oskar Guilbert.

Since then, the studio has taken on various other narrative projects. Their third game, ''*, released on June 5th, 2018, published by Focus Home Interactive. *Vampyr* is a role-playing game set in 1918, London. Dr. Jonathan Reid, a pioneer in blood transfusion methods, recently returned from the front at the end of WWI and turned into a vampire. The game follows Jonathan as he investigates the  (or what looks like it) and searches for *who* turned him and *why*; all the while he struggles between his thirst for blood and his  to cure people.

On July 27, 2016, the formation of Dontnod Eleven (formerly HeSaw) as a sister studio to Dontnod was announced, and that Dontnod helped them develop the side-scrolling shooter *Battlecrew: Space Pirates''. "The goal of our collaboration is to help those talented independent developers and benefit from their know-how", CEO Oskar Guilbert said.[http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-07-28-dontnod-deepens-collaboration-with-hesaw Dontnod deepens collaboration with Hesaw] (July 28, 2016)[https://www.polygon.com/2016/8/19/12550954/dontnod-eleven-battlecrew-space-pirates-life-is-strange Dontnod Eleven isn't catering to Life is Strange fans, and that’s the point] (August 19, 2016)

Michel Koch said in an interview in July 2016 that they have two teams at Dontnod, one working on Vampyr and one working on an exciting unannounced game, which later turned out to be *[Life is Strange 2](life_is_strange_2.md)* and was revealed on May 18, 2017.

On August 22, 2017, it was revealed a new partnership with Bandai Namco for the creation of a brand-new IP on a new narrative adventure experience that has been in development since 2016. The story was said to take place in a fictional city in the US and will include a "fair dose of investigation". This new title is developed by a new team of senior devs. Hervé Hoerdt, VP of marketing and digital at Bandai Namco, said that they are aiming for triple-A quality, an emotional experience with investigation and psychologically deep characters with their partnership with Dontnod.[http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/exclusive-bandai-namco-partners-with-dontnod-on-new-narrative-adventure-ip/0186186 EXCLUSIVE: Bandai Namco partners with Life is Strange studio Dontnod on new narrative adventure IP] (August 22, 2017) On June 8, the name was revealed to be *Twin Mirror*.[https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/twin-mirror/news/help-sam-find-the-truth-and-unveil-basswood’s-secrets-upcoming-psychological Bandai Namco press release] (June 8, 2018) [https://web.archive.org/web/20180701140322/https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/twin-mirror/news/help-sam-find-the-truth-and-unveil-basswood%E2%80%99s-secrets-upcoming-psychological Archived](https___web_archive_org_web_20180701140322_https___en_bandainamcoent_eu_twin_mirror_news_help_sam_find_the_truth_and_unveil_basswood_e2_80_99s_secrets_upcoming_psychological_archived.md)

##  Trivia 
* The word "dontnod" is a palindrome, meaning it is spelled the same backwards as it is forwards.
* The laterally or vertically inverted letter "N" in DONTNOD Entertainment's oroginal company logo appears in the Cyrillic alphabet and is equivalent to the letter "I" in the English/Latin alphabet.
* On January 27, 2015, a [Reddit AMA (Life is Strange)](reddit_ama.md) for *Life is Strange* was held. 
* The [Weatherman](weatherman.md), a character in *Life is Strange*, is based on and modeled by CEO Guilbert Oskar, as confirmed on *Life is Strange*'s official Twitter.[https://twitter.com/LifeIsStrange/status/717758674417098752 Twitter post]

DONTNOD 10 YEAR ANNIVERSARY

##  Notes 

, {{Wiki|Ubisoft}} and {{Wiki|Electronic Arts}} staff, DONTNOD started operating out of a small Paris-based office in May 2008. 

Their first game and AAA release was the third-person action brawler titled *Remember Me*. This game was published by {{Wiki|Capcom}} in June 2013 and is an action-adventure sci-fi game based around a member of a resistance group looking to recover her lost memories. The game was originally called *Adrift* and was planned as an exclusive title for Sony's Playstation 3 console, but it was cancelled by Sony in 2011 due to budget constraints. The team had spent almost five years developing *Remember Me*, but its critical reception was mixed and it failed to hit commercial targets. As a result, Capcom never commissioned a sequel and Dontnod found itself in trouble. In January, 2014, it was reported that the studio had filed for bankruptcy. CEO Oskar Guilbert dismissed reports that the studio was bankrupt and stated that earlier financial issues were no longer a problem for the company as they started to work on "new projects" which required judicial reorganization and new investments.[https://www.polygon.com/2014/1/31/5364452/report-remember-me-studio-dontnod-filing-for-bankruptcy Report: Remember Me studio Dontnod filing for bankruptcy] (January 31, 2014) CEO Oskar Guilbert: "After *Remember Me*, the financial situation at Dontnod was very difficult. After that, we had to restructure the company and reinvent ourselves. Before, what we wanted to do was make big games with large teams and long production cycles... So we had to change that, do something smaller with smaller teams. We didn’t want to do just a small game, we also wanted to bring something new to the market, and we did it pretty well with *Life is Strange*."[https://www.mcvuk.com/business-news/how-life-is-strange-changed-dontnod/ How Life is Strange changed Dontnod] (October 25, 2016) 

*Life is Strange* is the studio's second game and breakthrough title, published by . At the time, most prospective publishers were unwilling to publish the game unless it featured more action sequences[https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-s-life-is-strange-considered-100-diffe/1100-6425742/ Square Enix's Life is Strange Considered 100 Different Names] (March 6, 2015) or had a male protagonist due to "little sales potential"[https://www.gamespot.com/articles/other-publishers-told-us-to-make-it-a-male-lead-ch/1100-6424577/ "Other Publishers Told Us to Make It a Male Lead Character," Life is Strange Dev Says] (January 10, 2015)[https://v1.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/139401-Publishers-Disliked-Dontnods-Life-is-Strange-Having-Female-Leads Publishers Wanted Life is Strange Devs to Make Leads Male] (January 11, 2015), a problem they had already faced with their first title, *Remember Me*.[https://www.gamespot.com/articles/publishers-said-you-cant-have-a-female-character-says-remember-me-dev/1100-6405550/ Publishers said 'You can't have a female character,' says Remember Me dev] (March 19, 2013) CEO Oskar Guilbert had also challenged the idea at the start.Barnes, Ben (June 2016). "Edge #293". Edge. p. 94-97: Future plc. Square Enix, who loved the game's storytelling element, was the only publisher that supported the project with no intention to change it. Originally, Dontnod had pitched a larger game to Square Enix that the publisher was not interested in, whereupon Dontnod chose to present their smaller narrative project *What If?*[https://www.mcvuk.com/business-news/they-originally-pitched-a-different-game-how-square-enix-discovered-life-is-strange/ ‘They originally pitched a different game’: how Square Enix discovered Life Is Strange] (August 7, 2015), which would later be retitled to *Life is Strange*.The game was originally codenamed "What If" but then retitled to distinguish itself from the film of the same name. Dontnod had considered over 100 different titles, including "Chrysalis", which would later be used as the first episode's title. Before signing with Square Enix, *Life is Strange* was imagined as a full-length video game that Dontnod would self-publish. However, the publisher surmised that it would be more successful as an episodic title. The episodic format, which had become a successful phenomenon through Telltale Games' releases, was adapted due to financial reasons as a "slow risk" approach, as well as marketing and creative reasons, allowing them to tell the story in its preferred slow pace.[https://www.mcvuk.com/business-news/life-is-good-dontnod-on-the-success-of-life-is-strange-and-what-comes-next/ Life is good: Dontnod on the success of Life is Strange and what comes next] (March 15, 2015)[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/26/life-is-strange-episodic-video-game-dontnodLife Is Strange: episodic video games prove as addictive as episodic TV] (April 26, 2015) An episodic game about a young girl with rewind powers, it builds on a central mechanism from their first game, *Remember Me*, the memory remixes. Its first episode was released in January 2015; all five episodes were released by October 2015. Development on this game actually began in April 2013 with a small team of 15 people. This increased to a staff of 40 after a year when Square Enix stepped in to support production in June 2014.Citation needed.Two months after signing their publishing contract with Square Enix, *Life Is Strange* was announced for PS3, Xbox 360 and PC at Gamescom on August 11, 2014.[http://dont-nod.com/en/studio/ Donntod Entertainment: Discover Our Story] 

*Life is Strange* was the saving grace for Dontnod and improved the studio's situation immensely from two years ago. The episodic narrative-driven adventure game has won multiple awards and sold in huge numbers, thanks in part to the publishing efforts of Square Enix. Whereas prior to *Life is Strange*, Dontnot had to work hard to find a publisher, now publishers would reach out to the studio on their own for collaboration. "It has completely transformed Dontnod," according to Oskar Guilbert.

Since then, the studio has taken on various other narrative projects. Their third game, ''*, released on June 5th, 2018, published by Focus Home Interactive. *Vampyr* is a role-playing game set in 1918, London. Dr. Jonathan Reid, a pioneer in blood transfusion methods, recently returned from the front at the end of WWI and turned into a vampire. The game follows Jonathan as he investigates the  (or what looks like it) and searches for *who* turned him and *why*; all the while he struggles between his thirst for blood and his  to cure people.

On July 27, 2016, the formation of Dontnod Eleven (formerly HeSaw) as a sister studio to Dontnod was announced, and that Dontnod helped them develop the side-scrolling shooter *Battlecrew: Space Pirates''. "The goal of our collaboration is to help those talented independent developers and benefit from their know-how", CEO Oskar Guilbert said.[http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-07-28-dontnod-deepens-collaboration-with-hesaw Dontnod deepens collaboration with Hesaw] (July 28, 2016)[https://www.polygon.com/2016/8/19/12550954/dontnod-eleven-battlecrew-space-pirates-life-is-strange Dontnod Eleven isn't catering to Life is Strange fans, and that’s the point] (August 19, 2016)

Michel Koch said in an interview in July 2016 that they have two teams at Dontnod, one working on Vampyr and one working on an exciting unannounced game, which later turned out to be *[Life is Strange 2](life_is_strange_2.md)* and was revealed on May 18, 2017. It was also revealed that the new season has been in development since the release of the Limited Edition in January 2016.[http://metro.co.uk/2016/07/27/life-is-strange-interview-live-action-web-series-and-sequel-talk-6033431/ Life Is Strange interview – live action web series and sequel talk] (July 27, 2016)

On August 22, 2017, it was revealed a new partnership with Bandai Namco for the creation of a brand-new IP on a new narrative adventure experience that has been in development since 2016. The story was said to take place in a fictional city in the US and will include a "fair dose of investigation". This new title is developed by a new team of senior devs. Hervé Hoerdt, VP of marketing and digital at Bandai Namco, said that they are aiming for triple-A quality, an emotional experience with investigation and psychologically deep characters with their partnership with Dontnod.[http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/exclusive-bandai-namco-partners-with-dontnod-on-new-narrative-adventure-ip/0186186 EXCLUSIVE: Bandai Namco partners with Life is Strange studio Dontnod on new narrative adventure IP] (August 22, 2017) On June 8, the name was revealed to be *Twin Mirror*.[https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/twin-mirror/news/help-sam-find-the-truth-and-unveil-basswood’s-secrets-upcoming-psychological Bandai Namco press release] (June 8, 2018) [https://web.archive.org/web/20180701140322/https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/twin-mirror/news/help-sam-find-the-truth-and-unveil-basswood%E2%80%99s-secrets-upcoming-psychological Archived](https___web_archive_org_web_20180701140322_https___en_bandainamcoent_eu_twin_mirror_news_help_sam_find_the_truth_and_unveil_basswood_e2_80_99s_secrets_upcoming_psychological_archived.md)

In June, 2017, it was announced that a prequel to Dontnod's *Life is Strange* was being developed by Denver-based studio [Deck Nine Games](deck_nine_games.md) partnered with publisher Square Enix. Dontnod was not involved in the game's production, which was helped by Square Enix's team that worked on the original *Life is Strange*, including Game Designer [Alejandro Arque](alejandro_arque.md). They were given access to Dontnod's game assets and original files that contain character arcs and backgrounds.[Media:Public-statement.jpg](public_statement.md) by the Life is Strange Community Manager. They communicated with Dontnod and flew to Paris for feedback.[http://us.blastingnews.com/gaming/2017/10/life-is-strange-before-the-storm-developers-reveal-reason-for-prequel-choice-002063603.html ‘Life is Strange: Before the Storm’ developers reveal reason for prequel choice] (October 4, 2017) Dontnod received special thanks in the credits of *Before the Storm*, saying, "A very special thank you to all of the amazing developers at DONTNOD. We've been honored to continue the amazing work you started in Arcadia Bay."

In April 2018, plans for an IPO were announced.[https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/financial-information/ipo.html Dontnod Financial Information] On May 23, 2018, the company was listed on Euronext.[https://live.euronext.com/en/ipo-showcase/dontnod-entertainment-sa Euronext listing][https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/dontnod-share.html Dontnod Share Information]

A free self-contained spin-off game that serves as a precursor to the events of *Life is Strange 2*, called *[The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit](the_awesome_adventures_of_captain_spirit.md)*, was announced on June 10, 2018, and released on June 26, 2018. It follows [Chris Eriksen](chris_eriksen.md), a 9-year-old boy who dreams of adventure. Chris is a character Dontnod came up with while working on *Life is Strange 2*, but they wanted to do something more in-depth with him.[https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/15/17464832/the-awesome-adventures-of-captain-spirit-life-is-strange The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit will pick up three years after Life is Strange] (June 15, 2018)

The announcement blog post for *Captain Spirit* from June 11, 2018, showed Square Enix and Dontnod Entertainment's interest in further expanding the *Life is Strange* universe[https://square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/announcing-the-awesome-adventures-of-captain-spirit Announcing the Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit] (June 11, 2018):

##  Trivia 
* The word "dontnod" is a palindrome, meaning it is spelled the same backwards as it is forwards.

* On January 27, 2015, a [Reddit AMA (Life is Strange)](reddit_ama.md) for *Life is Strange* was held. 
* The [Weatherman](weatherman.md), a character in *Life is Strange*, is based on and modeled by CEO Guilbert Oskar, as confirmed on *Life is Strange*'s official Twitter.[https://twitter.com/LifeIsStrange/status/717758674417098752 Twitter post]
