##  Lyrics 
: Some years ago
: I lived a hard life
: But sunlight burst a ray
: Through those clouds

: We've finally seen the back
: Of those grey days
: Please let the summer back to stay

: And hold a sunbird in your hands
: Don't let him sing too sweet
: For too soon the summer sun
: Will in winter sleep
: And hold a sunbird in your hands
: Don't let him sing too sweet
: For too soon the summer sun
: Will in winter sleep

: You found yourself on the road
: Inside your winter coat
: But leave your troubles behind, now
: You wrap yourself in a ball
: Then hide away from it all
: But let the sunbird in your heart

: And hold a sunbird in your hands
: Don't let him sing too sweet
: For too soon the summer sun
: Will in winter sleep
: And hold a sunbird in your hands
: Don't let him sing too sweet
: For too soon the summer sun
: Will in winter sleep

: OooooOoooOooo (x6)

: And hold a sunbird in your hands
: Don't let him sing too sweet
: For too soon the summer sun
: Will in winter sleep

##  Interpretation 
The song is used in the trailer for "Chrysalis" going free. This made the game available to more players, and for someone it may have been a reason to replay it. The first verse makes a reference to how the game has helped players through hard times. Immediately after a request is made for summer, i.e. happiness, to return."Please let the summer back to stay" The song tells us to appreciate the happy moments in life,"And hold the sunbird in your hands" but not too much, as they might end quickly."Don't let him sing too sweet, for too soon the summer sun will be in a winter sleep" The game is short, but despite that, it still provides a way to forget about everyday problems for a moment and lose yourself in a fictional world."But leave your troubles behind, now"
