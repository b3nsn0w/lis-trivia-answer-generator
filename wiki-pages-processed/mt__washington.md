##  Lyrics 
: Face stain in the ceiling 
: Why does it keep saying, 
: "I don't have to see you right now" 
: "I don't have to see you right now"

: Digging like you can bury 
: Something that cannot die 
: We could wash the dirt off our hands now 
: Keep it from living underground 
: Praise the summer goddess 
: You can tell a whole empire 
: "I don't have to see you right now" 
: "I don't have to see you right now"

: "I don't have to see you right now" (x4)
