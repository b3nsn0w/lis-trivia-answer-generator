**Max:** Kate!

*Max leans over and unlocks her phone. She has received a text from Chloe.*

**Chloe (SMS):** I have something to show you

**Chloe (SMS):** meet me in front of campus

**Chloe (SMS):** get dat ass in gear NOW

**Max:** I knew Chloe would be all over this... So I better get moving.

*Max puts her phone in her pocket and gets up from her desk.*

**Optional Conversation with Alice the Rabbit**

**Max:** *(thinking)* Are you a hungry bunny? Here, nosh on this...

*Max puts a small carrot in Alice's cage.*

*Max leaves her room to enter the hallway of the girls' dormitories.*

# ###  **Hallway** 
*Max steps out of her room and closes the door behind her. All the lights in the hallway have been turned off.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Okay, this is scary dark. Let there be...

*Max turns on the flashlight on her phone.*

# ###  **Showers** 
*Max enters the showers and puts her phone back in her pocket because the lights are on in the bathroom. Taylor stands next to a sink brushing her teeth.*

**Optional Conversation with Taylor**

*Max approaches Taylor, who turns around to face her.''

**Taylor:** Hey, Max...

''Max enters Victoria's room.*

# ###  *'Victoria's Room'* 
*Max opens the door to Victoria's room and goes inside. The lights in the room are all turned off, so Max uses the flashlight on her phone.*

**Max:** *(thinking)'' Since I've crossed the line from snoop to detective, I might as well search for clues about what really happened to Kate at the Vortex Club party.

''Max searches Victoria's room. After finding nothing of importance, she leaves the room.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* *[sighs]'' Nothing to see here... I guess I shouldn't be so bummed. Not that Victoria couldn't hide her shit... Man, *(chuckles)* I'm getting paranoid.

''Max enters Dana's room.*

**Chloe:** Get it? BOO-yah? Like I'm a scary punk ghost...

(Saved Kate)(Saved Kate)**Max:** More like a scary punk asshole. Hey, Chloe, I didn't exactly have the greatest day trying to keep my friend from jumping off the roof. I don't think I need you to prank me tonight, 'kay?

**Chloe:** Sorry, but you absolutely, balls-to-the-walls did save your friend!

**Max:** *[sighs]* Kate saved herself. I couldn't even use my power...my head felt like it was being crushed...then I had NO clue what to say to her on that roof...

**Chloe:** Don't be so modest, rock star. Kate is alive because of YOU. You obviously said the right thing. And your badass power is gonna save us all! We just...need to connect the players.

**Chloe:** I'm...I'm sorry, Max. I--I wasn't even thinking. *(sighing)* I suck.

**Max:** I'm not trying to be a bitch, but...I'll NEVER get the image out of my head of Kate jumping off that roof... All because my power didn't work... *[scoffs]* It didn't mean shit.

**Max:** And find out who really killed Kate.

**Max:** We have to stop this from happening to anybody else.

**Chloe:** Oh, yeah, and somehow stop that tornado from wiping out Arcadia Bay...right?

Don't joke.Don't joke.**Max:** Please don't joke about this, Chloe. Not right now.

**Chloe:** Max, I'm not laughing at you. My old counselor told me that my sarcasm was a way of "avoidance." That's why he's my ex-counselor.

**Chloe:** Drum roll, please... *[holds up a pair of keys]* I present the spare keys to Blackwell. Thank you, step-prick.

**Max:** You are such a boss, Chloe! *(hesitantly)* I just...don't want you to get into any more trouble...

**Victoria:** *(in background)* Thank you again SO much for helping me put together a portfolio.

''Max and Chloe hear Victoria and hide behind one of the boards on the main campus displaying Jefferson's photos.''

**Victoria:** I know this has been an awful day and you can talk to me anytime, Mr. Jefferson.

**Jefferson:** Thank you, Victoria.

|-|(Didn't save Kate)# (Didn't save Kate)**Jefferson:** I imagine...you're pretty upset over Kate as well...

**Victoria:** I'm, like, still in shock. I've never seen anybody die. I really cared about Katie.

**Jefferson:** "Katie"? I...had no idea you two were that close. Did she...?

**Victoria:** Well...how does this affect the Everyday Heroes contest?

(Jefferson is suspended from contest)(Jefferson is suspended from contest)**Jefferson:** The contest will go on, I just won't be representing Blackwell at the event this year thanks to Max, who claims I enabled Kate Marsh's trouble by merely listening to her.

|-|(Jefferson isn't suspended from contest)# (Jefferson isn't suspended from contest)**Jefferson:** It doesn't. The contest is still a-go and I still have to pick the winner to best represent Blackwell. I've got all the photos except one from...Max.

**Victoria:** I'll give you a one-word sneak preview of Max's photo: selfie. Listen...you've seen my entry, you know it's better than that. Wouldn't that be SO cool to hang out together in San Francisco, Mark?

**Jefferson:** I'm going to think that you didn't say any of that.

**Victoria:** You might as well choose me...otherwise I might have to tell people you offered to choose my photo for favors or something...

**Jefferson:** As a favor to your future, I'll also ignore that undisguised threat. This conversation is officially over, Miss Chase. I suggest you go back to your dorm now.

**Victoria:** Wait!

|-|(Didn't save Kate)# (Didn't save Kate)**Max:** Tell that to Kate...

*Max follows Chloe into the room. Chloe is attempting to unlock the second door.*

**Conversation with Chloe**

**Chloe:** That's it! *[looks down at the keys in her hand]* What the fuck? The security officer should have the key to the principal's office!

**Max:** He's hiding shit. Like EVERYBODY here.

**Chloe:** Well, now we definitely have to get this door open. Believe it or not, I know a little about lock-picking...thanks to Frank. *[crouches down near the door]* I might as well test out my thief skill...

**Max:** Go for it. We're already in this deep...

**Chloe:** *[turns toward Max]* Well, you could look for the key...just in case.

**Max:** Why, yes, I could...

''Max explores the surroundings but can't find the key to the office.''

**Max:** No key for thee... We have to find another way in.

**Chloe:** Guess I didn't spend enough time with Frank... But I'll use my DIY lock-pick tools while you come up with a better plan.

**Max:** My plan has a name...

*Max calls Warren on her cell phone.*

**Max:** Hey, Warren, you busy? *[Warren speaks inaudibly]* Just bubble-hearth, you'll be okay. Listen, I need your physics expertise, stat. Without naming names, if somebody had access to the art and science labs and wanted to construct a device that would, say, open a locked door, would you maybe kinda know how? *[Warren speaks inaudibly]* Huh? No...I'm just asking for fun. *[Warren speaks inaudibly]* Thanks, Science Guy. *[Warren speaks inaudibly]* Uh, n-no, no, no, stay. We need you as backup. Just send the text instructions NOW. *[Warren speaks inaudibly]*

*Max receives a text message from Warren with instructions.*

**Chloe:** Sorry, Max, I got nothin'. What about your plan?

**Max:** I'm gonna go put it together. Can you stay here and not get caught?

**Chloe:** I might get on the other side of that door before you, Lupin.

**Max:** The race is ON. See you soon.

*Max and Warren text each other about the instructions for building a pipe bomb. Max leaves the room to gather the four objects: sugar, a soda can, duct tape, and sodium chlorate.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Warren is such a classic nerd. Let's see if I can find those items...

*Max approaches the vending machine, inserting a coin and pressing the button for soda.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Release the kra-can!

*The soda can falls to the bottom slot and Max takes it.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* It's all mine anyway...

**Max:** *(thinking) [after getting first item]* Only three more items to go!

*Max enters the science lab.*

###  **Science Lab** 
**Max:** *(thinking)* Gross, I HATE that formalin smell...

''Max can look at Warren's exam grade on the desk. Warren's grade will differ depending on how much Max helped him in the previous episode. Max has the option to increase his grade.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* You deserve WAY more than this for taking on Nathan, but...every little grade counts...

*Max takes the box of sugar from the end of the desk.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Ooh, sugar.

**Max:** *(thinking) [after getting second item]'' You're halfway home, Max!

''Warren texts Max to check if she's okay. Max responds that she needs to concentrate but will talk to him later.*

**Optional Photo**

*Max looks at the fish in the aquarium.*

**Max:** *(thinking)'' Everybody's asleep... I hate to wake them up, but...I want a picture.

*Max turns on the light in the aquarium.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Good evening, fish-fish.

*Max takes a picture of the fish with her camera.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Thanks, fish. Nice work.

*Max can turn off the light in the aquarium.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Please resume your slumber.

*Max approaches one of the desks in the back of the room. She looks at page of a science textbook talking about sodium chlorate. The book mentions that it is "commonly used as a weedkiller".*

**Max:** *(thinking)* So sodium chlorate is...a weedkiller. *[scoffs]* You'd think Warren would've told me that factoid.

*Max goes to the back of the science lab. She looks at the container of weedkiller on the top of one of the cupboards.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Here's the sodium chlorate box.

*Max reaches her hand up to take the sodium chlorate, but withdraws it.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* You know you're clumsy, Max. Don't waste your rewind power. Use the damn chair!

*Max drags the chair over to the cupboard and steps up on it to take the sodium chlorate. Max returns the chair to its original position.*

**Max:** *(thinking) [after getting third item]* Only one more ingredient left...

*Max enters the the photography lab.*

###  **Photography Lab** 
**Max:** *(thinking)* This is like a scene in a horror film...

'''Max's Optional Comments About the Contest Pictures**

**Kate's entry**

**Max:'* *(thinking)* Oh, Kate...even when you were sad you tried to see the good in the world... Shit.

*'Victoria's entry**

**Max:'* *(thinking)* Victoria...that is pretty fucking sweet. How can I hate somebody that shoots like that?

*'Daniel's entry**

**Max:'* *(thinking)'' Daniel's a better illustrator than photographer... *[scoffs] (sarcastically)* Said Max the art critic.

'''Nathan's entry**

**Max:'* *(thinking)'' I feel gross even LOOKING at Nathan's work... *(reluctantly)* But he does have some style...

*Max goes to the back left corner of the room and takes the duct tape next to the printer.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* The tape is mine!

**Max:** *(thinking) [after getting last item]* Now it's time to show Chloe that Max is da bomb!

**Conversation with Chloe**

**Max:** ''[leans down and puts her hand on Chloe's shoulder]* Take it easy on the door, Chloe. *[she and Chloe stand up]'' Let's try this instead. *[shows Chloe pipe bomb]* Boom! Literally.

**Chloe:** Yes! Time to blow shit up!

*Max attaches the pipe bomb to the door handle.*

**Max:** If you'll light the candle...

**Chloe:** This is so cool!

*Chloe leans down and uses her lighter to light the fuse on the pipe bomb. Max and Chloe back away from the door.*

**Max:** Get ready to haul ass.

*Max and Chloe run to the side and crouch down behind the desk. The bomb explodes and the door is blasted open.*

**Chloe:** That...was so fucking cool!

*An alarm goes off.*

**Max:** Oh, we are toast! Here comes the whole Arcadia Bay Fire and Police Department!

**Chloe:** Uh, so what should we do?

''Max enters the principal's office and rewinds to before she and Chloe blasted the door open.*

**Chloe:** *(from behind the door)'' If I can get this bastard open she can't cheat with her rewind... This is bullshit! Fuck you, door!

*Max opens the door from the inside.*

###  '''Principal's Office** 

**Max:** Welcome to my domain.

**Chloe:'* You are magic! I have no clue how the hell you got in there, but you did it, sista! *[grabs Max arms, then lets go]''

**Max:** The company I keep... Now, let's find what we want and beat it. My powers only go so far.

**Chloe:** Man, I can see why the principal locks this room up. Fancy faux art crap. He must want everybody to know he has money...but no taste.

''Chloe approaches the principal's desk and turns on the lamp.''

**Chloe:** How can you trust somebody who has a fucking bronze bird in his office? I'm glad I was expelled...

**Max:** *(sarcastically)* Yes, if only the principal had a Monet or Picasso you'd still be at Blackwell...

**Chloe:** Eat me. *[starts searching the desk]* I'm gonna pilfer the papers on this ugly-ass desk.

*Chloe sits down in the chair behind the desk and leans back.*

**Chloe:** Okay, sure, it's ugly, but damn, is it a cozy chair!

*Chloe puts her feet up on the desk and swivels side to side in the chair.*

**Chloe:** This is your chance to truly get all deductive 'n' shit, Sherlock! *[takes feet off desk]* Find us some clues about Rachel...or Kate...or Nathan...anybody!

*Chloe begins searching the computer.*

**Max:** I'm on the case.

**Optional Conversation with Chloe**

**Chloe:** Dude, I know I shouldn't be going through the Principal's files but it's kind of cool.

Revenge on Blackwell.Revenge on Blackwell.**Max:** Now's your chance to get revenge on Blackwell...

**Max:** There's still time...

**Chloe:** Especially with you around, right?

**Max:** I don't want to make it a habit, okay?

**Chloe:** Whatever, crackhead. You're hooked.

**Max:** Don't talk. Search.

**Chloe:** Oooh, I like it when you get bossy. You're finally learning from the master...

*After searching through the files.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* I think we found everything in here... I should go join Chloe now.

**Chloe:** Max, you better come check out these files...

**Chloe:** Nathan accused Rachel of bringing drugs on campus? And my step-troll went along because he thinks Rachel was a bad influence on me.

**Chloe:** Assholes.

**Max:** If David is teaming up with Nathan Prescott... That's a bad sign.

**Chloe:** "Nathan Prescott the Third." Oooh, he's so money. And you know the Prescotts dropped major bank to bury Nathan's real file... Look, it reads like a rap sheet---bad grades, teacher complains, secret probation... But I was expelled?

(Max blamed Nathan)(Max blamed Nathan)**Max:** At least Nathan was finally suspended. Check out that note... Open it.

|-|(Max didn't blame Nathan)# (Max didn't blame Nathan)**Max:** The Prescotts always get their money's worth...Check out that note. Open it.

**Chloe:** That's just some crazy drawing...

**Max:** It's not a drawing... look, "Rachel in the dark room... Rachel in the dark room..." Over and over. That's it.

**Chloe:** That's... fucked up. What does this even mean? Nathan is truly psychotic. I know he has something to do with Rachel missing...

**Max:** Whoa, listen to this, "David M. always asks what's going on in my head... David M. always helps me follow those he follows..." Pretty cryptic

**Chloe:** No, it sounds like they've formed some sort of weird team---"The Super He-Bros."

**Max:** Jesus, David was stalking Kate, hassling me, and now we know he was all over Rachel too...

**Chloe:** Oh, we are so going into his garage files... Plus I'm getting a little paranoid in here. We got our info, let's bail. But maybe we shouldn't leave without a gift...

**Max:** No, you are not taking the cozy chair.

**Chloe:** Max, do your powers include mind-reading?

**Chloe:** Or did you just rewind because I tried to steal the chair? Shit, I'm confused.

**Max:** It's the powers of best friendship. I know how you roll... We should definitely get out here. We pressed our luck enough.

*Chloe opens a drawer underneath the computer and discovers an envelope.*

**Chloe:** Hullo, what have we here? Holy shit, jackpot! Cha-ching!

**Max:** Wowser, that's a lot for the "handicapped fund."

**Chloe:** Dude, there's five thousand dollars here. I could pay Frank back tonight!

(Frank didn't take the gun)(Frank didn't take the gun)**Chloe:** This will chill him out after you almost, you know, shot him.

|-|(Frank took the gun)# (Frank took the gun)**Chloe:** This will chill him out after our knife showdown yesterday...

**Chloe:** Are you going to make a big issue out of this? Or just rewind and take the greenbacks for yourself? I hope you do that instead of lecturing me.

LEAVE THE MONEYLEAVE THE MONEY**Max:** You really want to take money from the handicapped fund? I know you need to pay Frank back, but... I've got my power to protect you, right?

**Chloe:** There's a lot of power in that horse-choking wad of cash... *[puts the money back in]* but yes, Moral Max is right again. I guess... *[gets up from the chair and turns off the lamp]* Let's get the hell out of this office morgue.

''Chloe leaves the principal's office.*

**Max:** *(thinking)'' I know that money would have helped Chloe and me...

|-|STEAL THE MONEY# STEAL THE MONEY**Max:** Frank knows things about Rachel and he might talk if he's been paid... Right?

**Chloe:** You are SuperMax.

*Chloe gets up from the chair and hugs Max.*

**Chloe:** And with the leftover dough, I'll take you on a road trip to Portland for the day. We'll stock up on tats, beer, weed, and donuts.

**Max:** And books from Powell's.

**Chloe:** And strip clubs... Kidding! But you never know...

*Chloe turns off the lamp and leaves the office.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* I feel like shit for taking that money...

''Max leaves the principal's office. Chloe is waiting for her near the door.''

**Max:** That impish look scares me.

**Chloe:** Care for a midnight swim? The Blackwell pool is ours.

**Max:** Swimming? You want to take that risk now?

(Left the money)(Left the money)**Chloe:** It's been a cray week. You didn't let me take that money to pay off Frank, so if he pops a cap in my skull at least allow me to have a little carefree fun for a few minutes... Splish splash?

|-|(Stole the money)# (Stole the money)**Chloe:** It's been a cray week, we deserve a little mindless fun in the water... We're done for the night anyway, we're rich, and nobody busted us. So, splish splash?

**Max:** You're right. We hella deserve it. Splish splash!

**Chloe:** Did you actually just say "hella"? I think I'm a good bad influence on you.

*Max and Chloe exit the Blackwell building.*

###  **Swimming Pool** 
*Max and Chloe enter the swimming pool building.*

**Max:** We're in the Otters' lair!

**Chloe:** Big fucking deal. I want that heated water!

(Max was suspended)(Max was suspended)**Max:** We still have to play it cool, okay? Even if I'm suspended.
|-|(Max wasn't suspended)# (Max wasn't suspended)**Max:** We still have to play it cool, okay? I still go to school here.

**Chloe:** You can own this hellhole once you figure out your rewind power...

*Chloe walks slightly further into the corridor.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Chloe is so psyched for "girls' night out" so, I better follow her evil plan.

*Max talks to Chloe.*

**Chloe:** Boys or girls?

Boys' locker room.Boys' locker room.**Max:** Boys, of course!

**Chloe:** Figures. Perv.

|-|Girls' locker room.# Girls' locker room.**Max:** Girls, of course!

**Chloe:** Girls? Ooh la-la...

**Chloe:** Let me check to see if the pool's heated...

*Chloe opens the door to one of the changing rooms and walks over to the pool.*

*Optional: Max enters the changing room and rewinds to before Chloe opened the door. She opens the door for Chloe and gestures inside.*

**Max:** Presto!

**Chloe:** Dude, it's getting old! Try and dazzle me with another trick!

*Chloe enters and walks over to the pool.*

**Optional Conversation with Chloe**

**Chloe:** Max, try to find the light for the pool. I want to see the sharks!

**Max:** Otters don't like sharks. They bite.

**Chloe:** So do I... Hit that light!

''Max enters the lifeguard's room and presses the light switch. Chloe takes off her clothes and jumps into the pool. Max approaches the pool and talks to Chloe.''

(Left the money)(Left the money)**Chloe:** Ohh yeah, baby! Feels like a hot tub! Too bad you made me feel like the Queen of Assholes because I wanted that cash stash...

|-|(Stole the money)# (Stole the money)**Chloe:** Oh yeah, baby! Feels like a hot tub! And with my cash stash I'm queen of the world! Bow!

**Chloe:** Tell me you're not going to stand there watching me like a zombie.

*Max smiles. Chloe splashes water on Max.*

**Max:** Don't you dare...

**Chloe:** Come stop me, hippie!

**Max:** Okay, you asked for it!

*Max takes off her clothes and jumps into the pool.*

**Max:** Cowabunga!

**Chloe:** Why look, an otter in my water! Duuuun dun, duuuuun dun, dun dun dun dun dun dun...

**Max:** You're so obvious. And I still get freaked out by that movie, so stop. I can't even watch any of those shark shows.

*Max and Chloe start splashing water on each other.*

**Max:** I'll just rewind and harpoon you. Otter's revenge!

**Chloe:** Cheater!

**Max:** Yeah, you would know about that!

*Chloe lies on her back. Max does the same slightly later.*

**Chloe:** I wish Rachel was here. She would totally love being in here at night. Wish you guys had met each other...

**Max:** We will. With all this stuff going on, I'm starting to think everything is related...

(Saved Kate)(Saved Kate)**Max:** And I want to find out for Kate's sake. She almost died today...
|-|(Couldn't save Kate)# (Couldn't save Kate)**Max:** And I want to find out why for Kate's sake. She didn't deserve to die...

**Chloe:** Your power is changing everything, Max. Especially you. I can already tell. You're not so chickenshit anymore.

*Max and Chloe swim towards the pool border.*

**Max:** Thanks, girlfriend.

**Chloe:** You know what I mean. You're becoming like this force of nature.

**Max:** More like luck of nature. Come on, my power failed trying to rescue Kate... Maybe I'm just stumbling back and forth in time... for what reason?

**Chloe:** You didn't stumble when you saved me, Max.

What if I had?What if I had?
{{#tag:tabber|(Saved Kate)# (Saved Kate)**Max:** Thank God. But... what if I had? What if? Kate didn't jump but you would be... dead...

}}

|-|Thanks to you.# Thanks to you.**Max:** Not that time. But that's because you were there to kickstart my power...

**Chloe:** So it's time to start moving forward in time. And we're obviously connected since without me you would have never discovered your power, right?

Absolutely.Absolutely.**Max:** Absolutely. You make me feel like I know what I'm doing...

**Chloe:** And you make me feel like I have a reason for still being in Arcadia Bay.

**Max:** I hope so...

|-|I don't know.# I don't know.**Max:** I don't know...

**Chloe:** Well I do, okay? So just listen to Captain Chloe.

**Max:** I'm trying. As long as we don't waste this power...

**Chloe:** Stop being so goddamn humble. You're like the smartest, most talented person I've ever known.

**Max:** More than Rachel Amber?

**Chloe:** Dude, I'm not her groupie, okay? And I'm sure you have Blackwell bros all over youâ€”like Warren...

You're the bro killer.You're the bro killer.**Max:** You're the bro killer. Tats and 'tude...

**Chloe:** You did not just say that. Plus I am not down with these Arcadia Bay hillbillies.

**Max:** I don't blame you... Anyway, we have bigger fish to fry, right?

|-|Warren is nice...# Warren is nice...**Max:** Warren is nice...

**Chloe:** *[chuckles]* Nice? Ouch. That means "Friendzone."

**Max:** No, he's really cool. It was so sweet when he stood up to Nathan... But I haven't told him about my rewind power...

|-|Gross!Gross!**Max:** Ew! I don't want any Blackwell bros over me. There's a couple cute guys there but they probably think I'm a total nerd.

**Chloe:** Uh, nerds are hot. You just don't have any confidence yet.

**Max:** Unfortunately, that didn't come with my rewind power...

**Chloe:** No worries. Once you get over yourself, you're going to make the world bow.

**Max:** As long as you're there with me...

**Chloe:** Don't look so sad. I'm never leaving you...

*Max and Chloe swim away from the pool border.*

**Max:** Now I'm getting cold in here.

**Chloe:** Because we're yapping instead of attacking each other, otter-versus-shark style... I think I've had my pool experience for the year, let's jet.

**Max:** Let's call it a draw. I'm gonna freeze my ass off when I get out...

*Max and Chloe get out of the pool and put their clothes back on.*

**Max:** Gross, I feel like we just went swimming in Chlorine Bay.

**Chloe:** You look cute with your hair soaked in chemicals.

**Max:** Thanks, you would know...

*A guard opens a door in the background.*

**Max and Chloe (to each other):** Hide!

''Chloe runs to the pool's entrance through the girls' locker room. Max runs to the same place through the boys' locker room. Max and Chloe try to exit the pool but are stopped an approaching guard.*

(David is on leave)# (David is on leave)**Guard:** Make sure you cover the whole perimeter!

*An unknown guard opens the door and shines his flashlight into the empty space.''

|-|(David isn't on leave)(David isn't on leave)**David:** Make sure you cover the whole perimeter!

*David opens the door and shines his flashlight into the empty space.*

**Max:** Are you shitting me?

''Max and Chloe run back into the pool rooms. Chloe hides between the lockers and a wall in the girls' locker room. Max has to hide among the shower stalls.*

*'Guards' Comments About the Search**

**Guard:''' Better not try any Halloween pranks after today... I'm serious.

**Guard:** Hello?

**Guard:** Where are they?

**Guard:** I heard something over here.

**Guard:** Who's here?

**Guard:** I got a flashlight and a stick!

**Guard:** Anybody there?!

**Guard:** Hey!

*Max goes back into the pool area. Chloe approaches Max from behind and they hug each other.*

**Max:** We are so invisible!

**Chloe:** Let's bail!

*Max and Chloe run out of the pool building into the parking lot. They try to reach the dorms but are stopped by a guard who is going towards them.*

**Max:** Wait, turn around, they're coming! We have to find another way out!

*Max and Chloe climb down and start walking along the wall.*

**Chloe:** This is bullshit. You can't go back to your dorm now, you're a Blackwell fugitive! Crash at my place tonight.

(David is on leave)# (David is on leave)**Max:** You want me to crash where the Blackwell security officer I just busted lives, so I'll be safe? Okay!

|-|(David isn't on leave)(David isn't on leave)**Max:** You want me to crash where the Blackwell security officer lives so I'll be safe? Okay!

''Max and Chloe start running towards Chloe's truck.*

**Chloe:** Into the car!

*Chloe enters her truck.*

**Chloe:** Get in!

*Max enters Chloe's truck. The girls drive away from Blackwell to Chloe's house.*

**Chloe:** Hahaha! Later, fuckers! Max, you rock! We are so fucking awesome!

**Max:** Yes, we so are...

*Chloe parks her truck in front of the house. Max and Chloe enter inside and climb to Chloe's room.*

##  **Madsen Household** 
###  **Upstairs** 
*Max and Chloe are lying on Chloe's bed. Max wakes up and looks at Chloe.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Always remember this moment.

*Max takes her camera from the floor to take a selfie. Chloe wakes up as well.*

**Chloe:** Photobomb!

**Max:** Photo-hog!

*Max takes a selfie with Chloe.''

**Max:** It feels like a different world from yesterday...

**Chloe:** We left a skid mark on Blackwell last night.

**Max:** Like it needs another one. I'd like to do something good for my school and Arcadia Bay. I can't even submit my photo to represent... I just don't want to be rejected.

**Chloe:** Every great artist gets rejected before they get accepted. So you have to enter a photo.

**Max:** Even though I'm pimping the school and town you want to torch?

**Chloe:** Come on, I don't want to see Arcadia Bay burned to the shore, I just say shit like that because I've been trying to get out of here sinceâ€”since you left, basically. If I could find Rachel, then pay Frank off, I'm still leaving to start a whole new life...

*Chloe grabs the remote control for her Hi-Fi and turns on the music.*

**Max:** Wish we could just hang out all morning like we used to... Maybe we should get up, I have to get back to Blackwell soon.

(Max is suspended)# (Max is suspended)**Chloe:** No, you don't. You're suspended, criminal.

**Max:** Nobody suspended my homework. If I don't turn it in, the school will contact my folks again. And Max gets in more trouble.

|-|(Max is not suspended)(Max is not suspended)**Chloe:** Oh, does the schoolgirl have a test today?

**Max:** I'm starting to feel like going to Blackwell every day is a test. I just need to get on my regular school schedule again.

**Optional Conversation with Chloe on the Bed**

**Chloe:** I am so wiped out from last night. But it was awesome.

**Max:** I have to ponder what kind of criminal I've become.

**Chloe:** Last night was only the tip of the iceberg.

**Max:** I have to admit, it was pretty cool to take over the Blackwell gym.

**Chloe:** Today the gym, tomorrow the world. We need to step it up.

**Max:** We still have to be careful how I use my power... I don't want to get stuck in time.

*Max gets up.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Okay, I need to get dressed now.

**Optional Conversation with Chloe**

**Max:** I love this morning light, it's so peaceful...

**Chloe:** Wouldn't it be wicked if we could just hang out here forever like when we were kids?

Yes.# Yes.**Max:** Yes, but... sadly we're not kids anymore.

**Chloe:** At least you can date now, right? My dad was terrified of the day I would discover boys.

{{#tag:tabber|Did you have a boyfriend?Did you have a boyfriend?**Max:** So... you never really told me if you had a serious boyfriend while I was away...

**Chloe:** Not serious. Hella stupid, usually. I went through a "boy toy" phase. Among other things...

**Max:** I can't see you with any of the guys around here...

**Chloe:** Because you have a good eye. That's why I was so glad Rachel came along to rescue me.

{{#tag:tabber|You crushed on Rachel?# You crushed on Rachel?**Max:** Sounds like you totally crushed on Rachel.

**Chloe:** Sorry, sorry. Didn't mean to get you all worked up. I just don't think anybody is good enough for you... besides me.

|-|Like Rachel? (after "No" and rewind)Like Rachel? (after "No" and rewind)**Max:** Yep. I bet you and Rachel liked hanging out here too...

**Chloe:** You know it. She reminded me of you when we faked sleep so our parents wouldn't make us get up too early Saturday morning...

**Max:** Did you guys have a lot of sleepovers?

**Chloe:** As many as possible. But it was more fun at her place. Step-commando wanted us up at the ass-crack of dawn... It's cool to be back here with you.

|-|No.# No.**Max:** No, too easy. And there's too much shit going on now...

**Chloe:** Oh, okay, Queen of the World. I'll try not to remind you of when we were besties anymore. Rachel loved hanging out with me here, she would have understood... Forget it.

*Max looks at her clothes.*

**Max:** Ew. Still reeks like a chlorine factory.

**Chloe:** See if you can find a suitable outfit in my fashion hole.

*Max opens the closet.*

**Max:** Okay, time for some Chloe cosplay...

**Chloe:** Hey, there you go! Rachel left a bunch of her clothes with me... She's your size.

**Max:** But not quite my style.

**Chloe:** Max, you don't have a style yet. At least give it a try. You can always rewind back to your chlorine brand T-shirt and generic jeans.

**Max:** You suck. I like my shirt and jeans... but it would be cool to try on Rachel's clothes, just to see if they fit.

**Chloe:** Stop second-guessing yourself, Max! Put this on and let your inner punk-rock girl come out! You can afford to take chances! Whenever and whatever you want to try... for example, I dare you to kiss me!

**Max:** What?

**Chloe:** I double dare you. Kiss me now.

KISS CHLOEKISS CHLOE*Max leans forward and kisses Chloe. Chloe backs away in surprise.*

**Chloe:** Damn, you're hardcore, Max! Now I can text Warren and tell him he doesn't stand a chance... unless he's into girl-on-girl action.

**Max:** You are such a dork.

**Max:** *(thinking)* Oh man, that was priceless when I kissed Chloe. She didn't think I would...

**Max:** I am so going to best unfriend you for that.

|-|(Didn't kiss Chloe)# (Didn't kiss Chloe)**Chloe:** I bet you totally used your rewind to mack on me just so you could act like you didn't... Come on girl, confess!

''Max puts on Rachel's shirt and jeans. She then stands in front of Chloe.''

**Chloe:** Lookin' sick, Max. A couple tats, some piercings and we'll make a thrasher out of you yet.

**Max:** Ready for the mosh pit, shaka brah.

**Chloe:** Maybe not. Go on down and say hi to Joyce. Free breakfast! I have to, er, wake 'n' bake first.

**Max:** I promise not to tell.

**Chloe:** Let's not rewind and find out, 'kay?

''Max exits Chloe's room.*

**Max:** *(thinking)'' Oh my God, that smells so amazing... It's like when we were kids here.

*Optional: Max plays the phone message.*

**Officer Corn:** David, this is Officer Corn... Just wanted to let you know your stepdaughter's car was identified near the Blackwell campus last night around the time of the break-ins... Give me a call soon...

**Joyce:** What!? Are you in trouble again, Chloe? Don't you sleep?

(Max decides to delete the message)(Max decides to delete the message)**Answering machine:** Message deleted.

*Max speaks to Joyce, who is cooking a meal in the kitchen.*

**Max:** Good morning, Joyce...

**Joyce:** Rachel! Uh... Iâ€”I mean, Max... Whew, you startled me. You fit those clothes well. Thank God you're not a hellraiser like her or Chloe. Now tell me exactly what you want to chow on.

Pancakes.# Pancakes.**Max:** I'm dying for some of your famous pancakes.

**Joyce:** I thought you would have missed those. You ate more than William, and he loved them...

**Max:** I remember. We would race each other to grab them from the stack.

**Joyce:** So this time you can help me with the ingredients. I need you to grab me the eggs and milk.

**Max:** *(thinking)* Eggs and milk, no problemo.

**Max:** *(thinking)* "The eggs always come first," as Joyce used to say...

*Max takes the milk from the living room table.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Now for the mother's milk...

|-|Eggs and bacon.Eggs and bacon.**Max:** Eggs and bacon all the way.

**Joyce:** Remember when you guys would sleep in until I yelled out, "Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey!"

**Max:** Totally. We'd wake up so fast.

**Joyce:** So this time you can help me with the ingredients. I need you to grab me the actual eggs and the bacon.

**Max:** *(thinking)* I can handle eggs and bacon.

*Max takes the eggs from the kitchen*

**Max:** *(thinking)* "The eggs always come first," as Joyce used to say...

*Max takes the bacon from inside the fridge.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* I should evolve and become a vegan but... Huh, bacon.

*Max gives the ingredients to Joyce.*

**Joyce:** Thanks... After all these years and everything that's happened, it's great to see you and Chloe together again. She hasn't had a good friend since you or Rachel... Those clothes remind me so much of her. Such a sweet girl. I'm just hoping she's living large in L.A.

**Max:** I'd love to think that too, Joyce. But...

**Joyce:** We're on the same page, Max. I keep hoping that Rachel will show up or even send a message to Chloe from Hollywood... or wherever she is...

Rachel in trouble.# Rachel in trouble.**Max:** I hate to even think this, much less say it out loud... but I think Rachel is in serious trouble.

**Joyce:** I know. I watch those awful true crime shows and it makes me ill if I think about Rachel ending up on one... So I don't think too much.

**Max:** I see why Chloe is so obsessed with finding her...

|-|Is Rachel okay?Is Rachel okay?**Max:** Be honest, Joyce... do you think Rachel is okay?

**Joyce:** God, I hope so. She wasâ€”is smart and she always landed on her feet. Maybe I don't know her as well as I thought... Maybe Chloe doesn't either.

**Max:** Sometimes I feel like I don't know Chloe as well as I thought...

|-|Was Rachel mad at Chloe?# Was Rachel mad at Chloe?**Max:** Is there any reason that Rachel might be mad at Chloe and left without her?

**Joyce:** Chloe could piss everybody off but her. They were almost joined at the head. Reminded me of you and Chloe... But Rachel wasn't as grounded as you.

**Max:** I'm grounded? Since when? Maybe that's why Chloe likes Rachel so much...

**Joyce:** Max Caulfield, are you actually jealous of Rachel?

Maybe.Maybe.**Max:** Maybe. Rachel was so much cooler than me...

**Joyce:** You think? Then why has Chloe been telling me she wishes she could be more like you over the past five years?

**Max:** Doubt it. Uh... did she really? Five years ago feels like a thousand now...

|-|No way.# No way.**Max:** What? No way. I know I was selfish when I left. I'm glad Chloe found a better friend.

**Max:** But it seems like Chloe and me were pirates a thousand years ago...

**Joyce:** And that makes me, what, a century old? You're only 18, Max. Ah, youth... if only I could go back...

**Max:** It's not all that, Joyce...

**Joyce:** Voila, a breakfast fit for us queens... and a king. Go sit at the table.

*Max sits at the living room table and waits for breakfast. Joyce bring the plate a few seconds later.*

**Max:** Thank you so much, Joyce. I'm never leaving this table.

**Joyce:** Good. You can clean.

''Max eats her breakfast. Joyce comes at the table a minute later and bring the Prices' photo album with her.*

**Joyce:** Seeing you again... ahh, made me remember so much...

*Joyce puts the album on the table.''

**Joyce:** I know these photos don't measure up to your work, Max...

**Max:** My favorite photographers probably take pictures similar to yours. You make David happy, Joyce.

**Joyce:** He wants us all to be happy, Max. He's just not great at showing it.

*Max sees a photo of Rachel wearing the same shirt Max is wearing at the moment.*

**Max:** Uhh, I don't think I can rock this outfit like Rachel...

**Joyce:** You have your own cool style.

*Max sees a photo of her and Chloe cooking pancakes in 2008.*

**Max:** Wowser, I totally remember that day...

**Joyce:** I'm glad... William took this picture with his instant camera. It was the last picture he ever took... He had his car out right after this andâ€”and...

**Max:** I know, Joyce. I'm sorry...

**Joyce:** I didn't show you this to be morbid. In fact, I want you to have this... This was when my baby was so full of life and light. She was hopeful, positive... everything she's not today. And this was the last time I ever saw Chloe truly happy.

*Joyce gives the photo to Max. Chloe comes downstairs and enters the living room.*

**Chloe:** Did you guys have a bonding session about how fucked up I am?

**Max:** It's not always about you...

**Joyce:** Chloe, please. It's too early to start picking a fight. Eat instead.

**Chloe:** I'll keep the warden busy while you go peek in the garage.

**Joyce:** Now stop whispering or I'll know you're talking about me.

**Chloe:** Stop being so nosey, mother. Jeez, I can't do anything around here without everybody getting up in my shit...

**Joyce:** No one can even joke with you, Chloe, you fly off the handle like that...

**Max:** Excuse me, I have to use the bathroom.

**Chloe:** Sure, run off and pee when you should back me up.

**Joyce:** Now who's being paranoid? Just listen to yourself...

**Chloe:** Nobody else does!

''Max enters David's garage.*

**Max:** *(thinking)'' I do need to get into David's computer. He's gotta be hiding shit.

''Max tries to unlock David's computer.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* No shit it needs a password... How about "stepdouche"... Try again! I need more clues...

*Max searches David's garage for password hints. She finds a receipt from the Two Whales Diner behind the visor of David's car.*

**Max:** *(thinking)'' Joyce might as well have wrote "Let's get married."

*Max looks at the other side of the receipt.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* That might be a useful password...

''Max enters the password into David's laptop and successfully unlocks it.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Score! Max the Hacker strikes again!

*Max examines the profiles of Rachel, Kate and herself on David's computer.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* I better tell Chloe about this now... Just one more thing to make her sad. And mad.

*Max approaches Chloe. At the same time, David enters the house.''

**David:** Nice breakfast.

**Joyce:** David, you're back already?

(David is on leave)(David is on leave)**David:** That's what happens when you lose your job as head of Blackwell security.

**Joyce:** What happened?

**David:** What you would expect to happen in this P.C. college bullshit ageâ€”the Principal takes the words of lying stoned students over a veteran and law professional.

**Joyce:** Ugh, again? This isn't the first time you've gotten in trouble there...

**David:** Well, now it's the last time. I'll get a lawyer to sue their ass.

|-|(David isn't on leave)# (David isn't on leave)**David:** I have to take a nap after writing up vandalism reports last night.

**Joyce:** What happened?

**David:** Some little shitass punks broke in to the swimming pool. This is what happens at these P.C. bullshit colleges. Entitled students taking over the campus!

**Joyce:** Do you know for sure it was Blackwell students?

**David:** Who else would do it? And I'm going to bust them.

*David turns to Max*.

**David:** Figures you'd be here. Is that your Rachel Amber Halloween costume?

**Max:** You know more about her than me!

|-|(David isn't on leave)# (David isn't on leave)**Joyce:** Leave Max alone, David. Stop threatening students.

**Chloe:** He threatens them with surveillance cameras. So he can spy on everybody... like he spies on all of us here.

**David:** Don't start, Chloe.

**Chloe:** Yeah, I'm just always starting shit, right? You're a total paranoid, David.

**David:** Not now, Chloe.

**Chloe:** You used to call me a loser for getting kicked out of Blackwell... So who's the loser now, David? Who haven't you accused or harassed? Between your investigations into Rachel and Kate, what have you done besides get in trouble?

SIDE WITH DAVIDSIDE WITH DAVID**Max:** Listen, we don't know that David did anything and nobody has any proof against him. As far as we know, it's Nathan Prescott who's the real threat so far. I would cut David slack here...

**Chloe:** Oh would you? How generous, King Max. So suddenly it doesn't matter how shady David has been acting, or that he keeps all those weird files on your classmates, or how you're always going off on how creepy Davidâ€”

**Joyce:** Enough! I don't want anybody being accused of anything. There's been too much of that crap going on around here lately and I don't want it in my home today.

**David:** Well, I agree with that. Now if you all don't mind, I'd like to forget about work and sit down, and eat some of this incredible grub...

**Chloe:** I have to take a dump. Are you coming, Max?

*David and Joyce sit at the table. Chloe goes towards the front door of the house.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Maybe I went too easy on David for Joyce's sake...

**Optional Conversation with David**

**David:** Thanks again for defending me, Max. But this is my family now.

**Optional Conversation with Joyce**

**Joyce:** Max, I appreciate you sticking up for David... and our family. Even if Chloe doesn't.

**Max:** So is spying on people in your family and at your work. Why do you have photos of Kate Marsh and Rachel Amber in your files anyway?

**Joyce:** What? Is this true, Max? Yes, David, why do you have these files at all? I find this very disturbing.

**David:** I do not have to take this kind of interrogation. Not from you punks!

**Joyce:** Maybe you should calm down...

**David:** Oh, you're turning on me now? Of course, women always stick together. Well, screw you!

**Joyce:** David... you better go to a hotel until we figure this out...

**David:** You can't kick me out of my own home!

**Joyce:** It's my home, David. Paid for and in my name. You know the law, right?

**David:** I thought I knew a lot of things... like when I'm outflanked.

**Chloe:** Have a nice day.

**Joyce:** Chloe, for once... just please shut up.

*David goes to the door leading to the backyard. Joyce sits at the table. Chloe goes towards the front door of the house.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* I hope Joyce doesn't hate me for tearing into David...

**Optional Conversation with David**

**David:** I don't want to see or hear you again, Max. You've hurt me and my family enough.

**Optional Conversation with Joyce**

**Joyce:** Max, don't beat yourself up. David earned this all by himself, understand?

**Optional Conversation with Chloe**

**Chloe:** Max, that gave me chills. And you better not rewind this one!

''Max and Chloe exit Chloe's house and drive towards the Two Whales Diner.''

##  **Diner** 

**Max:** Listen, when I went through David's laptop, I found pictures of Rachel and Frank... being more than friends.

**Chloe:** Right. No way, Max. She was just posing to tease Frank.

**Max:** If you're not gonna believe me, why don't we check out what Frank has in his RV?

**Chloe:** What's that gonna prove?

**Max:** Frank has Rachel's bracelet. What else does he have in there?

**Chloe:** Motherfucker better not have anything. For his sake.

*Frank is eating breakfast inside the diner. Chloe parks the car.*

**Chloe:** Let's check the door. Frank gets so wasted he sometimes forgets to lock it.

*Max and Chloe approach the RV.*

**Max:** I can't believe you hung out with him.

**Chloe:** Not anymore. We have to be casual ninjas here...

*Chloe tries the door; it is locked, and Pompidou begins barking from inside.*

**Chloe:** Shitballs. Okay, here's the plan. I'll go to the diner and distract Frank by telling him I have his money, but he needs to come with me. Then you come in and rewind so Frank doesn't see me, then you can tell Frank he needs to check out his RV and then you rewind after you get the key, and... uh... and...

**Max:** Chloe, I got this. Be right back.

*Max walks towards the diner.*

**Chloe:** Don't let my epic plan get in the way of yours. I'll try to scrounge up a Scooby snack to distract his mangy mutt...

**Max:** *(thinking)* Now to find a quick and easy way to snag Frank's keys.

*Max receives a text message from her father.*

**Frank:** I won't even let you pick up the dog shit.

*Frank takes out his keys and places them on the table.*

**Frank:** Besides, you don't want a leashâ€”you want these keys right here. Look at your eyes dilate. You're worse than a junkie, Max. But no fix for you.

**Taylor:** All my friends in [Los Angeles](la.md) told me that Oregon was gonna be wet and cold every day, but it's like 75 degrees and I haven't seen the rain once since I got here. Is that climate change?

**Max:** No... I'd never do that to Chloe.

**William:** Speaking of...I know she's been dying to see you. Hold on.

*William turns around and steps back into the house.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* So Chloe is waiting for me in front of the main hall.

###  **Janitor room** # 

**Max:** *(thinking)* Oh, it's unlocked! I hope Samuel isn't around...

###  **Squirrel (optional photo)** # 

*While focusing with her camera...*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Look at the lens and say "Nut!"

###  **Principal Wells** #

**Principal Wells:** Ah, fuck it! I'm sitting my ass down. Nobody can expel me! Not yet, anyway...

**Max:** *(thinking)* Great. So how do I get past him to meet Chloe?

*Max rewinds and sneaks past Principal Wells before he turns around.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Max the Ninja strikes again!

**Chloe:** *[jumps out at Max]* BOO-YAH!

*Max clutches her chest, looking shocked.*

**Chloe:** Get it? BOO-yah? Like I'm a scary punk ghost...

(Saved Kate)(Saved Kate)**Max:** More like a scary punk asshole. Hey, Chloe, I didn't exactly have the greatest day trying to keep my friend from jumping off the roof. I don't think I need you to prank me tonight, 'kay?

**Chloe:** Sorry, but you absolutely, balls-to-the-walls did save your friend!

**Max:** *[sighs]* Kate saved herself. I couldn't even use my power...my head felt like it was being crushed...then I had NO clue what to say to her on that roof...

**Chloe:** Don't be so modest, rock star. Kate is alive because of YOU. You obviously said the right thing. And your badass power is gonna save us all! We just...need to connect the players.

**Max:** And find out who almost killed Kate. *[sighs]*

|-|(Didn't save Kate)# (Didn't save Kate)**Max:** More like a scary insensitive asshole. Chloe, I watched my friend jump off a roof today. I don't think you need to prank me tonight. You always trip out on me for not being there for YOU, but is this how you're there for me?

**Chloe:** I'm...I'm sorry, Max. I--I wasn't even thinking. *(sighing)* I suck.

**Max:** I'm not trying to be a bitch, but...I'll NEVER get the image out of my head of Kate jumping off that roof... All because my power didn't work... *[scoffs]* It didn't mean shit.

**Chloe:** I know seeing Kate fall was horrible. I don't even know how to deal with that, so I just...act like an idiot. But it's YOUR badass power that's gonna bring all this to a close. We just need to connect the players.

**Max:** And find out who really killed Kate.

**Max:** We have to stop this from happening to anybody else.

**Chloe:** Oh, yeah, and somehow stop that tornado from wiping out Arcadia Bay...right?

Don't joke.Don't joke.**Max:** Please don't joke about this, Chloe. Not right now.

**Chloe:** Max, I'm not laughing at you. My old counselor told me that my sarcasm was a way of "avoidance." That's why he's my ex-counselor.

|-|I hope so.# I hope so.**Max:** I hope so, Chloe...but how? Snow and eclipse are bad omens.

About Kate.About Kate.**Max:** Right. For one thing, there's too much coincidence between the people around Kate and Rachel.

**Chloe:** Fuck the truth, I just wanna find my friend right now... It scares me to think where she could be... Do you think she's...?

Alive?# Alive?**Max:** Alive? I HAVE to think that, Chloe. Her spirit is SO powerful here...

**Chloe:** Maybe too much power...

**Chloe:** Max, we have to find Rachel soon. We have to...

**Max:** I promise you we will. Like you said, it's time to start the search for clues. Now tell me, what's your secret?

**Chloe:** Drum roll, please... *[holds up a pair of keys]* I present the spare keys to Blackwell. Thank you, step-prick.

**Max:** You are such a boss, Chloe! *(hesitantly)* I just...don't want you to get into any more trouble...

**Chloe:** As long as you're my partner in time.

**Max:** Insert groan here...

**Victoria:** *(in background)* Thank you again SO much for helping me put together a portfolio.

''Max and Chloe hear Victoria and hide behind one of the boards on the main campus displaying Jefferson's photos.''

**Jefferson:** Hopefully, the rest of the class will follow your lead. I'm sorry I was...distracted. As you know, it's not been a good day for Blackwell.

**Victoria:** I know this has been an awful day and you can talk to me anytime, Mr. Jefferson.

**Jefferson:** Thank you, Victoria.

(Saved Kate)(Saved Kate)**Jefferson:** I'm glad it had a relatively happy ending.

**Victoria:** I don't know what I would've done if Katie jumped...

|-|(Didn't save Kate)# (Didn't save Kate)**Jefferson:** I imagine...you're pretty upset over Kate as well...

**Victoria:** I'm, like, still in shock. I've never seen anybody die. I really cared about Katie.

**Jefferson:** "Katie"? I...had no idea you two were that close. Did she...?

**Victoria:** Well...how does this affect the Everyday Heroes contest?

(Jefferson is suspended from contest)(Jefferson is suspended from contest)**Jefferson:** The contest will go on, I just won't be representing Blackwell at the event this year thanks to Max, who claims I enabled Kate Marsh's trouble by merely listening to her.

|-|(Jefferson isn't suspended from contest)# (Jefferson isn't suspended from contest)**Jefferson:** It doesn't. The contest is still a-go and I still have to pick the winner to best represent Blackwell. I've got all the photos except one from...Max.

**Victoria:** I'll give you a one-word sneak preview of Max's photo: selfie. Listen...you've seen my entry, you know it's better than that. Wouldn't that be SO cool to hang out together in San Francisco, Mark?

|-|(Jefferson isn't suspended from contest)# (Jefferson isn't suspended from contest)**Jefferson:** Stick to Mr. Jefferson, Victoria, please? And, uh...I haven't picked a winner yet.

*Jefferson starts to leave, but Victoria grabs his arm and stops him.*

**Victoria:** You already love my work, so it's not like you're playing favorites. Just imagine if you picked my photo, though...we would have to spend a LOT of time together... That could be...fun, don't you think?

**Jefferson:** I'm going to think that you didn't say any of that.

**Victoria:** You might as well choose me...otherwise I might have to tell people you offered to choose my photo for favors or something...

**Jefferson:** As a favor to your future, I'll also ignore that undisguised threat. This conversation is officially over, Miss Chase. I suggest you go back to your dorm now.

**Victoria:** Wait!

**Max:** I'm serious. We're not kids anymore. We're breaking and entering...

**Chloe:** If I have a key, how can it be breaking? They can't charge us for just entering!

**Max:** I'm serious. We could go to jail...

|-|(David isn't on leave)# (David isn't on leave)**Chloe:** Not if I'm related to the head of Blackwell security. Step-shit will not want me in the hands of the local police...

**Chloe:** So we better find out what's in the principal's office first. You can rewind if we get caught, right? You have mad powers, Max.

*Chloe begins unlocking the door.*

(Saved Kate)(Saved Kate)**Max:** But my powers didn't save Kate... Maybe I did on my own...

|-|(Didn't save Kate)# (Didn't save Kate)**Max:** Tell that to Kate...

*Chloe unlocks the door and enters the room inside.*

**Chloe:** Come on. One more door and our work here is done.

*Max follows Chloe into the room. Chloe is attempting to unlock the second door.*

**Conversation with Chloe**

**Chloe:** That's it! *[looks down at the keys in her hand]* What the fuck? The security officer should have the key to the principal's office!

**Max:** He's hiding shit. Like EVERYBODY here.

**Chloe:** Well, now we definitely have to get this door open. Believe it or not, I know a little about lock-picking...thanks to Frank. *[crouches down near the door]* I might as well test out my thief skill...

*Chloe begins attempting to pick the lock on the door.*

**Max:** Go for it. We're already in this deep...

**Chloe:** *[turns toward Max]* Well, you could look for the key...just in case.

**Max:** Why, yes, I could...

''Max explores the surroundings but can't find the key to the office.''

**Max:** No key for thee... We have to find another way in.

**Chloe:** Guess I didn't spend enough time with Frank... But I'll use my DIY lock-pick tools while you come up with a better plan.

**Max:** My plan has a name...

*Max calls Warren on her cell phone.*

**Max:** Hey, Warren, you busy? *[Warren speaks inaudibly]* Just bubble-hearth, you'll be okay. Listen, I need your physics expertise, stat. Without naming names, if somebody had access to the art and science labs and wanted to construct a device that would, say, open a locked door, would you maybe kinda know how? *[Warren speaks inaudibly]* Huh? No...I'm just asking for fun. *[Warren speaks inaudibly]* Thanks, Science Guy. *[Warren speaks inaudibly]* Uh, n-no, no, no, stay. We need you as backup. Just send the text instructions NOW. *[Warren speaks inaudibly]*

|-|(Max declined Warren's invitation)# (Max declined Warren's invitation)**Max:** I'm sorry, I'm just not sure about a movie night right now. Don't hate me... And thanks for the help.

**Max:** Try not to wake up everybody at Blackwell!

*Max receives a text message from Warren with instructions.*

**Chloe:** Sorry, Max, I got nothin'. What about your plan?

**Max:** I'm gonna go put it together. Can you stay here and not get caught?

**Chloe:** I might get on the other side of that door before you, Lupin.

**Max:** The race is ON. See you soon.

*Max and Warren text each other about the instructions for building a pipe bomb. Max leaves the room to gather the four objects: sugar, a soda can, duct tape, and sodium chlorate.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Warren is such a classic nerd. Let's see if I can find those items...

*Max approaches the vending machine, inserting a coin and pressing the button for soda.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Release the kra-can!

*The soda can falls to the bottom slot and Max takes it.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* It's all mine anyway...

**Max:** *(thinking) [after getting first item]* Only three more items to go!

*Max enters the science lab.*

###  **Science Lab** 
**Max:** *(thinking)* Gross, I HATE that formalin smell...

''Max can look at Warren's exam grade on the desk. Warren's grade will differ depending on how much Max helped him in the previous episode. Max has the option to increase his grade.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* You deserve WAY more than this for taking on Nathan, but...every little grade counts...

*Max takes the box of sugar from the end of the desk.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Ooh, sugar.

**Max:** *(thinking) [after getting second item]'' You're halfway home, Max!

''Warren texts Max to check if she's okay. Max responds that she needs to concentrate but will talk to him later.*

**Optional Photo**

*Max looks at the fish in the aquarium.*

**Max:** *(thinking)'' Everybody's asleep... I hate to wake them up, but...I want a picture.

*Max turns on the light in the aquarium.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Good evening, fish-fish.

*Max takes a picture of the fish with her camera.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Thanks, fish. Nice work.

*Max can turn off the light in the aquarium.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Please resume your slumber.

*Max approaches one of the desks in the back of the room. She looks at page of a science textbook talking about sodium chlorate. The book mentions that it is "commonly used as a weedkiller".*

**Max:** *(thinking)* So sodium chlorate is...a weedkiller. *[scoffs]* You'd think Warren would've told me that factoid.

*Max goes to the back of the science lab. She looks at the container of weedkiller on the top of one of the cupboards.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Here's the sodium chlorate box.

*Max reaches her hand up to take the sodium chlorate, but withdraws it.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* You know you're clumsy, Max. Don't waste your rewind power. Use the damn chair!

*Max drags the chair over to the cupboard and steps up on it to take the sodium chlorate. Max returns the chair to its original position.*

**Max:** *(thinking) [after getting third item]* Only one more ingredient left...

*Max enters the the photography lab.*

###  **Photography Lab** 
**Max:** *(thinking)* This is like a scene in a horror film...

'''Max's Optional Comments About the Contest Pictures**

**Kate's entry**

**Max:'* *(thinking)* Oh, Kate...even when you were sad you tried to see the good in the world... Shit.

*'Victoria's entry**

**Max:'* *(thinking)* Victoria...that is pretty fucking sweet. How can I hate somebody that shoots like that?

*'Daniel's entry**

**Max:'* *(thinking)'' Daniel's a better illustrator than photographer... *[scoffs] (sarcastically)* Said Max the art critic.

'''Nathan's entry**

**Max:'* *(thinking)'' I feel gross even LOOKING at Nathan's work... *(reluctantly)* But he does have some style...

*Max goes to the back left corner of the room and takes the duct tape next to the printer.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* The tape is mine!

**Max:** *(thinking) [after getting last item]* Now it's time to show Chloe that Max is da bomb!

**Conversation with Chloe**

**Max:** ''[leans down and puts her hand on Chloe's shoulder]* Take it easy on the door, Chloe. *[she and Chloe stand up]'' Let's try this instead. *[shows Chloe pipe bomb]* Boom! Literally.

**Chloe:** Yes! Time to blow shit up!

*Max attaches the pipe bomb to the door handle.*

**Max:** If you'll light the candle...

**Chloe:** This is so cool!

*Chloe leans down and uses her lighter to light the fuse on the pipe bomb. Max and Chloe back away from the door.*

**Max:** Get ready to haul ass.

*Max and Chloe run to the side and crouch down behind the desk. The bomb explodes and the door is blasted open.*

**Chloe:** That...was so fucking cool!

*An alarm goes off.*

**Max:** Oh, we are toast! Here comes the whole Arcadia Bay Fire and Police Department!

**Chloe:** Uh, so what should we do?

''Max enters the principal's office and rewinds to before she and Chloe blasted the door open.*

**Chloe:** *(from behind the door)'' If I can get this bastard open she can't cheat with her rewind... This is bullshit! Fuck you, door!

*Max opens the door from the inside.*

###  '''Principal's Office** 

**Max:** Welcome to my domain.

**Chloe:'* You are magic! I have no clue how the hell you got in there, but you did it, sista! *[grabs Max arms, then lets go]''

**Max:** The company I keep... Now, let's find what we want and beat it. My powers only go so far.

**Chloe:** Man, I can see why the principal locks this room up. Fancy faux art crap. He must want everybody to know he has money...but no taste.

''Chloe approaches the principal's desk and turns on the lamp.''

**Chloe:** How can you trust somebody who has a fucking bronze bird in his office? I'm glad I was expelled...

**Max:** *(sarcastically)* Yes, if only the principal had a Monet or Picasso you'd still be at Blackwell...

**Chloe:** Eat me. *[starts searching the desk]* I'm gonna pilfer the papers on this ugly-ass desk.

*Chloe sits down in the chair behind the desk and leans back.*

**Chloe:** Okay, sure, it's ugly, but damn, is it a cozy chair!

*Chloe puts her feet up on the desk and swivels side to side in the chair.*

**Chloe:** This is your chance to truly get all deductive 'n' shit, Sherlock! *[takes feet off desk]* Find us some clues about Rachel...or Kate...or Nathan...anybody!

*Chloe begins searching the computer.*

**Max:** I'm on the case.

**Optional Conversation with Chloe**

**Chloe:** Dude, I know I shouldn't be going through the Principal's files but it's kind of cool.

Revenge on Blackwell.Revenge on Blackwell.**Max:** Now's your chance to get revenge on Blackwell...

**Chloe:** Oh yeah, I'm so bummed I don't get to party with the Vortex Club.

**Max:** There's still time...

**Chloe:** Especially with you around, right?

|-|Be careful.# Be careful.**Max:** Just please don't accidentally delete his hard drive or anything.

**Chloe:** Like you can't rewind and fix it.

**Max:** I don't want to make it a habit, okay?

**Chloe:** Whatever, crackhead. You're hooked.

**Max:** Don't talk. Search.

**Chloe:** Oooh, I like it when you get bossy. You're finally learning from the master...

*After searching through the files.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* I think we found everything in here... I should go join Chloe now.

**Chloe:** Max, you better come check out these files...

**Chloe:** Nathan accused Rachel of bringing drugs on campus? And my step-troll went along because he thinks Rachel was a bad influence on me.

**Chloe:** Assholes.

**Max:** If David is teaming up with Nathan Prescott... That's a bad sign.

**Chloe:** "Nathan Prescott the Third." Oooh, he's so money. And you know the Prescotts dropped major bank to bury Nathan's real file... Look, it reads like a rap sheet---bad grades, teacher complains, secret probation... But I was expelled?

(Max blamed Nathan)(Max blamed Nathan)**Max:** At least Nathan was finally suspended. Check out that note... Open it.

|-|(Max didn't blame Nathan)# (Max didn't blame Nathan)**Max:** The Prescotts always get their money's worth...Check out that note. Open it.

**Chloe:** That's just some crazy drawing...

**Max:** It's not a drawing... look, "Rachel in the dark room... Rachel in the dark room..." Over and over. That's it.

**Chloe:** That's... fucked up. What does this even mean? Nathan is truly psychotic. I know he has something to do with Rachel missing...

**Max:** Whoa, listen to this, "David M. always asks what's going on in my head... David M. always helps me follow those he follows..." Pretty cryptic

**Chloe:** No, it sounds like they've formed some sort of weird team---"The Super He-Bros."

**Max:** Jesus, David was stalking Kate, hassling me, and now we know he was all over Rachel too...

**Chloe:** Oh, we are so going into his garage files... Plus I'm getting a little paranoid in here. We got our info, let's bail. But maybe we shouldn't leave without a gift...

**Max:** No, you are not taking the cozy chair.

**Chloe:** Max, do your powers include mind-reading?

**Chloe:** Or did you just rewind because I tried to steal the chair? Shit, I'm confused.

**Max:** It's the powers of best friendship. I know how you roll... We should definitely get out here. We pressed our luck enough.

*Chloe opens a drawer underneath the computer and discovers an envelope.*

**Chloe:** Hullo, what have we here? Holy shit, jackpot! Cha-ching!

**Max:** Wowser, that's a lot for the "handicapped fund."

**Chloe:** Dude, there's five thousand dollars here. I could pay Frank back tonight!

(Frank didn't take the gun)(Frank didn't take the gun)**Chloe:** This will chill him out after you almost, you know, shot him.

|-|(Frank took the gun)# (Frank took the gun)**Chloe:** This will chill him out after our knife showdown yesterday...

**Chloe:** Are you going to make a big issue out of this? Or just rewind and take the greenbacks for yourself? I hope you do that instead of lecturing me.

LEAVE THE MONEYLEAVE THE MONEY**Max:** You really want to take money from the handicapped fund? I know you need to pay Frank back, but... I've got my power to protect you, right?

**Chloe:** There's a lot of power in that horse-choking wad of cash... *[puts the money back in]* but yes, Moral Max is right again. I guess... *[gets up from the chair and turns off the lamp]* Let's get the hell out of this office morgue.

''Chloe leaves the principal's office.*

**Max:** *(thinking)'' I know that money would have helped Chloe and me...

|-|STEAL THE MONEY# STEAL THE MONEY**Max:** Frank knows things about Rachel and he might talk if he's been paid... Right?

**Chloe:** You are SuperMax.

*Chloe gets up from the chair and hugs Max.*

**Chloe:** And with the leftover dough, I'll take you on a road trip to Portland for the day. We'll stock up on tats, beer, weed, and donuts.

**Max:** And books from Powell's.

**Chloe:** And strip clubs... Kidding! But you never know...

*Chloe turns off the lamp and leaves the office.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* I feel like shit for taking that money...

''Max leaves the principal's office. Chloe is waiting for her near the door.''

**Max:** That impish look scares me.

**Chloe:** Care for a midnight swim? The Blackwell pool is ours.

**Max:** Swimming? You want to take that risk now?

(Left the money)(Left the money)**Chloe:** It's been a cray week. You didn't let me take that money to pay off Frank, so if he pops a cap in my skull at least allow me to have a little carefree fun for a few minutes... Splish splash?

|-|(Stole the money)# (Stole the money)**Chloe:** It's been a cray week, we deserve a little mindless fun in the water... We're done for the night anyway, we're rich, and nobody busted us. So, splish splash?

**Max:** You're right. We hella deserve it. Splish splash!

**Chloe:** Did you actually just say "hella"? I think I'm a good bad influence on you.

*Max and Chloe exit the Blackwell building.*

###  **Swimming Pool** 
*Max and Chloe enter the swimming pool building.*

**Max:** Presto!

**Chloe:** Dude, it's getting old! Try and dazzle me with another trick!

*Chloe enters and walks over to the pool.*

**Optional Conversation with Chloe**

**Chloe:** Max, try to find the light for the pool. I want to see the sharks!

**Max:** Otters don't like sharks. They bite.

**Chloe:** So do I... Hit that light!

''Max enters the lifeguard's room and presses the light switch. Chloe takes off her clothes and jumps into the pool. Max approaches the pool and talks to Chloe.''

**Max:** Don't you dare...

**Chloe:** Come stop me, hippie!

**Max:** Okay, you asked for it!

*Max takes off her clothes and jumps into the pool.*

**Max:** Cowabunga!

**Chloe:** Why look, an otter in my water! Duuuun dun, duuuuun dun, dun dun dun dun dun dun...

**Max:** You're so obvious. And I still get freaked out by that movie, so stop. I can't even watch any of those shark shows.

*Max and Chloe start splashing water on each other.*

**Max:** I'll just rewind and harpoon you. Otter's revenge!

**Chloe:** Cheater!

**Max:** Yeah, you would know about that!

*Chloe lies on her back. Max does the same slightly later.*

**Chloe:** I wish Rachel was here. She would totally love being in here at night. Wish you guys had met each other...

**Max:** We will. With all this stuff going on, I'm starting to think everything is related...

*Max and Chloe swim towards the pool border.*

**Max:** Thanks, girlfriend.

**Chloe:** You know what I mean. You're becoming like this force of nature.

**Max:** More like luck of nature. Come on, my power failed trying to rescue Kate... Maybe I'm just stumbling back and forth in time... for what reason?

**Chloe:** So it's time to start moving forward in time. And we're obviously connected since without me you would have never discovered your power, right?

Absolutely.Absolutely.**Max:** Absolutely. You make me feel like I know what I'm doing...

**Chloe:** And you make me feel like I have a reason for still being in Arcadia Bay.

**Max:** I hope so...

|-|I don't know.# I don't know.**Max:** I don't know...

**Chloe:** Well I do, okay? So just listen to Captain Chloe.

**Max:** I'm trying. As long as we don't waste this power...

**Max:** More than Rachel Amber?

**Chloe:** Dude, I'm not her groupie, okay? And I'm sure you have Blackwell bros all over youâ€”like Warren...

**Chloe:** No worries. Once you get over yourself, you're going to make the world bow.

**Max:** As long as you're there with me...

**Chloe:** Don't look so sad. I'm never leaving you...

*Max and Chloe swim away from the pool border.*

**Max:** Now I'm getting cold in here.

**Chloe:** Because we're yapping instead of attacking each other, otter-versus-shark style... I think I've had my pool experience for the year, let's jet.

**Max:** Let's call it a draw. I'm gonna freeze my ass off when I get out...

*Max and Chloe get out of the pool and put their clothes back on.*

**Max:** Gross, I feel like we just went swimming in Chlorine Bay.

**Chloe:** You look cute with your hair soaked in chemicals.

**Max:** Thanks, you would know...

**Max:** Like it needs another one. I'd like to do something good for my school and Arcadia Bay. I can't even submit my photo to represent... I just don't want to be rejected.

**Chloe:** Every great artist gets rejected before they get accepted. So you have to enter a photo.

**Max:** Even though I'm pimping the school and town you want to torch?

**Chloe:** Come on, I don't want to see Arcadia Bay burned to the shore, I just say shit like that because I've been trying to get out of here sinceâ€”since you left, basically. If I could find Rachel, then pay Frank off, I'm still leaving to start a whole new life...

**Chloe:** I am so wiped out from last night. But it was awesome.

**Max:** I have to ponder what kind of criminal I've become.

**Chloe:** Last night was only the tip of the iceberg.

**Max:** I have to admit, it was pretty cool to take over the Blackwell gym.

**Chloe:** Wouldn't it be wicked if we could just hang out here forever like when we were kids?

Yes.# Yes.**Max:** Yes, but... sadly we're not kids anymore.

{{#tag:tabber|Did you have a boyfriend?Did you have a boyfriend?**Max:** So... you never really told me if you had a serious boyfriend while I was away...

|-|Like Rachel? (after "No" and rewind)Like Rachel? (after "No" and rewind)**Max:** Yep. I bet you and Rachel liked hanging out here too...

**Chloe:** You know it. She reminded me of you when we faked sleep so our parents wouldn't make us get up too early Saturday morning...

**Max:** Did you guys have a lot of sleepovers?

**Chloe:** As many as possible. But it was more fun at her place. Step-commando wanted us up at the ass-crack of dawn... It's cool to be back here with you.

|-|No.# No.**Max:** No, too easy. And there's too much shit going on now...

**Max:** But not quite my style.

**Chloe:** Max, you don't have a style yet. At least give it a try. You can always rewind back to your chlorine brand T-shirt and generic jeans.

**Max:** You suck. I like my shirt and jeans... but it would be cool to try on Rachel's clothes, just to see if they fit.

**Chloe:** Stop second-guessing yourself, Max! Put this on and let your inner punk-rock girl come out! You can afford to take chances! Whenever and whatever you want to try... for example, I dare you to kiss me!

**Max:** What?

**Chloe:** I double dare you. Kiss me now.

**Chloe:** Maybe not. Go on down and say hi to Joyce. Free breakfast! I have to, er, wake 'n' bake first.

Pancakes.# Pancakes.**Max:** I'm dying for some of your famous pancakes.

**Max:** I remember. We would race each other to grab them from the stack.

**Joyce:** So this time you can help me with the ingredients. I need you to grab me the eggs and milk.

**Max:** *(thinking)* Eggs and milk, no problemo.

**Max:** *(thinking)* "The eggs always come first," as Joyce used to say...

*Max takes the milk from the living room table.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Now for the mother's milk...

|-|Eggs and bacon.Eggs and bacon.**Max:** Eggs and bacon all the way.

**Joyce:** Remember when you guys would sleep in until I yelled out, "Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey!"

**Max:** Totally. We'd wake up so fast.

**Max:** *(thinking)* I can handle eggs and bacon.

*Max takes the eggs from the kitchen*

**Max:** *(thinking)* "The eggs always come first," as Joyce used to say...

*Max takes the bacon from inside the fridge.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* I should evolve and become a vegan but... Huh, bacon.

*Max gives the ingredients to Joyce.*

**Joyce:** Thanks... After all these years and everything that's happened, it's great to see you and Chloe together again. She hasn't had a good friend since you or Rachel... Those clothes remind me so much of her. Such a sweet girl. I'm just hoping she's living large in L.A.

**Max:** I'd love to think that too, Joyce. But...

**Joyce:** We're on the same page, Max. I keep hoping that Rachel will show up or even send a message to Chloe from Hollywood... or wherever she is...

Rachel in trouble.# Rachel in trouble.**Max:** I hate to even think this, much less say it out loud... but I think Rachel is in serious trouble.

**Joyce:** I know. I watch those awful true crime shows and it makes me ill if I think about Rachel ending up on one... So I don't think too much.

**Max:** I see why Chloe is so obsessed with finding her...

|-|Is Rachel okay?Is Rachel okay?**Max:** Be honest, Joyce... do you think Rachel is okay?

**Joyce:** God, I hope so. She wasâ€”is smart and she always landed on her feet. Maybe I don't know her as well as I thought... Maybe Chloe doesn't either.

**Max:** Sometimes I feel like I don't know Chloe as well as I thought...

|-|Was Rachel mad at Chloe?# Was Rachel mad at Chloe?**Max:** Is there any reason that Rachel might be mad at Chloe and left without her?

**Joyce:** Chloe could piss everybody off but her. They were almost joined at the head. Reminded me of you and Chloe... But Rachel wasn't as grounded as you.

**Max:** I'm grounded? Since when? Maybe that's why Chloe likes Rachel so much...

**Joyce:** Max Caulfield, are you actually jealous of Rachel?

Maybe.Maybe.**Max:** Maybe. Rachel was so much cooler than me...

**Joyce:** You think? Then why has Chloe been telling me she wishes she could be more like you over the past five years?

**Max:** Doubt it. Uh... did she really? Five years ago feels like a thousand now...

|-|No way.# No way.**Max:** What? No way. I know I was selfish when I left. I'm glad Chloe found a better friend.

**Joyce:** And that makes me, what, a century old? You're only 18, Max. Ah, youth... if only I could go back...

**Max:** It's not all that, Joyce...

**Joyce:** Voila, a breakfast fit for us queens... and a king. Go sit at the table.

*Max sits at the living room table and waits for breakfast. Joyce bring the plate a few seconds later.*

**Max:** Thank you so much, Joyce. I'm never leaving this table.

**Joyce:** Good. You can clean.

''Max eats her breakfast. Joyce comes at the table a minute later and bring the Prices' photo album with her.*

**Joyce:** Seeing you again... ahh, made me remember so much...

*Joyce puts the album on the table.''

**Joyce:** I know these photos don't measure up to your work, Max...

**Max:** My favorite photographers probably take pictures similar to yours. You make David happy, Joyce.

**Joyce:** He wants us all to be happy, Max. He's just not great at showing it.

*Max sees a photo of Rachel wearing the same shirt Max is wearing at the moment.*

**Max:** Uhh, I don't think I can rock this outfit like Rachel...

**Joyce:** You have your own cool style.

*Max sees a photo of her and Chloe cooking pancakes in 2008.*

**Max:** Wowser, I totally remember that day...

**Joyce:** I'm glad... William took this picture with his instant camera. It was the last picture he ever took... He had his car out right after this andâ€”and...

**Max:** I know, Joyce. I'm sorry...

**Joyce:** I didn't show you this to be morbid. In fact, I want you to have this... This was when my baby was so full of life and light. She was hopeful, positive... everything she's not today. And this was the last time I ever saw Chloe truly happy.

*Joyce gives the photo to Max. Chloe comes downstairs and enters the living room.*

**Chloe:** Did you guys have a bonding session about how fucked up I am?

**Max:** It's not always about you...

**Joyce:** Chloe, please. It's too early to start picking a fight. Eat instead.

**Chloe:** I'll keep the warden busy while you go peek in the garage.

**Joyce:** Now stop whispering or I'll know you're talking about me.

**Chloe:** Stop being so nosey, mother. Jeez, I can't do anything around here without everybody getting up in my shit...

**Joyce:** No one can even joke with you, Chloe, you fly off the handle like that...

**Max:** Excuse me, I have to use the bathroom.

**Chloe:** Sure, run off and pee when you should back me up.

**Joyce:** Now who's being paranoid? Just listen to yourself...

**Chloe:** Nobody else does!

''Max enters David's garage.*

**Max:** *(thinking)'' I do need to get into David's computer. He's gotta be hiding shit.

''Max tries to unlock David's computer.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* No shit it needs a password... How about "stepdouche"... Try again! I need more clues...

*Max searches David's garage for password hints. She finds a receipt from the Two Whales Diner behind the visor of David's car.*

**Max:** *(thinking)'' Joyce might as well have wrote "Let's get married."

*Max looks at the other side of the receipt.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* That might be a useful password...

''Max enters the password into David's laptop and successfully unlocks it.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Score! Max the Hacker strikes again!

*Max examines the profiles of Rachel, Kate and herself on David's computer.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* I better tell Chloe about this now... Just one more thing to make her sad. And mad.

*Max approaches Chloe. At the same time, David enters the house.''

**David:** Nice breakfast.

(David is on leave)(David is on leave)**David:** That's what happens when you lose your job as head of Blackwell security.

**Joyce:** What happened?

**David:** What you would expect to happen in this P.C. college bullshit ageâ€”the Principal takes the words of lying stoned students over a veteran and law professional.

**Joyce:** Ugh, again? This isn't the first time you've gotten in trouble there...

**David:** Well, now it's the last time. I'll get a lawyer to sue their ass.

|-|(David isn't on leave)# (David isn't on leave)**David:** I have to take a nap after writing up vandalism reports last night.

|-|(David isn't on leave)# (David isn't on leave)**Joyce:** Leave Max alone, David. Stop threatening students.

**Chloe:** Yeah, I'm just always starting shit, right? You're a total paranoid, David.

**David:** Not now, Chloe.

**Chloe:** You used to call me a loser for getting kicked out of Blackwell... So who's the loser now, David? Who haven't you accused or harassed? Between your investigations into Rachel and Kate, what have you done besides get in trouble?

SIDE WITH DAVIDSIDE WITH DAVID**Max:** Listen, we don't know that David did anything and nobody has any proof against him. As far as we know, it's Nathan Prescott who's the real threat so far. I would cut David slack here...

**Chloe:** Oh would you? How generous, King Max. So suddenly it doesn't matter how shady David has been acting, or that he keeps all those weird files on your classmates, or how you're always going off on how creepy Davidâ€”

**Joyce:** Enough! I don't want anybody being accused of anything. There's been too much of that crap going on around here lately and I don't want it in my home today.

**David:** Well, I agree with that. Now if you all don't mind, I'd like to forget about work and sit down, and eat some of this incredible grub...

**Chloe:** I have to take a dump. Are you coming, Max?

*David and Joyce sit at the table. Chloe goes towards the front door of the house.*

**Max:** *(thinking)* Maybe I went too easy on David for Joyce's sake...

**Max:** *(thinking)* I hope Joyce doesn't hate me for tearing into David...

**Optional Conversation with David**

**David:** I don't want to see or hear you again, Max. You've hurt me and my family enough.

**Optional Conversation with Joyce**

**Joyce:** Max, don't beat yourself up. David earned this all by himself, understand?

**Optional Conversation with Chloe**

**Chloe:** Max, that gave me chills. And you better not rewind this one!

''Max and Chloe exit Chloe's house and drive towards the Two Whales Diner.''

##  **Diner** 

**Max:** Listen, when I went through David's laptop, I found pictures of Rachel and Frank... being more than friends.

**Chloe:** Right. No way, Max. She was just posing to tease Frank.

**Max:** If you're not gonna believe me, why don't we check out what Frank has in his RV?

**Chloe:** What's that gonna prove?

**Max:** Frank has Rachel's bracelet. What else does he have in there?

**Chloe:** Motherfucker better not have anything. For his sake.

*Frank is eating breakfast inside the diner. Chloe parks the car.*

**Chloe:** Let's check the door. Frank gets so wasted he sometimes forgets to lock it.

*Max and Chloe approach the RV.*

**Max:** I can't believe you hung out with him.

**Chloe:** Not anymore. We have to be casual ninjas here...

*Chloe tries the door; it is locked, and Pompidou begins barking from inside.*

**Chloe:** Shitballs. Okay, here's the plan. I'll go to the diner and distract Frank by telling him I have his money, but he needs to come with me. Then you come in and rewind so Frank doesn't see me, then you can tell Frank he needs to check out his RV and then you rewind after you get the key, and... uh... and...

**Max:** Chloe, I got this. Be right back.

*Max walks towards the diner.*

**Chloe:** Don't let my epic plan get in the way of yours. I'll try to scrounge up a Scooby snack to distract his mangy mutt...

**Max:** *(thinking)* Now to find a quick and easy way to snag Frank's keys.

*Max receives a text message from her father.*
