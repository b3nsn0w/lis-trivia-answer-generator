The **Science Lab**, also known as the **Science Classroom**, is one of the four main labs at [Blackwell Academy](blackwell_academy.md). It is equipped with chemicals and biology equipment.
[Michelle Grant](michelle_grant.md) teaches science to Blackwell's students in this lab.

##  Episode Two - "[Episode 2: Out of Time](out_of_time.md)" 
During Episode 2, [Maxine Caulfield](max.md) can explore the science lab, where Max gets the opportunity to help out [Warren Graham](warren.md) with his science experiment. Max can either fail or succeed in helping him by asking [Michelle Grant](mrs__grant.md), which will lead to an [Optional Photos](optional_photo.md) opportunity.

Max can also talk with [Brooke](brooke.md), who comments that Warren is ignoring the real genius.

##  Episode Three - "[Episode 3: Chaos Theory](chaos_theory.md)" 
During Max and [Chloe Price](chloe.md)'s night investigation at Blackwell, Max is able to visit the science lab, particularly to find ingredients for a pipe bomb to open the [Principal Wells' Office](principal_s_office.md). Max may also take two different optional photos inside the science lab and possibly change Warren's grade for his science practical.

##  Interactions 
:**PC users: **''Hover over the text to see Max's comments. [Interactions](see_here.md) for all interactions in the game.''
###  Episode Two - "Out of Time" 
*{{Interaction|Max can look at and speak to Ms. Grant.|"Ms. Grant is so cool and smart. She defines the word 'teacher'."}}
*{{Interaction|She can look at the periodic table.|"A periodic table... Wish I knew what 'periodic' means..."}}
*{{Interaction|She can look at a "Front to the Future" poster.|"I wish I could bring a mini Warren with me to my Science exams."}}
*{{Interaction|She can look at a "Art is Science" poster.|"DaVinci was a boss."}}
*{{Interaction|She can look at and touch the aquarium.|**Look: **"I bet if I touch the glass all these creepy sea critters will pop up."
**Touch: **"Or nothing will happen at all."}}
*{{Interaction|She can look at and speak to Warren.|**Before talk: **"There's Mister Wizard hard at work."
**Sodium/Potassium: **"That's a minor fail."
**Lots of potassium: **"I don't want to laugh, but he looks so hilarious..."
**Chlorine: **"Eureka! He did it!"}}
*{{Interaction|She can take an optional photo of Warren after successfully helping him with his experiment.|"That was fun helping Warren. He's pretty cute when he's in full-on geek mode..."}}
*{{Interaction|She can look at the chemistry stuff in front of Warren.|"Bring me the brain, Igor!"}}
*{{Interaction|She can look at and speak to Brooke.|"Brooke always kinda pretends like I'm almost... not there. Why?"}}
*{{Interaction|She can look at a skeleton.|"Wonder why they don't use real skeletons..."}}

###  Episode Three - "Chaos Theory" 
*{{Interaction|Max can look at and change the grade on Warren's exam file.|**Helped: **"An 'A-'? All right, all right, so Dr. Max did help Warren this morning!"
'''Didn't help: '''"Only a 'B-'? Warren has shattered my faith. Of course, I'm barely passing science."
**Change grade: **"You deserve way more than this for taking on Nathan, but every little grade counts..."
**Look afterwards: **"Yes, I like this 'plus' better then that 'minus.' Thanks for being there for me,
Warren..."}}
*{{Interaction|She can take the sugar from the table **(required)**.|"Oooh, sugar."}}
*{{Interaction|She can look at a diagram on the blackboard.|"Ass biology... ugh, gross!"}}
*{{Interaction|She can look at the periodic table.|"A periodic table... Wish I knew what 'periodic' means..."}}
*{{Interaction|She can look at a "Art is Science" poster.|"DaVinci was a boss."}}
*{{Interaction|She can look at a "Max takes shitty selfies" graffiti.|"I never said they were great, troll."}}
*{{Interaction|She can look at and take an optional photo of the fish inside the aquarium after turning on the lights.|**Look: **"Everybody's asleep... I hate to wake them up, but I want a picture."
**Turn on: **"Good evening, fish fish."
**Photo: **"Thanks fish, nice work."
**Turn off: **"Please resume your slumber."}}
*{{Interaction|She can look at a chemistry book.|"So sodium chlorate is... a weed killer? You'd think Warren would have told me that factoid."}}
*{{Interaction|She can look at the chemistry stuff inside a cupboard.|"You're an artist, dammit, not a scientist. But this is so not sodium chlorate."}}
*{{Interaction|She can look at and take the sodium chlorate from the top of the cupboard **(required)**.|**Look: **"Here's the sodium chlorate box."
**Take: **"You know you're clumsy Max, don't waste your rewind power. Use the damn chair!"}}
*{{Interaction|She can look at and take an optional photo of the smoking skeleton.|"Ew, gross. At least switch to e-cigs."}}

##  Trivia 
* The Science Lab is numbered as Room 104.
