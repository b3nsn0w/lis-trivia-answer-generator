The **Custodial Room** is located to the right of the [Prescott Dormitory](prescott_dormitory.md) entrance and is used by [Blackwell Academy](blackwell.md)'s janitor [Samuel Taylor](samuel_taylor.md).

##  Episode One - "[Episode 1: Chrysalis](chrysalis.md)" 
[Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) enters the room to crank up the sprinkler valve, which drenches [Victoria Chase](victoria_chase.md), [Taylor Christensen](taylor.md), and [Courtney Wagner](courtney_wagner.md), causing them to stand up and leave the stairs where they were sitting.

##  Episode Two - "[Episode 2: Out of Time](out_of_time.md)" 
Max has a second opportunity to explore the room; she can find photos of [Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md) posing and a box labeled "Sammy's stuff". Outside, she can ask Samuel, who sits on a bench, about the photos.
Samuel also keeps a missing person poster of Rachel Amber in his custodial room.

##  Episode Three - "[Episode 3: Chaos Theory](chaos_theory.md)" 
Max can enter the room once again as the door is not locked. Inside, she can find a scarf, a fashion magazine, a box with an empty paint bucket and several toolboxes.

##  Trivia 

Samuel's janitor room that can't be entered from the custodial room but very likely was originally meant to be an explorable area since there exists detailed concept art for the room.
