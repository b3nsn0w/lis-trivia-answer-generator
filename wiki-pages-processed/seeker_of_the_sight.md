##  Lyrics 
: Seeker of the sight
: Creature of the crime
: Feature of the flight

: Beware

: Leacher of the lie
: Breacher of the bind
: Teacher of the time
: Beware
:
: See
: How they conform
: How they swarm

: Beware
: See
: How they conform
: How they swarm
: Beware

: The meteors alight
: And it's burning up so bright
: I see it as a sign
: Beware
: Freezing out of fright
: Prisoners of the night
: Driven to the fire
: You're there
: See
: How they conform
: How they swarm

: Beware

: See
: How they conform
: How they swarm

: Beware

: See
: How they conform
: How they swarm

: Beware

: See
: How they conform
: How they swarm

: Beware...
