##  Trivia 
* The term "Chaos Theory" is a mathematical sub-discipline that studies "behaviors in dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions". The "butterfly effect" is often used within chaos theory to metaphorically describe how small things, such as the flapping of a butterfly's wings, may have large effects, such as causing a tornado elsewhere.
* If you rewind time after using the vending machine and use it again while searching through Blackwell at night, Max will make a comment about how she could get every can in the machine with just one coin.
* If you go inside a Swimming Pool locker room and then rewind, Chloe says, "Dude, it's getting old! Try and dazzle me with another trick!"
* The audio files for Episode 3, contain a file called "VO_E3_6B.STM_pck-0000000043", featuring [Officer Berry](officer_berry.md)'s voice: "Since you know so much about episode two, maybe you should tell me what's going on? I sure hope you're not proud of yourself for playing a leaked, incomplete game, and, if you do it again, next time you roll through Arcadia Bay might be your last time. Choose wisely."[File:Headphones.png](16px.md)
[File: Moved Eggs Episode Three After Patch.jpg](165x165px.md)
* With the [Limited Edition (Life is Strange)#Limited Edition Patch](patch_update.md) on January 19, 2016, the shopping bag with the eggs Max has to find for Joyce's breakfast was moved from the door to the kitchen probably due to a lot of complaints about how hard it was to find.
* The morning after the break-in at Blackwell Academy, Max will receive three text messages from Warren a few seconds after she gets up from Chloe's bed. The timestamps of these texts are: 8:13 am, 8:13 am, and 8:14 am. Max receives no further texts while she is inside Chloe's room. Once Max exits the room, she will receive a text from [Richard Marsh](richard_marsh.md) (Kate's father). This text has a timestamp of 8:10 am, which is prior to the timestamps on Warren's texts. While many modern smartphones and Apple's iMessage display the time a message was originally sent rather than the time it was received, this capability was uncommon for messages sent with SMS in the United States in 2013.https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/q-sms-time-sent-vs-received.2695980/
* The day following the school break-in, distinct rumbles of thunder can occasionally be heard if Max is out in the garden at Chloe's house, further signifying the approach of the big storm.
* The clock in the dining area of Chloe's house has real-time hand movement. The hands are positioned at approximately 8:22 am when Max heads downstairs. However, idling to run up the time to the timestamp of text messages from later scenes will not cue those messages to appear in this scene. The messages are scripted, that is, to appear once Max has reached a certain point in the game, not once a certain amount of time has passed.This was discovered by allowing Max to stand idle until the clock hands reached 9:17 am, which is the time she receives a text message from her dad. This text is only received when Max makes her way towards the entrance of the Two Whales Diner in the next chapter.) If the ''Chloe's House - Downstairs'' chapter is played at a normal pace, it is estimated that Max leaves the house with Chloe at approximately 8:50 am (as a minimum time).
* One of the dates on Chris' height chart on his father's wardrobe is "09/10/2013". When read as a European date, this is possibly a link to the third episode of the original Life is Strange, "Chaos Theory", which takes place on October 9th.
* A nightmare sequence was originally planned to occur when Max spends the night at Chloe's house, as indicated by "E3_4A Nightmare" being included in the location list found in the files.[https://tcrf.net/Life_is_Strange_(Windows,_Mac_OS_X,_Linux)/Early_Locations The Cutting Room Floor - Early Locations]
