**[Maxine Caulfield**, Max Caulfield](maxine_caulfield____max_caulfield.md) in her [Max's Diary, diary](max_s_diary__diary.md) on August 18, 2013

**Arcadia Bay** is a fictional, picturesque seaside town in Oregon, United States, and the setting of the original *[Life is Strange](life_is_strange.md)*. It reappears in the [Life is Strange: Before the Storm](prequel_game.md) and very briefly in *[Life is Strange 2](life_is_strange_2.md)*.

Arcadia Bay was originally inhabited and founded by [Native American](native_american.md)s, as mentioned by [Michelle Grant](ms__grant.md) when she speaks of the settlers living peacefully with one another after their arrival. Its main source of commerce was fishing which - according to a [R.J. MacReady](fisherman.md) - is no longer feasible due to the [Prescott Family](prescott_family.md)'s business practices.

##  Life is Strange 
In *Life is Strange*, which is set in October 2013, the town is experiencing [Meteorological Anomalies](strange_weather_and_other_phenomena.md) that is somehow linked to [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md)'s [Rewind](time_controlling_abilities.md).

A freak snow flurry and an unexpected eclipse end [Episode 1: Chrysalis](episode_1.md) and [Episode 2: Out of Time](episode_2.md), respectively. The reoccurring deaths of animals are seen throughout [Episode 3: Chaos Theory](episode_3.md), and an ominous double moon appears at the end of [Episode 4: Dark Room](episode_4.md). In [Episode 5: Polarized](episode_5.md), Arcadia Bay's fate is in the player's hands as the town can be destroyed by the [Storm](tornado.md) in Max's visions, or it can be saved by going back to the beginning of the game and allowing [Chloe Price](chloe_price.md) to get shot by [Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md).

##  Before the Storm 
In *Before the Storm*, which is set in 2010, three years before the events of *Life is Strange*, a [Forest Fire](forest_fire.md) is started by [Rachel Amber (Before the Storm)](rachel_amber.md).

##  Comics 
***Note: The events of the comic series, based on the original game, are not intended to be a true ending continuation, [https://twitter.com/Emmavieceli/status/1060208929622446080 as emphasized by the writer].***

The [Life is Strange (Comic Series)](comic_series.md), continues the Sacrifice Arcadia Bay ending. It shows Arcadia Bay has been destroyed. However, it is also revealed that the Prescotts and the Prescott Foundation have chosen to contribute money to the relief effort and rebuilding.

##  Ecosystem 
{{Main|Wildlife}}
Arcadia Bay has a rich and varied ecosystem. In regard to flora, a beautiful lush coniferous forest surrounds the town in every direction except the West, where the bay meets the Pacific Ocean. As for fauna, it ranges from [Media:Note-lighthouse-wildlife.png](bears__snakes__coyotes__wolves.md), whales, squirrels, butterflies, insects, to different types of birds and the various deer that can be seen throughout the episodes of the original game.

##  Symbolism 
[File:Etinarcadiaego.png](thumb.md)
The name "Arcadia" was deliberately chosen for the symbolism it bears. Arcadia is a utopia introduced in Greek and Latin mythology, which is full of flowers, fruits, and forests. In an interview writer, Christian Divine explained that “it just sounded more peaceful and mystic, and the word ‘Arcadia’ has all these connotations that would be fun to play with and contrast with the darkness that’s actually going on in the town. It has all these different representations and metaphors that you can look in to and work with.”

*"Even in Arcadia, there I am."*
##  Inspirations 
*In construction.*

The developers conducted research on the setting by traveling to the Pacific Northwest — particularly the Tillamook Bay area — for the purpose of conveying a nostalgic and autumnal feel to the game. The development team visited the region, took photographs, looked at local newspapers and used Google Street View to make sure the environment was accurately portrayed.[http://www.momenta.online/2016/02/edouard-caplain-on-the-art-behind-life-is-strange/ Edouard Caplain on the Art Behind Life Is Strange] (February 9, 2016)

*In early stages of development, the main reference for the town of Arcadia Bay was Astoria, a city on the hillside of Oregon, but it was way too big for the setting they were aiming for. Eventually, they found Garibaldi, a much smaller town which was working well with its main street running along the coast.
*The Arcadia Bay map layout was directly inspired by Garibaldi, OR, as evident from [http://visitgaribaldi.com/garibaldi-walking-map/ this map] provided by [http://visitgaribaldi.com/ "Visit Garibaldi"]. Several places were either directly based on their Garibaldi counterparts as shown on the map, including their locations on the map, or inspired by them.

**Barn ("Old Mill")

Garibaldi Map.jpg|Map of Garibaldi from "Visit Garibaldi".

* Arcadia Bay has been built with inspiration from multiple locations in Oregon. These probably include [wikipedia:Oceanside,_Oregon](oceanside__or.md), [wikipedia:Bay_City,_Oregon](bay_city__or.md), [wikipedia:Newport,_Oregon](newport__or.md) and [wikipedia:Lincoln_City,_Oregon](lincoln_city__or.md) on the coast. In the episode "[Episode 2: Out of Time](out_of_time.md)", [Warren Graham](warren_graham.md) notes that the [http://www.newbergoregon.gov/community/page/99w-drive-theatre Newberg drive-in] is sixty miles away from Blackwell, which matches the distance from Lincoln City.
* Several characteristic details are very likely based on the area of [wikipedia:Tillamook_Bay](tillamook_bay.md). The railroad track, water tower, and harbor can or could be found in [wikipedia:Garibaldi,_Oregon](garibaldi__or.md), while the lumber mill, as well as some signs, can be found in Tillamook, OR. The lighthouse design might be based on either Heceta Head Lighthouse or Yaquina Head Lighthouse (Newport, OR).
* [wikipedia:Oceanside,_Oregon](oceanside__or.md) is down the coast from {{Wiki|Cape_Meares_Light|Cape Meares Lighthouse}}, part of which is a line of sight to the lighthouse, from Short Beach, in the same way as the lighthouse in Arcadia Bay. The view from Cape Meares south to Oceanside is very similar to that of the view of Arcadia Bay from its lighthouse.
* There are a few streets in Arcadia Bay with real-life counterparts in the Tillamook County area. Those include Cedar Ave where Chloe lives, and Franklin Street where she was given a parking ticket.
** Cedar Ave exists in Tillamook, OR, a city located south of Garibaldi.
* The list of 146 coordinates found in [David's Files](david_s_locker.md) in Episode 4 actually are the coordinates for Tillamook Bay, although they correspond to the water itself to prevent the coordinates matching up with real locations. This is further evidence that Arcadia Bay may be based on Tillamook Bay and its surrounding areas.

Real Coordinates.jpg|Position of the fictive town of Arcadia Bay based on just one of the in-game coordinates found in [David's Files](david_s_files.md). (Google Maps Screenshot)
TX_ComputerScreen_E43C_Chloe02.png|Map seen on Chloe's laptop when she searches for the Dark Room

* It's possible that the town is meant to represent the town of [wikipedia:Bayocean,_Oregon](bayocean__or.md) which was destroyed over the course of 40 years by man-made erosion, and existed where there is now water, which could be another possible explanation for the coordinates from David's file corresponding with the water area.
* In a postcard sent to Chloe, Rachel wrote Chloe's address stating that Arcadia Bay's ZIP code is 97141 (which is the real ZIP Code of Tillamook, OR). Another postcard sent by someone called [Amaury Balandier](amaury.md) contains the same ZIP code. However, on the auto repair invoice, the shop's address in Arcadia Bay states a different ZIP Code: 97603. This is also a real ZIP code belonging to Klamath Falls, OR. And while in [Drew North](drew_north.md)'s room, area codes written on a post-it note state Arcadia Bay's ZIP code is 97103, the real code for Astoria OR.
* [File:Postcard2.png](thumb.md) Another postcard found in Chloe's room seems to have been sent from {{Wiki|Tillamook Head}}, OR. While Tillamook Bay serves as one of the main inspirations for Arcadia Bay, Tillamook Head is a high promontory well-known by hikers. It became famous in 1806 after Captain William Clark and 12 members of the Corps of Discovery hiked over the promontory where they encountered a beached whale.[http://www.oregon.com/recreation/tillamook-head History of Tillamook Head]

##  Trivia 
* The town was originally called "Aurora Creek" before [Christian Divine](christian_divine.md) suggested the name "Arcadia Bay" because "it just sounded more peaceful and mystic, and the word ‘Arcadia’ has all these connotations that would be fun to play with and contrast with the darkness that’s actually going on in the town. It has all these different representations and metaphors that you can look in to and work with."[http://onlysp.com/dungeons-dragons-life-strange-discussion-writer-christian-divine/ From ‘Dungeons & Dragons’ to ‘Life Is Strange’ – A Discussion with Writer Christian Divine]
** In the game files for the first level (the vision on the cliff), the textures for the Arcadia Bay map are called "Aurora Creek Map", a leftover of its initial name.
**The game file for the large picture of Arcadia Bay that hangs in the upstairs hallway at Chloe's house is named "TX_Post_AuroraCreek_D".
**Aurora Creek is a river located in the Pacific Northwest coast area close to places that directly inspired Arcadia Bay such as the Tillamook Bay area where Garibaldi is located, or are mentioned in the game such as Portland and Seattle.
**"Aurora" is the Latin word for dawn and the goddess of dawn in Roman mythology. In Roman mythology, Aurora renews herself every morning and flies across the sky, announcing the arrival of the sun.
* When Max goes back in time to 2008, an Oregon state map decorated with pictorial Tillamook County tourist attractions is on the wall in the kitchen.The name of the game file suggests this belongs to William. The majority of these pictures have been identified to be reflective of real-life Tillamook attractions, such as:
**The orange block - representing the cheese made at the famous Tillamook Cheese Factory.
**The bird - representing the fact that Tillamook County is said to be a bird watching paradise.http://visitgaribaldi.com/birdwatching/
**1959 with historical-looking shield emblem - 1959 is an important date for Tillamook County; this is the year that the community came together once again to construct a replica of the *Morning Star* vessel that was constructed in the mid-nineteenth century to export Tillamook dairy products and seafood. The vessel was a game-changer for Tillamook.
**Lighthouse - there are 11 lighthouses that run along the Oregon coast, two of which are located in Tillamook County: Tillamook Rock, and Cape Meares.
**Native American - Tillamook is a Chinookan word for a Tillamook place-name, possibly meaning "land of many waters" or "People of Nehalem."[http://what-when-how.com/native-americans/tillamook-native-americans-of-the-northwest-coast/]
*The Et in Arcadia ego sticker from Max's journal may be a reference to the painting [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Et_in_Arcadia_ego Et in Arcadia ego], a work by Nicolas Poussin a leading painter of the French Baroque style.
*The people living in Arcadia Bay are called "Arcadian Bayers".This is how the radio host DJ Stan Stanwick addresses his audience when listening to the [The STYR!](radio.md) in Chloe's room in *[Life is Strange: Before the Storm](before_the_storm.md)*.
* The current mayor of Arcadia Bay is presumed to be [Mayor Cochran](mayor_cochran.md).His name is mentioned on the "25th Annual Happy Halloween Bazaar" flyer located just inside the entrance of the Two Whales Diner.
* According to *[Life is Strange: Before the Storm](before_the_storm.md)*, Arcadia Bay is located inside or near the Tillamook County area, since a [Media:Jamesoffice-legalletter.png](letter.md) to [James Amber](james_amber.md) mentions the "Tillamook County Family Services".
** "Tillamook County Family Services" may be based on the "Tillamook Child Welfare Office", which is a part of the "Oregon Department of Human Services" and covers Tillamook, Clatsop, and Columbia counties.
* In *Life is Strange*, the water tower by the train tracks displays the text, "City of Arcadia Bay," but there is confusion around whether Arcadia Bay is officially a town or a city; it is referred to as both at different times. This may have been an inconsistency during development, as there are 50+ occasions of it being referred to as a town and, excluding the water tower text, only a couple of clear instances of it being referred to as a city (one of these occasions being in a newspaper article).
* Arcadia Bay could be a reference to "Arcadia" from the 1999 video game "The Longest Journey" which has a  lot of similarities to "Life Is Strange", such as both main protagonists having powers, and using what their talents are to make their power stronger. Max uses passion for photos to go back in time further, and April Ryan uses her talent of painting as a way of traveling back and forth a lot easier from Stark to Arcadia.
