On January 19th, 2016, for North America and January 22nd for Europe, the Official Soundtrack was released as a part of the [Limited Edition (Life is Strange)](limited_edition__life_is_strange_.md), featuring 14 licensed songs and 8 score tracks by Jonathan Morali.

* There is an extremely rare Vinyl version.[http://na.square-enix.com/us/blog/life-strange-vinyl-soundtrack-sweepstakes Life is Strange Vinyl Soundtrack Sweepstakes]
