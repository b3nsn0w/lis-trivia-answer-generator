> We're in the Otters' lair!" - "Big fucking deal. I want that heated water!

**[Maxine Caulfield**, Max](maxine_caulfield____max.md) and [Chloe Price, Chloe](chloe_price__chloe.md) in "[Episode 3: Chaos Theory, Chaos Theory](episode_3__chaos_theory__chaos_theory.md)"

The **Blackwell Academy Swimming Pool** is an outbuilding located on the [Blackwell Academy](blackwell.md) campus. It is an explorable location in the third episode, "[Episode 3: Chaos Theory](chaos_theory.md)", and it is the home to the swim team, the [The Otters](blackwell_otters.md). The pool's [Media:Swimming_pool_hours.png](opening_hours.md) are Monday to Friday, 6am-7am.

##  Background 
Posters around the Blackwell campus state that on Thursday night, the [Vortex Club](vortex_club.md) will be holding an [End of the World Party](_end_of_the_world__party.md) at the pool.

##  Episode Three - "[Episode 3: Chaos Theory](chaos_theory.md)" 
In this episode, [Chloe Price](chloe.md) and [Maxine Caulfield](max.md) break into the pool by stealing keys from [Raymond Wells](principal_wells.md)' secretary's office. Max can explore both locker rooms, no matter which one she chooses to enter originally. She can also change names on a list for the Vortex Club party, located at the back of the pool behind some equipment, near the back emergency exit. After turning on the lights in the coach's office, Chloe and Max take a dip in the pool together. Once finished with their midnight dip, the girls dry off and get dressed just in time to evade [David Madsen](david.md) or a security guard, who is investigating the break-in. Max and Chloe escape and take off to Chloe's house in [Chloe's Truck](her_truck.md).

##  Episode Four - "[Episode 4: Dark Room](dark_room.md)" 
The "End of the World" party, organized by the Vortex Club, takes place at the Blackwell swimming pool. Max and Chloe visit it together, looking for [Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md).

##  Rooms 
The building has male and female locker rooms, showers and toilets. There is also an office room for the Coach, displaying Otters propaganda.
### Girls' Locker Room
The girls' locker room is much cleaner than that of the boys and has less graffiti. There are three rows of lockers, one on either wall and one in the center that is double-sided. There are benches in between each row of lockers. Max can view three lockers in the girls' locker room: [Victoria Chase](victoria.md)'s, [Kate Marsh](kate.md)'s, and [Brooke Scott](brooke.md)'s. Max can also view the contents of these lockers.

Next to the entrance is a large window overlooking the pool and a table with a coffee maker, an observable coffee cup, and drawers that Max can search to find an Otters 2012 swim team poster. There is also the switch to the lights of the pool, a whiteboard showing the goals of the swim team, and practice dummies.

### Entrance
In the entrance, there are two vending machines with one for drinks and one for snacks. Doors to the office and girls' and boys' locker rooms are on either side and at the end of the small corridor. There is a bulletin board with two ads for missing and stolen items as well as one flier about climate change. One of the stolen items is a backpack containing a tablet with pictures of a late cat on it. Please view [Easter Eggs (Life is Strange)#Cat_Pics](this_article.md) for more info about the cat pics.

##  Theories
*After Nathan pulled a gun on Chloe in Episode 1, Chloe, in her panicked state, could have run to hide around the side of the swimming pool building, as there is a pile of cigarette butts in that location. The Rachel Amber Missing posters scattered along the ground outside Blackwell Academy's main entrance seem to suggest that she ran in that direction (towards the swimming pool and parking lot). Chloe would certainly have had the time to smoke a cigarette (or a few) for the time it takes Max to go to her dorm to collect the flash drive.

##  Trivia 
* The Eye of Providence is displayed in the front entrance to the pool. We can see this from Episode One - "Chrysalis". This probably foreshadows Chloe and Max being there in future episodes.
* There are also signs of Chloe being there before, due to the graffiti in the front entrance, reading the same as the scrawls in her bedroom. "Think like a man", "Just gotta let go", "I aim to misbehave" among others.
* While www.icecapped.ou is not a real website, there is a website similar in name in existence with the same goal: http://icecap.us/.
