###  '''Girls' Dormitories** 

# ###  **Max's Room'* 
*Max's alarm clock rings, and she presses snooze. She lies in bed listening to music.*

*Max gets up.*

**Max (thinking):** Being a superhero is dirty work. I need a shower.

*Max takes the shower supplies on top of the drawer next to her closet.''

**Max (thinking):** Okay, Max, let's hit the showers now!

*Max leaves her room.*

# ###  **Hallway** 
*Victoria stands in the doorway of her room talking to Courtney.*

**Victoria:** Courtney, seriously, do not forget I need those papers before tonight. Like, now. Thanks, *cherie*.

**Courtney:** Yeah, of course, Victoria. I'll get the tests and papers to you this afternoon. I am so on it. Consider it done.

*Courtney walks off and Victoria closes her door.*

*Alyssa is hit in the head with toilet paper thrown by a student in the bathroom.*

**Alyssa:** Ow!

**Optional Conversation with Alyssa**

**Max:** You okay, Alyssa?

**Alyssa:** Immature assholes... Sorry Max, I'm not feeling social right now.

*Max rewinds, then warns Alyssa.*

**Max:** Alyssa, can you stand over there?

**Alyssa:** Uh, okay, Max. If that makes you happy...

*TP is thrown but misses Alyssa.*

**Alyssa:** Wow, now that was close. Thank you, Max.

**Optional Conversation with Alyssa #2**

**Max:** Why, hello again, Alyssa.

Warned Alyssa from the football# Warned Alyssa from the football

**Alyssa:** Okay, Max, that's twice you've saved me from a projectile weapon. Are you my guardian angel?

**Max:** Hardly, I just have a sixth sense for trouble. I'm glad to help you out.

|-|Didn't warn Alyssa from the footballDidn't warn Alyssa from the football

**Alyssa:** Damn, that was quick thinking, Max.

**Max:** I'm glad my psychic skills saved you from that toilet paper beatdown.

**Alyssa:** Blackwell has a surplus of assholes. Oh by the way, Warren said you borrowed his epic film flash drive. I didn't know you were a sci-fi geek like us. What's your favorite?

"Looper"# "Looper"

**Max:** "Looper" was very cool. Seriously plays with your mind. I'm still trying to figure it out...

|-|"Back to the Future""Back to the Future"

**Max:** I love "Back to the Future," of course. But who doesn't?

**Alyssa:** Can you imagine going back in time to Blackwell in the 1980s?

**Max:** We'd suffocate from all the hair spray.

|-|"Groundhog Day"# "Groundhog Day"

**Max:** I love the idea of going back in time to fix mistakes in "Groundhog Day."

**Alyssa:** I barely want to go forward in time, much less go backward.

**Max:** I hear you. But it's all about the choices you make now.

**Alyssa:** You and Warren do know your sci-fi. Be careful, you might make Brooke jealous...

**Max:** I'll just pretend I have no idea what you mean.

**Conversation between Juliet and Brooke**

*Juliet shows a video on her phone to Brooke.*

**Juliet:** Gross. The Vortex Club are such pigs. I'm glad I pissed them off.

**Brooke:** I didn't think Kate was like this… macking on those bros? Ew.

**Juliet:** We shouldn't be watching this.

**Brooke:** Everybody's seen it by now.

*A moment later, Max is able to have conversations with Juliet and Brooke.*

**Optional Conversation with Juliet**

''Juliet is in the hallway until Max takes a shower. After Max takes a shower, Juliet can be found in Dana's room. This conversation can take place in either location.''

**Max:** Hello, Juliet.

**Juliet:** Hey, Max, did you check out Kate's hot video yet?

Why?Why?**Max:** Why should I?

**Juliet:** Because it's fucking hilarious. "Church Girl Gone Wild."

|-|That's not cool.# That's not cool.**Max:** That's so not cool.

**Juliet:** I didn't get wasted on camera and get busy with the Vortex Club.

**Max:** Kate's not like that and you know it.

**Juliet:** Really? Check her out and tell me what she's like.

**Max:** Do you believe everything you see? Like Zachary sexting Dana?

**Juliet:** Touche. Now I feel like an ass. Thanks for finding out the truth yesterday.

What about Victoria?What about Victoria?**Max:** What did you do about Victoria pulling that crap?

**Juliet:** Nothing...yet. My mind works in devious ways too.

|-|Are you sure?# Are you sure?**Max:** Are you sure? I thought you'd be pissed...

**Juliet:** Not at you. Part of me was almost disappointed, because I built up so much rage.

|-|What about Zachary?What about Zachary?**Max:** What about Zachary? Did you let him off the hook?

**Juliet:** When he acts like a worm, I let him dangle.

**Max:** Glad to see you're back in action.

**Juliet:** You have a good heart, Max... And I won't watch Kate's video anymore. Or pass it on.

**Max:** That's the spirit! Thanks, Juliet.

**Juliet:** Sure, talk to you later.

*If Max tries to talk to Juliet again*

**Juliet:** I'm not watching the video, Max.

**Juliet:** Excuse me, I'm texting Zach.

**Optional Conversation with Brooke**

**Max:** Hey, Brooke.

**Brooke:** Oh, hi, Max.

Did you see the snow?# Did you see the snow?**Max:** Did you see the freak snowfall yesterday?

|-|You look distracted.You look distracted.**Max:** You look distracted. Everything cool?

**Brooke:** I was riveted by that weird snow flurry yesterday.

**Max:** I can't tell if you're being serious or not... Um, since I'm a science noob, I was wondering if you could explain it...

**Brooke:** I'm serious. Even meteorologists can't explain that snow. I bet Warren can. Did you talk to him yet?

I will later.# I will later.**Max:** I will later.

**Brooke:** Lucky you. I'm sure he'll track you down, Max. I'll see you around.

|-|No.No.**Max:** No, not at all. He's my friend, not my mother.

**Brooke:** True. And Warren really loves to talk meteorology with me, since I'm one of the few who can talk back. Talk to you later, Max.

*If Max tries to talk to Brooke again*

**Brooke:** I don't have time, Max. I can't talk now.

**Brooke:** Really, Max?

# ###  **Showers** 
*Max enters the shower room. Kate is seen facing a mirror, brushing her teeth.*

**Conversation with Kate**

**Kate:** Max!

**Max:** Oh! Uh... Hey, Kate. Sorry about yesterday.

**Kate:** Yeah, I'm sorry you didn't do anything to help. But you're just like everybody else here...

**Max:** That's not true, I wanted to help, but, but--

**Kate:** Whatever, it's done...

|-|Intervened# Intervened

**Kate:** Hey Max!
}}

**Max:** Hey, Kate. How are you doing?

**Kate:** I'm here. Thanks again for standing up for me yesterday. I needed that.

**Max:** Anytime. That guy has issues.

**Kate:** Doesn't everybody here?

**Kate:** By the way, Max, do you still have my copy of "The October Country"?

**Max:** Oh. Yes, of course. It's great so far. I didn't realize Bradbury was such a poet.

**Kate:** Can you please bring it back to my room this morning? I just need to take some notes for class.

**Max:** Absolutely. I'll bring it by later.

*Max begins to take a shower.*

*Victoria and Taylor enter and approach Kate.*

**Victoria:** What's up, Kate?

**Kate:** School.

**Taylor:** That's it?

**Victoria:** That video of you clubbing didn't look like homework...

**Kate:** Victoria, that wasn't me...

**Taylor:** Oh, my God. Right.

**Victoria:** Don't be shy. I think it's awesome you set a tongue record on video...

*Taylor laughs.*

**Kate:** You're going to be sorry someday.

*Kate leaves.*

**Victoria:** Oh, boohoo, I'm sorry you're a viral slut. I'm sure she had fun.

**Taylor:** Looks like it.

**Victoria:** I know Nathan hooked her up. And you know he has the good shit.

**Taylor:** Preach it, sista.

*Victoria examines herself in the mirror.*

**Victoria:** Yuck. I still have goddamn paint all over my face.

Made fun of Victoria# Made fun of Victoria**Victoria:** "Max Selfie" thought she was a badass taking that picture. I shoulda beat her down.

**Taylor:** That was so uncool.

**Victoria:** She's jealous because Mark--Mr. Jefferson knows I'm going to win the "Everyday Heroes" contest. He thinks Max is a joke.

|-|Comforted VictoriaComforted Victoria**Victoria:** Good thing my faithful minions took their sweet time bringing me a towel...

**Taylor:** We ran all the way--

**Victoria:** Give it a rest, Taylor. Now I know if I'm in an accident I won't rely on you or Courtney for help. You can hang out with Kate...or Max.

**Taylor:** She's a weirdo with that dumb camera.

**Victoria:** I hate that "I'm so quirky" crap. Anyway. Let's leave the link to Kate's video so everybody gets a chance to see her in action...

**Taylor:** You are such an evil beeatch. I love it!

*Victoria pull out a tube of lipstick and writes the link to the video of Kate on the mirror.*

*Taylor laughs, then she and Victoria leave.*

*Max puts her PJs back on and steps out of the shower.*

**Max (thinking):** I better get dressed, then go give back Kate's book.

*Optional: Max washes her face at the sink.*

**Unknown female student (from inside the shower):** Hello?! Water!

**Max:** Sorry, I forgot!

*Optional: Erase the link written on the mirror.*

**Max (thinking):** Even if I can stop one person from watching it, it's worth it.

''Max leaves the bathroom and returns to her own room (if Max left Victoria's photos in the rearranged state, Max's slate will say "LOOK AT ME: I AM MAX SELFIE!" and show a drawing with a photo of a turd. Max can erase this and draw a new picture on her slate).*

# ###  *'Max's Room'* 
Reported Nathan and/or made fun of Victoria# Reported Nathan and/or made fun of Victoria

*Max's room will be vandalized if she did either of the above.''

**Max (thinking):** No fucking way! This is not why I came to Blackwell. And I still have to clean all this crap up? After I find Kate's book...

''Reported Nathan: "NOBODY MESSES WITH ME BITCH" will be written in red letters over Max's selfie wall. There will also be a defaced photo of Max on her bed.*

*Made fun of Victoria: "CRAPPY ARTIST FILTHY WHORE" will be written on Max's mirror and the photo of Victoria covered in paint will be stolen.*

*In both instances some of Max's stuff will be scattered near her bed.*

*Max can clean up her room by:*
* *Putting away the defaced photo of herself (only if she reported Nathan)*
* *Tidying up the mess near her bed''
**Max (thinking):** Ta da! I do love a clean room. Very zen. Except for that bullshit graffiti.

|-|Didn't report Nathan or make fun of VictoriaDidn't report Nathan or make fun of Victoria

''Max's room will be untouched.*

*Max gets dressed at her closet.''

**Max (thinking):** Maybe I'll just put on a shirt and jeans. Hey, Einstein had the same exact suit for every day of the week. And he couldn't even rewind time.

''Optional: Max searches for Kate's book in the clutter on her couch.*

**Max (thinking):** No book here...

*Optional: Max searches for Kate's book in the clutter at her desk.''

**Max (thinking):** My desk is a pigsty, but...I know it ain't there.

''Optional: Max searches for Kate's book in the clutter on the floor.*

**Max (thinking):** And nothing here.

*Max searches the clutter on the end table next to the couch. She lifts up a piece of paper and finds the book, but accidentally spills a cup of soda all over it.''

**Max (thinking):** Of course you just spilled soda on Kate's book. Better fix this fast. Kate needs the book and I don't want to add to her list of problems.

*Max rewinds, then moves the cup.*

**Max (thinking):** Begone, foul soft drink!

*Max takes the book.*

**Max (thinking):** Aha, you sneaky book, you're mine! Now I can finally take this back to Kate before I'm late. As if I have to worry about being late anymore... I do have all the time in the world now.

*Max leaves her room.*

''Kate's slate will have insults written on it. Max can erase them.*

*Max knocks on Kate's door.''

**Max:** Kate? You in there?

**Kate (from inside her room):** Yes, I'm here. Come in, Max...

# ###  '''Kate's Room'* 
*Max enters and explores Kate's room. She then talks to Kate.''

**Conversation with Kate**

**Max:** Uh, hey, Kate, I brought your book...

Took photo# Took photo**Kate:** Max, why didn't you do anything when David harassed me yesterday?

{{#tag:tabber|I wanted proof.I wanted proof.**Max:** I wanted proof David was in your face.

**Kate:** I thought he was different. I'm happy to see that somebody cares...

{{!}}-{{!}}I was scared.# I was scared.**Max:** I'm sorry. I was scared. I can be pretty gutless.

**Kate:** I don't expect you to get in trouble for me. I just feel like nobody cares...

|-|IntervenedIntervened**Kate:** Max, why did you step in between David and me yesterday?

{{#tag:tabber|I hate bullies.# I hate bullies.**Max:** I hate bullies. David Madsen should know better.

**Kate:** I was hoping he would. But it's nice to see that you care about me...

{{!}}-{{!}}I had no choice.I had no choice.**Max:** I had no choice. David Madsen is an asshole.

**Kate:** You had the choice to not get involved. Nobody here seems to care about anybody...

}}

**Max:** Kate, I actually do care. So, what's the story with you and David?

**Kate:** Well... He's a total paranoid ass! He thinks I'm part of the Vortex Club. Yeah, right.

Did you party with them?# Did you party with them?**Max:** Did you party with them?

**Kate:** I went to a Vortex Club party against my better judgment. Not my scene at all.

|-|What about the video?What about the video?**Max:** What about this video? And I swear I haven't watched it.

**Kate:** I can't even watch it, Max...

{{#tag:tabber|Should I watch it?# Should I watch it?**Max:** Should I watch it? Just for...posterity?

**Kate:** Are you kidding?

{{!}}-{{!}}I won't.I won't.**Max:** I won't either.

**Kate:** Thank you, Max.

}}

|-|Why?# Why?**Max:** Why does he think that?

**Kate:** Because he saw the video.

**Kate:** Do you know how humiliating this is for me?

**Max:** I know this sucks, Kate, but...tell me about the video and maybe I can help.

**Kate:** Basically, I went to one Vortex Club party and ended up making out with a bunch of people...and I have no memory of it...

Why would you go?Why would you go?**Max:** So, why would you go?

**Kate:** Lapse of sanity? I just thought I could meet some new people.

|-|Doesn't sound like you.# Doesn't sound like you.**Max:** Doesn't sound like you. I can't see you partying with Victoria...

**Kate:** I didn't.

|-|That's awful...That's awful...**Max:** That's awful. So, how did that happen?

**Kate:** It's a long story. I'm still trying to sort it all out...

**Max:** You have to tell me more than that. What happened at the party? Did you drink?

**Kate:** I swear to God I had one sip of red wine. And then I drank water.

Are you sure?# Are you sure?**Max:** Are you sure it was just one sip?

|-|Not enough to get wasted.Not enough to get wasted.**Max:** Not enough to get wasted, is it?

**Kate:** I don't get wasted. Ever.

**Kate:** I take a sip at church and I don't end up on a viral video, okay?

**Max:** Did somebody drug you?

**Kate:** I remember...I remember getting sick and dizzy...

**Max:** Go on...

**Kate:** Then Nathan Prescott said he would take me to the hospital...

Did you go?# Did you go?**Max:** Did you go?

**Kate:** Definitely not. I'm not sure where I went...

**Max:** What do you remember about that?

|-|Nathan Prescott!Nathan Prescott!**Max:** Nathan Prescott? Oh, shit!

**Kate:** He was being nice for a change when he offered to help me.

**Max:** He's the opposite of nice. What next?

|-|How sick were you?# How sick were you?**Max:** How sick were you?

**Kate:** Sick enough to need a doctor. I thought I was dying, Max.

**Max:** So, Nathan didn't take you to the ER?

**Kate:** All I recall is driving for a long time...then I woke up in a room...I thought it was a hospital because it was so white and bright...

**Max:** Go on, I'm listening.

**Kate:** Somebody was talking to me in a soft voice...I thought it was a doctor...until I heard Nathan and felt a sharp sting in my neck...and...and...

And?And?**Max:** And?

|-|Are you sure?# Are you sure?**Max:** Are you sure?

**Kate:** Of course--you think I'm making this crap up? Why?

**Max:** No, I'm just...being deductive. As usual. Then what happened?

**Kate:** That's all I remember! I don't know what happened... I woke up outside my dorm room the next day. I didn't have any marks or bruises, but I felt gross.

**Max:** So, who took the video of you at the party?

**Kate:** I have no idea. Probably Victoria. She was there being her mean self.

**Max:** Jesus, Kate, I'm sorry. This is serious shit.

**Kate:** How do I get a viral video taken down? I know it's already spreading--what if my church sees that? I need to know what to do...

**Max:** Kate, we'll figure it out. I'll check back later, okay?

**Kate:** Thanks, Max... You can put my book here, near my bag.

''Max places the book next to Kate's bag.''

**Kate:** So, Max, can I ask you a question? And please be honest.

**Max:** Absolutely, Kate. Anything.

**Kate:** I need to find out if Nathan Prescott helped me...or hurt me after that party. Should I go to the police?

GO TO THE POLICEGO TO THE POLICE**Max:** Yes, you should definitely go to the police, Kate. I totally believe every word you say. Nathan Prescott is truly dangerous.

**Kate:** Bless you, Max. I will go to the police...and also Principal Wells. With you as my back-up witness, they'll have to take us seriously now.

**Max:** Back-up witness? Well, I mean, I believe you and everything, but...we're still just spoiled punk students to the cops and faculty... I just think we need to be very careful here...

**Kate:** Why? Careful of what?

**Max:** Nothing...except the Prescotts are a powerful family. I hope this won't backfire on us, that's all. Even though that rich bastard has earned some serious bad karma. He'll get it...

**Max (thinking):** Time out, Max. You actually told Kate to go to the police and the Principal...after getting a scary text threat. Now the police will definitely drag you into this shit.

|-|LOOK FOR PROOF# LOOK FOR PROOF**Max:** If you do that, they won't believe you. You're on video grabbing at all those guys and they'll use that against you. Bad.

**Kate:** But I know I was drugged--

**Max:** That's what you have to prove. Not them. I'm just telling you how the cops and school will look at this. The video doesn't exactly back you up...

**Kate:** You make me feel so hopeless--

**Max:** No, no, Kate. I just don't want you to get hurt any more...

**Kate:** That seems impossible at this point. So that's your answer?

**Max:** I think we should wait. There are other things going on that might help you.

**Kate:** But not right now. So I can walk down the halls with people calling me a viral slut. Thanks, Max.

**Max (thinking):** Good job, Dr. Max. She didn't like what I had to say, but we need more proof of what happened.

''Max leaves Kate's room.*

*Optional: Max enters Dana's room.*

###  *'Dana's Room'* # 
*If Max enters Dana's room while Dana is dancing on her bed, Stella can be heard through the wall complaining about the loud music.*

**Dana:** No Max, I don't hate you. Not that I don't like juicy gossip... I just wish you weren't so nosey.

**Max:** It's like my fatal character flaw.

**Dana:** Or a gift. You're very good at being nosey.

**Max:** Because I care.

**Dana:** I would laugh, but you did save me yesterday. So let's call it even.

**Dana:** You're almost psychic. I felt like you knew everything anyway...

**Dana:** By the way, the best and biggest news of the day is that Trevor asked me to the Halloween shindig.

**Max:** That's awesome, Dana.

**Dana:** At least we're showing our faces together in public... So you absolutely should go with us. Borrow one of my outfits and come as a cute geek couple with your bitch Warren...

**Max:** Err, I'm not big on cosplay.

**Dana:** Don't let life pass you by, Max. So, are you coming to the party or not?

Why not.# Why not?
**Max:** Why the fuck not? If I hate it, I can always go back...to my room.

**Dana:** That's the spirit, Max! After this, you'll be ready for a rave...

**Max:** It does sound like fun. Now I have to go contemplate my party future...

|-|No.No.
**Max:** No, sorry. It's just...not my thing.

**Dana:** You came to Blackwell to discover yourself, not hide in your dorm.

**Max:** I won't discover myself avoiding projectile vomit from bro-dudes. Thanks anyway.

Yes.Yes.**Max:** Yes, that's exactly what I need. I love those old-school ape films.

**Warren:** Well, that was easier than I thought. Cool. I'll text you the info.

*Max leaves the Dormitories. She walks across the Main Campus and notices David Madsen and Nathan Prescott arguing.*

**Max (thinking):** David talking to Nathan cannot be a good thing. This has something to do with Kate...or Rachel...

*Max takes a seat on the school bus and begins to listen to music with her earphones. She stares out the window as the streets of Arcadia Bay fly past.*

*The bus stops in front of the Two Whales Diner and Max gets off.*

'''Woman and Old Guy's Conversation**

**Old Guy:''' Yep. I'm ready to cash my lottery ticket.

I just got off.I just got off.**Max:** I just got off the school bus, but I'm sure the regular bus is coming too.

|-|I don't know.# I don't know.**Max:** I don't know... It runs pretty regularly.

**Woman:** I cannot miss this job interview. But I've got to take the bus out of Arcadia Bay to Newport just to find work.

**Max:** Are things that bad here?

**Woman:** Where are things good? I can't even afford to live here.

**Max:** Well, good luck!

**Woman:** Thanks, I sure need it!

**Optional Conversation with Old Guy**

**Old Guy:** No time for chitchat. I'm a millionaire, yep. Got my lottery ticket right here. Waiting for the bus so I can cash it in.

|-|How long have you lived here?# How long have you lived here?**Max:** How long have you lived here?

{{!}}-{{!}}What happened?What happened?**Max:** What happened to you?

**Chloe:** Are you afraid of getting in trouble? Oh, boohoo, Max is afraid! I know you can handle this. And I'm here to guide you. Make me proud, sista!

|-|If Max re-winded back If Max re-winded back

**Chloe:** Are you ready to do this?

**Max:** We should jet, before-

**Chloe:** We have plenty of time to do anything we want, whenever we want! Make me proud, sista.

*Chloe gives the gun to Max. Frank approaches, and Max quickly hides the gun behind her back.*

**Frank:** Hey, it's Thelma and Louise. Or is it Bonnie and Clyde?

**Chloe:** Excuse us, Frank.

**Frank:** Oh, sorry, Chloe. Don't let me get in the way of your bonding. I heard the gunshots and the breaking glass. It's cute that you're playing with guns. Just like me at your age.

**Chloe:** We're not anything alike, man.

**Frank:** We both need money. In fact, you need it so bad you owe me a shitload, don't ya, Chloe? Huh?

**Chloe:** You'll get your money.

**Frank:** Don't they all say that? Y'know, even when they're broke and acting tough...

*Frank looks at Max.*

**Frank:** What're you hiding there, girlie? Let me see!

*Frank points at Max and Chloe notices the bracelet on his wrist.*

**Chloe:** Where did you get that bracelet?

**Frank:** A friend. And it's none of your goddamn business. You're my business now and I--

**Chloe:** That's Rachel's bracelet! Why the fuck are you wearing her bracelet?!

**Frank:** Calm yourself, alright? It was a gift.

**Chloe:** No, it wasn't! You stole that shit! Give it to me right now, asshole!

*Chloe reaches for the bracelet. Frank pulls out a knife.*

**Frank:** You better step back before you regret it, girl. I mean it. You want me to cut you, bitch?

*Frank and Chloe look over at Max, who is pointing the gun at Frank.*

**Max:** Please...please step back.

**Frank:** You're kidding. Put that down.

SHOOT# SHOOT*Max pulls the trigger, but the gun is out of bullets.*

**Frank:** That is hilarious! Oh, man... I'll remember you, kid. I'll remember you almost shot me. And you'll wish I had no memory, because I never forget. You have until Friday to pay me. Don't ever pull crap like this again. It'll be the last time you do. Try bullets next time, brainiacs.

*Frank puts the knife back in his pocket and leaves.*

**Max:** Sorry.

*Chloe hugs Max.*

**Chloe:** You were awesome. Thanks for standing up for me...Let's blow. My secret lair didn't feel secret today. At least Frank is gone; he won't fuck with us again. He just wants his money.

**Max (thinking):** ''Jesus, I almost shot this guy and now he'll be more dangerous to Chloe and me.''

|-|DON'T SHOOTDON'T SHOOT**Frank:** Come on, girlie. Shoot me.

''Frank walks toward Max, who looks around uncertainly. Frank takes the gun out of Max's hands.''

**Frank:** Oh, Christ. You're more like Abbott and Costello. Nice piece. I'll consider this interest on your loan. Thanks. You have until Friday to pay me. Or I'll track you down with this interest. Have a good play, kids.

*Frank waves the gun tauntingly and leaves.*

**Chloe:** You really stood your ground.

**Max:** I freaked. I don't like guns.

**Chloe:** It'll be hard to keep Nathan off my ass... My step-shit will have his other guns sealed in an electrified bunker by now.

**Max:** Sorry, Chloe. I've never held a gun on a human being before. Not cool.

**Chloe:** I know, Max. Really. I'm actually relieved it worked out this way instead... And there are more guns out there...Let's blow. My secret lair didn't feel secret today. At least Frank is gone; he won't fuck with us again. He just wants his money.

**Max (thinking):** ''Oh, man, Frank took Chloe's gun because of me...*

**Max (thinking):** *Wowser, why did Frank have Rachel's bracelet? We need to talk about this later, but I better follow Chloe now. Chloe is waiting to go for a walk. We both need a time-out from here.*

*Max and Chloe leave the junkyard.''

**Max:** It felt awful... I'm glad there was no bullets in there--

**Chloe:** You can just rewind time in your hand and stick that barrel right up Frank's ass! You have the power!

**Max:** You're gross. Don't fall.

*Max and Chloe briefly hold hands, then let go.*

|-|Didn't try to shoot FrankDidn't try to shoot Frank**Chloe:** I can't believe you basically gave him my gun. "Here ya go, Frank."

**Max:** You can't keep getting mad at me. Especially for stupid shit.

**Chloe:** I'm not mad. It adds up in my mind as people letting me down. And I just liked having that gun, man.

*Max and Chloe briefly hold hands, then let go.*

**Max:** Now you have me to protect you.

**Chloe:** I'm just glad you were here.

**Max:** Me too...I think. Chloe, why the hell are you hanging around scary losers like Frank? It's weird.

**Chloe:** Let's take a break and I'll talk.

*Max and Chloe lie down on the train tracks.*

**Chloe:** Feels like a different world, huh? I wish we could stay forever...

**Max:** Can we build another pirate fort and keep the world out?

**Chloe:** We need a new secret hangout... At least Frank wouldn't find us... Are you okay, Max?

I'm freaked out.# I'm freaked out.**Max:** I'm still freaked out about what happened... That was awful, Chloe.

|-|Frank?Frank?**Max:** Seriously, Chloe, this is scary. What if Frank tries to track us down?

**Chloe:** I'm sorry. But Frank isn't as hardcore as he fronts. All he cares about is his cash, stash, and mangy dog.

|-|Didn't try to shoot FrankDidn't try to shoot Frank**Max:** Chloe, are you for reals? Frank just took your gun and threatened us! He's armed and clearly dangerous.

**Chloe:** Max, I know. Crazy shit is the new normal for me. That's why I planned to leave Arcadia Bay without paying Frank off...

**Max:** Now, tell me exactly what's going on between you and Frank--does he have a last name?

Stayed hidden# Stayed hidden**Chloe:** Frank Bowers. Obviously don't get my pot from you, remember? Anyway, Frank and I kind of hung out.

|-|Took the blameTook the blame**Chloe:** Frank Bowers. He's just a dealer. Where I get my weed. The one in your joint, remember? Anyway, Frank and I kind of hung out.

Hung out?# Hung out?**Max:** Hung out? You don't mean you...

**Chloe:** No, we didn't have sex. Gross, man. He never even tried. I just made the mistake of borrowing money so Rachel and I could bail outta here...

|-|Bad boy?Bad boy?**Max:** Is this your "bad boy" phase?

**Chloe:** No, it's my "trying to scrounge some quick cash so Rachel and I could get the hell out of here" phase. Frank had quick cash. That's all.

**Max:** That's it?

**Chloe:** No. I want to know how Frank got Rachel's bracelet... What do you think?

Be careful.# Be careful.**Max:** I think we have to be careful. And keep an eye on this guy. Without him eyeballing us, okay?

|-|My brain is fried.My brain is fried.**Max:** I don't know anymore. My brain is so fried from all this. I need a mental enema.

**Chloe:** It's so weird talking to you about this insane crap. We haven't hung out this much since we were tweens...and it's like no time has passed. I wish Rachel was here to meet you.

Rachel and I?# Rachel and I?**Max:** Do you think that Rachel and I would have been friends?

|-|Why?Why?**Max:** Why? I bet she would hate me.

**Chloe:** You're not that different. She had--has a great eye for images and for art. Plus, she's a smartass like you. We would all be hella best friends forever.

**Max:** I know she must be as cool as you are. I have no doubt we'll meet soon.

**Chloe:** Railroad tracks always make me feel better...I have no idea why...

**Max:** Kerouac knew. It's the romance of travel and movement...the sound of the train whistle at night...

**Chloe:** Look at the beat poet here.

**Max:** I'd rather be a good photographer...

**Chloe:** You are. You just have to stop being afraid...

*Max gets up to take a picture of the mid-morning sun framed by the structure of a nearby water tower.*

**Max (thinking):** Perfect...

*Max holds her head in her hand as the flashing visions of the tornado return. The vision ends with Chloe calling for help.*

**Chloe:** Max! 

*We see Max holding her head in pain as she comes out of the vision to discover Chloe is actually calling for help.*

**Chloe:** Max? Help! I'm stuck!

**Max:** Hold on, Chloe!

''Max grabs Chloe's hands and tries to pull her up from the tracks but it doesn't work. She tries to free Chloe's boot, but it is caught in the track switch, which had moved at some point during the vision. Max hears a train horn in the distance.''

**Max (thinking):** What's that noise? The train...oh, shit!

'''Chloe's comments while trapped**

**Chloe:** Come on, Max! Hurry!

**Chloe:** Please get me outta here!

**Chloe:** Max!

**Chloe:** The train is coming! Max, please!

**Chloe:'* Please!

*The train gets to the point where the person at the controls sees Chloe, and activates the emergency brakes. The steel-on-steel grinding grows louder as the train approaches.* 

**Chloe:** Please…

**Chloe:** PLEASE!!!

*Max is forced to rewind as the train reaches Chloe or Max (if Max is on the track between Chloe and the train).*

**Max (thinking):** Damn, I missed something. I better rewind!

*If Max tries to speak to Chloe''

**Chloe:** Get me outta here Max!

**Chloe:** Find something! Free me!

**Chloe:** I don't wanna die here!

*There are two ways Max can free Chloe.*

*Max can take the crowbar and use it on the wedge blocking the cable drum, then push the drum down the embankment. This moves the switch and frees Chloe, but will damage the train tracks. Max will also need to return to Chloe to lift her out.*

*Max can take the crowbar, open the equipment shed door with it, take the pliers, and use them to cut the red wire in the fuse box. This unlocks the switching lever, which Max can then pull, freeing Chloe.*

*Max takes the crowbar.*

**Max (thinking):** I can definitely use this bad boy!

*Max can use the crowbar to remove the wedge holding the cable drum in place.*

**Max (thinking):** Now I can finally move the drum.

*Max can push the cable drum.*

*Chloe drives Max to the entrance of Blackwell. The weather has begun to get rainy.*

**Max:** Thanks for the ride, Chloe. Right on time for my art lesson.

**Chloe:** Thanks for coming with me. Sorry to be so boring...

**Max:** Nothing exciting ever happens to us, right?

**Chloe:** Listen, your rewind power has to be connected to that snow yesterday. That might explain your tornado vision...

|-|I doubt it...# I doubt it...**Max:** I don't see how. It's so friggin' random...

**Chloe:** No, "crazy shit happens." Because it can. And will.

**Chloe:** A perfect example of "strange attractors." Don't they teach you kids anything at Blackwell? We have a tornado, rewind power, and freak snow...hello, Armageddon! So let's party with your power, rock star!

**Max:** Like you said, Professor Price: a superhero needs a sidekick.

**Chloe:** How can it be such a shitty week and yet one of the best of my life?

**Jefferson:** She's modest. Like a real hero.

**David:** Yeah. "Real hero."

|-|Didn't save Kate# Didn't save Kate*Officer Berry is also present in the room. He stands near the window.*

**Principal Wells:** I know this isn't pleasant for any of us, but we have to go over what happened before Miss Marsh...before she did what she did. Officer Berry will be taking notes for the official police inquiry. I'm sure you'll give him your full cooperation. Such a tragedy...but there must be a reason for everything. We need to find out why Kate Marsh would be driven to such desperate action.

**Principal Wells:** As principal of Blackwell Academy, I take my duties seriously. I take the well-being of every student more seriously. What happened today should never happen in a hall of wisdom and knowledge. Mr. Madsen, as our head of security here, those roof doors should always be locked. That's just standard operating procedure. They were not. And that is indeed your responsibility. Mr. Jefferson, I know you can't be expected to know what your students are going through, but Kate has assisted you in class, so you should've known something was amiss. Mr. Prescott, since you are responsible for the Vortex Club parties, and since Miss Marsh did attend your last party, you'll have to answer some more questions. Miss Caulfield, why exactly were you on the roof with Kate Marsh? Did she tell you her plan? Or anything at all? Please, tell us everything.

NATHAN DOSED HERNATHAN DOSED HER**Max:** All I know is that Kate was at a party and Nathan dosed her. She got wasted and kissed some boys on a viral video without a clue.

**Max:** You're a liar. You told Kate you took her to the emergency room!

**Nathan:** I said I was going to take her to the ER. She sobered up eventually.

**Max:** Bullshit! Something happened to her, and you know it. How about we talk about you waving a gun in the girls' bathroom—

**Max:** Excuse me, I was there! I saw you getting in her face!

**David:** You have no idea what you saw. Kate Marsh was involved with a bad crowd. I was trying to find out who...

**Nathan:** Kate had a double life. I was super shocked when I found out.

**Principal Wells:** Well now, this is problematic. The publicity is rising and perhaps... you shouldn't represent Blackwell at the "Everyday Heroes" contest in San Francisco...

**Jefferson:** Are you serious?

**Principal Wells:** I am. We don't need any negative press about that event. And we need to involve the Academy in possible disciplinarian measures for you.

*Max and Warren sit together on the Main Campus at sunset.*

**Warren:** Max, that was the greatest thing I've ever seen! Ever! You reached out, she reached out...hugs, tears, applause! Like a superhero!

**Max:** Not quite. Look at me, I'm a mess.

**Warren:** You're glowing. Seriously! A human halo. I'm pretty sure you earned your wings today.

**Max:** I'm still worried about Kate. She did try to kill herself. All over a video...

**Warren:** "Viral" is the right word. Like a disease.

**Max:** So, you watched it?

**Warren:** Just one...and a half times...

|-|Couldn't save Kate# Couldn't save Kate**Max:** I just...can't believe it. It's like it wasn't even real...watching her drop like a weight... I really thought I could save her...like a superhero...

**Warren:** Come on, Max. Do not for a second blame yourself. Kate was on that roof for her reasons, not yours.

**Max:** My hand just reached out...

**Warren:** Stop it. You were the only one with balls enough to run to the roof. You were the only one who cared.

**Max:** Yeah, I sure made a big fucking difference. Maybe if more people cared...better people than me...

**Warren:** You're the best person around...

**Max:** Warren, I screwed up today.

**Warren:** That makes no logical sense.

**Max:** Warren, I don't mean to sound weird, but there's something ominous going on at Blackwell...

**Warren:** Today proves that.

**Max:** And I'm working on proof that Kate Marsh is connected to Rachel Amber...somehow. Along with Nathan and Mr. Madsen.

**Warren:** I'm not a big conspiracy guy, but I wouldn't doubt it. Nathan did scare me yesterday and Madsen is a straight-up dickhead. So...what do you think is really happening?

**Max:** What the hell is this...?

*Max and Warren look at the sky, where the setting sun is suddenly eclipsed.*

**Max:** The weather confirms this weird day... Feel that chill...

**Warren:** Max, there was no eclipse scheduled today... I would know. I would.

*Max rubs her arms, feeling cold. Warren moves closer and wraps his arms around her.*

**Max:** I believe you, Warren... I'll believe anything this week...

###  **Epilogue** 
*David and Joyce hold hands in the backyard of their house, talking. Joyce hugs David.*

*Principal Wells argues with Jefferson in his car. Jefferson drives away.*

*Victoria is crying on her bed, her face buried in her hands. Nathan opens the door.*

*Frank sits on a rock at the beach, petting his dog next to him.*

''Chloe sits alone on the bench at the lighthouse cliff. She's smoking and holding her cellphone in her hand, waiting for Max to reply to her messages.''

**Chloe (SMS):** Sorry about Kate. I hope you're ok.

**Chloe (SMS):** This eclipse freaks me out...

**Max (SMS):** Let's find out what's going on!

**Max (SMS):** Together!

*A row of red binders are shown. The binders have various female names written on them. The last one in the row says "RACHEL." Another binder, labeled "KATE," lies on a table. Next to it is a photograph of Kate on a piece of paper with writing all over it. Other than the name "Kate Marsh," the writing on this paper is illegible. A pen, X-ACTO knife, tube of glue, two containers of prescription pills, and a half-full glass of alcohol are also placed on the table.*

**Max (thinking):** Okay, Max, let's hit the showers now!

*Max leaves her room.*

**Victoria:** Courtney, seriously, do not forget I need those papers before tonight. Like, now. Thanks, *cherie*.

**Courtney:** Yeah, of course, Victoria. I'll get the tests and papers to you this afternoon. I am so on it. Consider it done.

*Courtney walks off and Victoria closes her door.*

*Alyssa is hit in the head with toilet paper thrown by a student in the bathroom.*

**Alyssa:** Ow!

**Optional Conversation with Alyssa**

**Max:** You okay, Alyssa?

**Alyssa:** Immature assholes... Sorry Max, I'm not feeling social right now.

*Max rewinds, then warns Alyssa.*

**Max:** Alyssa, can you stand over there?

**Alyssa:** Uh, okay, Max. If that makes you happy...

*TP is thrown but misses Alyssa.*

**Alyssa:** Wow, now that was close. Thank you, Max.

**Optional Conversation with Alyssa #2**

**Max:** Why, hello again, Alyssa.

Warned Alyssa from the footballWarned Alyssa from the football

**Alyssa:** Okay, Max, that's twice you've saved me from a projectile weapon. Are you my guardian angel?

**Max:** Hardly, I just have a sixth sense for trouble. I'm glad to help you out.

|-|Didn't warn Alyssa from the football# Didn't warn Alyssa from the football

**Alyssa:** Damn, that was quick thinking, Max.

**Max:** I'm glad my psychic skills saved you from that toilet paper beatdown.

**Alyssa:** Blackwell has a surplus of assholes. Oh by the way, Warren said you borrowed his epic film flash drive. I didn't know you were a sci-fi geek like us. What's your favorite?

"Looper""Looper"

**Max:** "Looper" was very cool. Seriously plays with your mind. I'm still trying to figure it out...

|-|"Back to the Future"# "Back to the Future"

**Max:** I love "Back to the Future," of course. But who doesn't?

**Alyssa:** Can you imagine going back in time to Blackwell in the 1980s?

**Max:** We'd suffocate from all the hair spray.

|-|"Groundhog Day""Groundhog Day"

**Max:** I love the idea of going back in time to fix mistakes in "Groundhog Day."

**Alyssa:** I barely want to go forward in time, much less go backward.

**Max:** I hear you. But it's all about the choices you make now.

**Alyssa:** You and Warren do know your sci-fi. Be careful, you might make Brooke jealous...

**Max:** I'll just pretend I have no idea what you mean.

**Conversation between Juliet and Brooke**

*Juliet shows a video on her phone to Brooke.*

**Juliet:** Gross. The Vortex Club are such pigs. I'm glad I pissed them off.

**Brooke:** I didn't think Kate was like this… macking on those bros? Ew.

**Juliet:** We shouldn't be watching this.

**Brooke:** Everybody's seen it by now.

*A moment later, Max is able to have conversations with Juliet and Brooke.*

**Optional Conversation with Juliet**

''Juliet is in the hallway until Max takes a shower. After Max takes a shower, Juliet can be found in Dana's room. This conversation can take place in either location.''

**Max:** Hello, Juliet.

**Juliet:** Hey, Max, did you check out Kate's hot video yet?

Why?# Why?**Max:** Why should I?

**Juliet:** Because it's fucking hilarious. "Church Girl Gone Wild."

|-|That's not cool.That's not cool.**Max:** That's so not cool.

**Juliet:** I didn't get wasted on camera and get busy with the Vortex Club.

**Max:** Kate's not like that and you know it.

**Juliet:** Really? Check her out and tell me what she's like.

**Max:** Do you believe everything you see? Like Zachary sexting Dana?

**Juliet:** Touche. Now I feel like an ass. Thanks for finding out the truth yesterday.

What about Victoria?# What about Victoria?**Max:** What did you do about Victoria pulling that crap?

**Juliet:** Nothing...yet. My mind works in devious ways too.

|-|Are you sure?Are you sure?**Max:** Are you sure? I thought you'd be pissed...

**Juliet:** Not at you. Part of me was almost disappointed, because I built up so much rage.

|-|What about Zachary?# What about Zachary?**Max:** What about Zachary? Did you let him off the hook?

**Juliet:** When he acts like a worm, I let him dangle.

**Max:** Glad to see you're back in action.

**Juliet:** You have a good heart, Max... And I won't watch Kate's video anymore. Or pass it on.

**Max:** That's the spirit! Thanks, Juliet.

**Juliet:** Sure, talk to you later.

*If Max tries to talk to Juliet again*

**Juliet:** I'm not watching the video, Max.

**Juliet:** Excuse me, I'm texting Zach.

**Max:** Hey, Brooke.

**Brooke:** Oh, hi, Max.

|-|You look distracted.# You look distracted.**Max:** You look distracted. Everything cool?

**Brooke:** I was riveted by that weird snow flurry yesterday.

**Max:** I can't tell if you're being serious or not... Um, since I'm a science noob, I was wondering if you could explain it...

**Brooke:** I'm serious. Even meteorologists can't explain that snow. I bet Warren can. Did you talk to him yet?

I will later.I will later.**Max:** I will later.

**Brooke:** Lucky you. I'm sure he'll track you down, Max. I'll see you around.

|-|No.# No.**Max:** No, not at all. He's my friend, not my mother.

**Brooke:** True. And Warren really loves to talk meteorology with me, since I'm one of the few who can talk back. Talk to you later, Max.

*If Max tries to talk to Brooke again*

**Brooke:** I don't have time, Max. I can't talk now.

**Brooke:** Really, Max?

**Kate:** By the way, Max, do you still have my copy of "The October Country"?

**Max:** Oh. Yes, of course. It's great so far. I didn't realize Bradbury was such a poet.

**Kate:** Can you please bring it back to my room this morning? I just need to take some notes for class.

**Max:** So, who took the video of you at the party?

**Kate:** Thanks, Max... You can put my book here, near my bag.

**Kate:** So, Max, can I ask you a question? And please be honest.

**Kate:** I need to find out if Nathan Prescott helped me...or hurt me after that party. Should I go to the police?

**Kate:** Bless you, Max. I will go to the police...and also Principal Wells. With you as my back-up witness, they'll have to take us seriously now.

**Max:** Back-up witness? Well, I mean, I believe you and everything, but...we're still just spoiled punk students to the cops and faculty... I just think we need to be very careful here...

**Kate:** Why? Careful of what?

**Max:** Nothing...except the Prescotts are a powerful family. I hope this won't backfire on us, that's all. Even though that rich bastard has earned some serious bad karma. He'll get it...

**Max (thinking):** Time out, Max. You actually told Kate to go to the police and the Principal...after getting a scary text threat. Now the police will definitely drag you into this shit.

|-|LOOK FOR PROOFLOOK FOR PROOF**Max:** If you do that, they won't believe you. You're on video grabbing at all those guys and they'll use that against you. Bad.

**Kate:** But I know I was drugged--

**Max:** That's what you have to prove. Not them. I'm just telling you how the cops and school will look at this. The video doesn't exactly back you up...

**Kate:** You make me feel so hopeless--

**Max:** No, no, Kate. I just don't want you to get hurt any more...

**Kate:** That seems impossible at this point. So that's your answer?

**Max:** I think we should wait. There are other things going on that might help you.

**Kate:** But not right now. So I can walk down the halls with people calling me a viral slut. Thanks, Max.

**Max (thinking):** Good job, Dr. Max. She didn't like what I had to say, but we need more proof of what happened.

**Max:** Err, I'm not big on cosplay.

**Dana:** Don't let life pass you by, Max. So, are you coming to the party or not?

Why not.Why not?
**Max:** Why the fuck not? If I hate it, I can always go back...to my room.

**Dana:** That's the spirit, Max! After this, you'll be ready for a rave...

**Max:** It does sound like fun. Now I have to go contemplate my party future...

*Max leaves the Dormitories. She walks across the Main Campus and notices David Madsen and Nathan Prescott arguing.*

**Max (thinking):** David talking to Nathan cannot be a good thing. This has something to do with Kate...or Rachel...

**Woman:** Thanks, I sure need it!

**Joyce:** It surprised me fierce.

**Joyce:** I was hoping you could be a good influence in her life now...

**Max:** I will be. Promise. I know things were hard for you and Chloe. I feel bad I didn't call. Now my folks are in Seattle and I'm all alone at Blackwell. It's my karma.

**Joyce:** You did the right thing. You moved forward with your life. I did, after William passed on. Chloe...Chloe chose to stay angry... Anyway, I hope we see more of you. Chloe needs an old friend again.

**Chloe:** Amen! And while you build an empire, I'm there to keep you on the path of badassness. And fun.

|-|No way.No way.**Max:** No way. I still don't even know how my power works or for how long...

**Chloe:** Dude, you fuck shit up, you rewind, you fix it. Drop the mic. Boom.

**Max:** Spin, rinse and repeat... I'm just altering time and space. Oh yeah, and history. No biggie.

**Chloe:** You already altered history by saving my life, smartass. Let's see what else you can do...

''Max goes to collect bottles. They can be collected in any order. If Max hasn't found a particular bottle, she can give the player a hint as to where it can be found.*

Bottle 1# Bottle 1Location Hint
**Max (thinking):** Where to find bottles... maybe in an old refrigerator...

*Max walks to the area across from Chloe with a washing machine, empty crate, and rusty boat. Max attempts to take the bottle from on top of an old refrigerator, but it breaks.*

**Max (thinking):** Stupid bottle!

*Max rewinds, moves the crate, then takes the bottle.''

|-|Bottle 2Bottle 2Location Hint
**Max (thinking):** I know there's a bonfire spot where people party around here...

*Max attempts to leave the area. She rewinds when the debris falls, then leaves.*

|-|Bottle 3# Bottle 3Location Hint
**Max (thinking):** Where there's a boat, there's a pirate... which means booze bottles.

*Max goes up a path near Chloe that leads up a hill. Max moves a plank at the edge of the hill.*

**Max (thinking):** Way heavier than I thought...oof!

*Max walks on the plank to the boat and takes the bottle on a makeshift table.*

|-|Bottle 4Bottle 4Location Hint

*Max sees the spirit doe.*

**Max (thinking):** Wowser, that looks exactly like the same doe from my tornado vision... That doe is the perfect photo op...

*Max enters the hideout shed*

**Max (thinking):** This looks like a graffiti museum for Chloe and Rachel... I bet I can find out more about Rachel here...

''Optional: In the shed, Max writes "Max was here" beneath Chloe's and Rachel's names.''

**Max (thinking):** Now we're officially a trio...we just have to find Rachel.

*Max returns to Chloe and gives her the bottles.*

**Chloe:** Thanks, Max.

*Chloe places the bottles on the shooting range.*

**Chloe:** Wait--one more for the road.

*Chloe takes a sip of beer from the bottle in her hand before placing it on the range with the others.*

**Max:** You're serious about this...

**Chloe:** We're going to shoot all these bottles without wasting a single bullet. Max, you have to help me aim. Show me the way, Max.

**Max:** I need to see you shoot first.

*Chloe fires the gun and misses. Max rewinds.*

**Chloe:** Show me the way, Max.

Left.Left.**Max:** Aim a bit to your left.

**Chloe:** I'm on it.

*Chloe fires the gun and misses.*

**Chloe:** Lame!

*Max rewinds.*

|-|Up.# Up.**Max:** Aim slightly above.

**Chloe:** Right between the eyes...

**Chloe:** Give me something to shoot, Max.

''If Max hasn't yet chosen''

**Chloe:** Hello, what should I shoot?

RimRim**Max:** Let's take out this wheel rim on your left.

**Chloe:** Taking out the wheel rim now...

*Chloe shoots the wheel rim. The bullet ricochets off it and hits the third bottle.*

**Chloe:** Hella yes!

**Max:** Nice shootin', Tex.

**Chloe:** Now that's what I'm talking about!

**Max:** Satisfied?

**Chloe:** Like, never. So I want one more ubercool trick shot...

|-|Blue Plank# Blue Plank**Max:** Aim at that old blue plank here.

**Chloe:** I hate old planks.

*Chloe shoots the plank. It falls over, scaring a flock of birds into the air.*

**Chloe:** Yawn... I must rid the world of those bottles!

*Max is forced to rewind.*

|-|BarrelBarrel**Max:** Let's see you take a crack at that rusty barrel.

**Chloe:** Sorry, Mr. Barrel, your time has come.

*Chloe fires the gun and the bullet ricochets several times.*

**Chloe:** Listen to those phat bullet beats!

*Max is forced to rewind.*

|-|Monitor# Monitor**Max:** I bet you want to blow apart those old computer monitors.

**Chloe:** Let's reboot them with a bullet!

*Chloe fires the gun and it breaks the screen of the computer.*

**Chloe:** Old school... Lame!

*Max is forced to rewind.*

|-|No ChoiceNo Choice*If Max waits too long, Chloe decides to shoot the barrel.*

**Chloe:** Fine, since you won't play, I'm going to shoot this barrel. Yawn.

*Chloe fires the gun and the bullet ricochets several times.*

**Chloe:** Listen to those phat bullet beats!

*Max is forced to rewind.*

**Max:** How about using that junker for a target now?

''If Max hasn't yet chosen*

**Chloe:** Dude, I need a target before I shoot.

**Chloe:** Well, Max?

Bumper# Bumper**Max:** Put a real dent in that front bumper.

**Chloe:** Goodbye, cruel bumper...

*Chloe shoots the gun, but the bullet ricochets off the bumper and strikes Chloe in the chest.*

**Chloe:** Jesus, I shot myself! I shot myself! Back up, back up!

**Max:** Stupid gun! Hold on, Chloe!

*Max is forced to rewind.*

|-|WindshieldWindshield**Max:** I want to see that windshield go down.

**Chloe:** Watch out for flying glass!

*Chloe shoots and destroys the windshield. A squirrel jumps onto the car.*

**Chloe:** You guys better run for cover. Yet the bottle remains...

*Max is forced to rewind.''

**Max:** I should rewind and help Chloe hit those bottles.

|-|Gas Tank# Gas Tank**Max:** Let's see what happens when you shoot the gas tank.

**Chloe:** Step back, gas tank go boom!

*Chloe shoots the gun. A few flames rise up from the gas tank, and then it explodes.*

**Chloe:** Boom! Car definitely down, but no bottle casualties. Feels good, but I didn't hit any of the bottles.

*Max is forced to rewind.*

|-|TireTire**Mas:** How about aiming for the left tire?

**Chloe:** Adios, spinning wheel of death...

*Chloe fires the gun. The car falls onto the shooting range, crushing the remaining bottles and landing upside down.*

**Chloe:** Ubercool.

*Max and Chloe high-five.*

|-|No Choice# No Choice*If Max waits too long, Chloe decides to shoot the bumper.*

**Chloe:** Okay, you're too busy to help so I'm going to kill the car bumper.

*Chloe shoots the gun, but the bullet ricochets off the bumper and hits Chloe.*

**Chloe:** Jesus, I shot myself! I shot myself! Back up, back up!

**Max:** Stupid gun! Hold on, Chloe!

*Max is forced to rewind.*

**Chloe:** I cannot believe this is for reals! My best friend is a superhero! Now it's your turn to bust a cap.

**Max:** I don't know...

''Max's nose begins to bleed.''

**Chloe:** Max, your nose. Damn...

**Max:** I...don't...feel so super...

''Max collapses in Chloe's arms.*

**Chloe:** Max!

*Visions of the tornado flash through Max's mind.*

*Max and Chloe sit on the hood of a rusty car. Max's head rests on Chloe's lap as Chloe holds her. Max slowly wakes up, slightly disoriented.*

**Chloe:** You freaked me out there. Do you feel any better now?

**Max:** A little. Thanks for helping me, just...give me a minute.

**Chloe:** Too much action for Arcadia?

**Max:** Maybe not enough. This is kinda fun. Scary and stupid, but fun.

**Chloe:** Let me know when you feel okay.

**Max (thinking):** *God, this power really messes with my head. Glad I feel normal again. I better go chat up Chloe.''

Prior to rewindPrior to rewind

**Chloe:** Okay, looks like you're ready to lock and load.

**Max:** I don't know about this...

**Chloe:** Are you afraid of getting in trouble? Oh, boohoo, Max is afraid! I know you can handle this. And I'm here to guide you. Make me proud, sista!

|-|If Max re-winded back # If Max re-winded back

**Chloe:** Are you ready to do this?

**Max:** We should jet, before-

**Chloe:** We have plenty of time to do anything we want, whenever we want! Make me proud, sista.

*Chloe gives the gun to Max. Frank approaches, and Max quickly hides the gun behind her back.*

**Frank:** Hey, it's Thelma and Louise. Or is it Bonnie and Clyde?

**Chloe:** Excuse us, Frank.

**Frank:** Oh, sorry, Chloe. Don't let me get in the way of your bonding. I heard the gunshots and the breaking glass. It's cute that you're playing with guns. Just like me at your age.

**Chloe:** We're not anything alike, man.

**Frank:** We both need money. In fact, you need it so bad you owe me a shitload, don't ya, Chloe? Huh?

**Chloe:** You'll get your money.

**Frank:** Don't they all say that? Y'know, even when they're broke and acting tough...

*Frank looks at Max.*

**Frank:** What're you hiding there, girlie? Let me see!

*Frank points at Max and Chloe notices the bracelet on his wrist.*

**Chloe:** Where did you get that bracelet?

**Frank:** A friend. And it's none of your goddamn business. You're my business now and I--

**Chloe:** That's Rachel's bracelet! Why the fuck are you wearing her bracelet?!

**Frank:** Calm yourself, alright? It was a gift.

**Chloe:** No, it wasn't! You stole that shit! Give it to me right now, asshole!

*Chloe reaches for the bracelet. Frank pulls out a knife.*

**Frank:** You better step back before you regret it, girl. I mean it. You want me to cut you, bitch?

*Frank and Chloe look over at Max, who is pointing the gun at Frank.*

**Max:** Please...please step back.

**Frank:** You're kidding. Put that down.

SHOOTSHOOT*Max pulls the trigger, but the gun is out of bullets.*

**Frank:** That is hilarious! Oh, man... I'll remember you, kid. I'll remember you almost shot me. And you'll wish I had no memory, because I never forget. You have until Friday to pay me. Don't ever pull crap like this again. It'll be the last time you do. Try bullets next time, brainiacs.

*Frank puts the knife back in his pocket and leaves.*

**Max:** Sorry.

*Chloe hugs Max.*

**Chloe:** You were awesome. Thanks for standing up for me...Let's blow. My secret lair didn't feel secret today. At least Frank is gone; he won't fuck with us again. He just wants his money.

**Max (thinking):** ''Jesus, I almost shot this guy and now he'll be more dangerous to Chloe and me.''

|-|DON'T SHOOT# DON'T SHOOT**Frank:** Come on, girlie. Shoot me.

''Frank walks toward Max, who looks around uncertainly. Frank takes the gun out of Max's hands.''

**Frank:** Oh, Christ. You're more like Abbott and Costello. Nice piece. I'll consider this interest on your loan. Thanks. You have until Friday to pay me. Or I'll track you down with this interest. Have a good play, kids.

*Frank waves the gun tauntingly and leaves.*

**Chloe:** You really stood your ground.

**Max:** I freaked. I don't like guns.

**Chloe:** It'll be hard to keep Nathan off my ass... My step-shit will have his other guns sealed in an electrified bunker by now.

**Max:** Sorry, Chloe. I've never held a gun on a human being before. Not cool.

**Chloe:** I know, Max. Really. I'm actually relieved it worked out this way instead... And there are more guns out there...Let's blow. My secret lair didn't feel secret today. At least Frank is gone; he won't fuck with us again. He just wants his money.

**Max (thinking):** ''Oh, man, Frank took Chloe's gun because of me...*

**Max (thinking):** *Wowser, why did Frank have Rachel's bracelet? We need to talk about this later, but I better follow Chloe now. Chloe is waiting to go for a walk. We both need a time-out from here.*

*Max and Chloe leave the junkyard.''

###  **Railroad** 
Tried to shoot FrankTried to shoot Frank**Chloe:** I still can't believe you pulled a gun on Frank. That was epic.

**Max:** It felt awful... I'm glad there was no bullets in there--

**Chloe:** You can just rewind time in your hand and stick that barrel right up Frank's ass! You have the power!

**Max:** You're gross. Don't fall.

*Max and Chloe briefly hold hands, then let go.*

|-|Didn't try to shoot Frank# Didn't try to shoot Frank**Chloe:** I can't believe you basically gave him my gun. "Here ya go, Frank."

**Max:** You can't keep getting mad at me. Especially for stupid shit.

**Chloe:** I'm not mad. It adds up in my mind as people letting me down. And I just liked having that gun, man.

*Max and Chloe briefly hold hands, then let go.*

**Max:** Now you have me to protect you.

**Chloe:** I'm just glad you were here.

**Max:** Me too...I think. Chloe, why the hell are you hanging around scary losers like Frank? It's weird.

**Chloe:** Let's take a break and I'll talk.

*Max and Chloe lie down on the train tracks.*

**Chloe:** Feels like a different world, huh? I wish we could stay forever...

**Max:** Can we build another pirate fort and keep the world out?

**Chloe:** We need a new secret hangout... At least Frank wouldn't find us... Are you okay, Max?

I'm freaked out.I'm freaked out.**Max:** I'm still freaked out about what happened... That was awful, Chloe.

|-|Frank?# Frank?**Max:** Seriously, Chloe, this is scary. What if Frank tries to track us down?

**Chloe:** I'm sorry. But Frank isn't as hardcore as he fronts. All he cares about is his cash, stash, and mangy dog.

Tried to shoot FrankTried to shoot Frank**Max:** Chloe, did you see what just happened? I almost shot him! I know I could rewind, but, Chloe, this is not playtime. No more guns.

|-|Didn't try to shoot Frank# Didn't try to shoot Frank**Max:** Chloe, are you for reals? Frank just took your gun and threatened us! He's armed and clearly dangerous.

**Chloe:** Max, I know. Crazy shit is the new normal for me. That's why I planned to leave Arcadia Bay without paying Frank off...

**Max:** Now, tell me exactly what's going on between you and Frank--does he have a last name?

Stayed hiddenStayed hidden**Chloe:** Frank Bowers. Obviously don't get my pot from you, remember? Anyway, Frank and I kind of hung out.

|-|Took the blame# Took the blame**Chloe:** Frank Bowers. He's just a dealer. Where I get my weed. The one in your joint, remember? Anyway, Frank and I kind of hung out.

Hung out?Hung out?**Max:** Hung out? You don't mean you...

**Chloe:** No, we didn't have sex. Gross, man. He never even tried. I just made the mistake of borrowing money so Rachel and I could bail outta here...

|-|Bad boy?# Bad boy?**Max:** Is this your "bad boy" phase?

**Chloe:** No, it's my "trying to scrounge some quick cash so Rachel and I could get the hell out of here" phase. Frank had quick cash. That's all.

**Max:** That's it?

**Chloe:** No. I want to know how Frank got Rachel's bracelet... What do you think?

Be careful.Be careful.**Max:** I think we have to be careful. And keep an eye on this guy. Without him eyeballing us, okay?

|-|My brain is fried.# My brain is fried.**Max:** I don't know anymore. My brain is so fried from all this. I need a mental enema.

**Chloe:** It's so weird talking to you about this insane crap. We haven't hung out this much since we were tweens...and it's like no time has passed. I wish Rachel was here to meet you.

Rachel and I?Rachel and I?**Max:** Do you think that Rachel and I would have been friends?

|-|Why?# Why?**Max:** Why? I bet she would hate me.

**Chloe:** You're not that different. She had--has a great eye for images and for art. Plus, she's a smartass like you. We would all be hella best friends forever.

**Max:** I know she must be as cool as you are. I have no doubt we'll meet soon.

**Chloe:** Railroad tracks always make me feel better...I have no idea why...

**Max:** Kerouac knew. It's the romance of travel and movement...the sound of the train whistle at night...

**Chloe:** Look at the beat poet here.

**Max:** I'd rather be a good photographer...

**Chloe:** You are. You just have to stop being afraid...

*Max gets up to take a picture of the mid-morning sun framed by the structure of a nearby water tower.*

**Max (thinking):** Perfect...

*Max holds her head in her hand as the flashing visions of the tornado return. The vision ends with Chloe calling for help.*

**Chloe:** Max! 

*We see Max holding her head in pain as she comes out of the vision to discover Chloe is actually calling for help.*

**Chloe:** Max? Help! I'm stuck!

**Max:** Hold on, Chloe!

''Max grabs Chloe's hands and tries to pull her up from the tracks but it doesn't work. She tries to free Chloe's boot, but it is caught in the track switch, which had moved at some point during the vision. Max hears a train horn in the distance.''

**Max (thinking):** What's that noise? The train...oh, shit!

'''Chloe's comments while trapped**

**Chloe:** Come on, Max! Hurry!

**Chloe:** Please get me outta here!

**Chloe:** Max!

**Chloe:** The train is coming! Max, please!

**Chloe:'* Please!

*The train gets to the point where the person at the controls sees Chloe, and activates the emergency brakes. The steel-on-steel grinding grows louder as the train approaches.* 

**Chloe:** Please…

**Chloe:** PLEASE!!!

*Max is forced to rewind as the train reaches Chloe or Max (if Max is on the track between Chloe and the train).*

**Max (thinking):** Damn, I missed something. I better rewind!

*If Max tries to speak to Chloe''

**Chloe:** Get me outta here Max!

**Chloe:** Find something! Free me!

**Chloe:** I don't wanna die here!

*There are two ways Max can free Chloe.*

*Max can take the crowbar and use it on the wedge blocking the cable drum, then push the drum down the embankment. This moves the switch and frees Chloe, but will damage the train tracks. Max will also need to return to Chloe to lift her out.*

*Max can take the crowbar, open the equipment shed door with it, take the pliers, and use them to cut the red wire in the fuse box. This unlocks the switching lever, which Max can then pull, freeing Chloe.*

*Max takes the crowbar.*

**Max (thinking):** I can definitely use this bad boy!

*Max can use the crowbar to remove the wedge holding the cable drum in place.*

**Max (thinking):** Now I can finally move the drum.

*Max can push the cable drum.*

**Max (thinking):** Damn, something is blocking the drum.

*If Max has the ax, the player is given the option to use it on Chloe.*

**Max (thinking):** I don't want to use this ax… Good Lord, Max, she's not a zombie, find another way!

*Max can open the fuse box.*

**Max (thinking):** Awesome, it's not locked!

*Max can use the tools she acquired on the wires in the fuse box.*

**Chloe:** Since you're the mysterious superhero, I'll be your faithful chauffeur and companion.

**Max:** My powers might not last, Chloe...

**Chloe:** That's okay—we will. Forever.

###  **Main Campus - Before Class** 

*Chloe drives Max to the entrance of Blackwell. The weather has begun to get rainy.*

**Max:** Thanks for the ride, Chloe. Right on time for my art lesson.

**Chloe:** Thanks for coming with me. Sorry to be so boring...

**Max:** Nothing exciting ever happens to us, right?

**Chloe:** Listen, your rewind power has to be connected to that snow yesterday. That might explain your tornado vision...

Explain what?# Explain what?**Max:** Explain what? Snow equals a ginormous twister that takes out Arcadia Bay? You're high.

|-|I doubt it...I doubt it...**Max:** I don't see how. It's so friggin' random...

**Chloe:** No, "crazy shit happens." Because it can. And will.

**Max:** Why me? I'm just a geek girl in some small town...

**Chloe:** A perfect example of "strange attractors." Don't they teach you kids anything at Blackwell? We have a tornado, rewind power, and freak snow...hello, Armageddon! So let's party with your power, rock star!

**Max:** Like you said, Professor Price: a superhero needs a sidekick.

**Chloe:** How can it be such a shitty week and yet one of the best of my life?

**Max:** Because we're back in action again!

*Max sits down at her desk. She looks out the window and notices Kate walking along the path with David close by, hiding behind a tree and taking photos of her.*

**Max (thinking):** *Okay, why is David taking photos of Kate? Now, this is so wrong. And weird...*

''Warren enters the classroom and sits down on the edge of Max's desk.''

**Warren:** What up, Max?

**Max:** Hey, Warren!

**Warren:** I saw Kate earlier and her eyes were puffy from crying.

**Max:** Kate has a lot on her plate...

**Warren:** I didn't know what to say, and she didn't tell me anything...

*The class bell rings and Jefferson enters.*

**Jefferson:** Okay, I know you love me, but if you're not in this class, beat it. Everybody else, please sit down.

**Warren:** Maybe I'll see you later?

*Warren and Nathan leave as the other students take their seats.*

**Jefferson:** We have a lot to cover today, and so little time, as usual. I see all the usual suspects here... Anybody seen Kate Marsh?

**Victoria:** I think everybody has seen Kate Marsh by now.

*Taylor laughs.*

**Alyssa:** She's...not feeling good.

**Jefferson:** Sounds like you're giggling about a video gone viral. Maybe it involves a student or a friend. I wonder how it would feel to have false images of yourself shot out all over the world for people to judge...

*Max receives a text from Chloe.*

(If player uses the on-screen prompt to check the message)(If player uses the on-screen prompt to check the message)''In the Original Edition, the phone's display is shown on-screen for a split second before Jefferson interrupts. In the Remastered Edition, Jefferson catches Max looking at her phone once the player leaves the text message UI.*

**Jefferson:** No smartphones in class, Max! Put that away.

*After Max puts her phone away, Jefferson continues his lecture from the point it was interrupted.''

**Jefferson:** Usually people need something to judge so they never take a good look at themselves. We can thank reality TV for some of that. In the end, we can only blame ourselves for participating... Speaking of participation, there are a few souls here who have yet to enter a photo in the contest. Like Max Caulfield, for example. Who I know can't wait to enter, right? I'm sure you read the syllabus like it was a Harry Potter book, so you must know today we're studying chiaroscuro; that beautiful word about the contrast between light and dark, the shadowplay that gives photography such...visual power. It's basic yin and yang. Black and white images are effective precisely because of their contrast. Although we don't technically "see" in monochrome--

*Zachary bursts into the classroom.*

**Zachary:** Yo, some crazy shit is going down at the girls' dorm! Check it!

**Jefferson:** Zachary, do not come into my class like that ever again--

*All the students begin to leave their desks and head outside.*

**Jefferson:** Listen! Everybody remain seated--

*The students leave and the classroom is empty.*

**Jefferson:** Dismissed...

###  **Dormitories** 
*Girl shrieks in the background.*

**Evan:** Did you see that?

**Dana:** Is this for real?

**Logan:** Bitch flipped out!

**Courtney:** I didn't think she was that messed up...

**Dana:** Oh, my God!

'''Students' Comments About Kate**

**Zachary:** Who is that up there?

**Daniel:** Oh, no! Is that Kate?

**Trevor:** I hope not.

**Male Student:** Holy shit! That chick is right on the ledge!

**Dana:** If she jumps, she might not die...

**Juliet:** Yes, she will.

**Alyssa:** I cannot believe this, Brooke...

**Dana:** No! No!

**Trevor:** How long has she been up there?

**Evan:** Long enough.

**Dana:''' Don't! Come down! Get down!

**Brooke:** Poor Kate. That fucking viral video.

**Daniel:** Man, this is so not why I came to Blackwell!

*If Max sees Kate on the roof before she jumps.*

**Max: **Kate! No! Oh, God, I have to do something to help her!

*Kate jumps off the roof.*

**Max (thinking): **''She can't die. She can't!*

*Max rewinds, but she gets an intense headache and her nose begins to bleed.*

**Max (thinking):** *Not again...not now...*

*Kate jumps off the roof again.*

**Max (thinking):** *I have to try something...I won't be able to rewind again and again...*

*As Max rewinds again, suddenly everything stops. Everyone and everything but Max is frozen in time.*

**Max (thinking):** *Keep...going...Max... You...can...do it...*

*Max walks toward the dormitory building and heads up to the roof.*

###  **Dormitory Roof** 
*Max arrives at the roof.*

**Max (thinking):** *Yes...*

*Everything returns to normal speed as time unfreezes. Max attempts to rewind, but groans in pain as she finds she cannot. Hearing Max, Kate turns around to face her.*

**Kate:** What are you doing here, Max?

*Max attempts to rewind again but fails.''

**Kate:** Stop! Don't come near me!

**Max (thinking):** ''Not now... It won't work... I don't have any power... Now I have to do this by myself...?*

###  '''Principal's Office'* 
*The scene opens on Principal Wells standing behind his desk, facing the window. Once he starts speaking, he turns to face the others in the room. Max is seated in front of the desk, facing Principal Wells. To her left stands Mr. Jefferson. Nathan is seated to her right. To Nathan's right stands David Madsen.''

Saved Kate# Saved Kate**Principal Wells:** Now, I know today was difficult for everybody, but I'm so proud of the way Blackwell pulled together to save a young girl's life. Of course, you're quite the hero for getting Kate to come down, Max.

**Max:** I didn't do much...

**Jefferson:** She's modest. Like a real hero.

**David:** Yeah. "Real hero."

|-|Didn't save KateDidn't save Kate*Officer Berry is also present in the room. He stands near the window.*

**Principal Wells:** I know this isn't pleasant for any of us, but we have to go over what happened before Miss Marsh...before she did what she did. Officer Berry will be taking notes for the official police inquiry. I'm sure you'll give him your full cooperation. Such a tragedy...but there must be a reason for everything. We need to find out why Kate Marsh would be driven to such desperate action.

**Principal Wells:** As principal of Blackwell Academy, I take my duties seriously. I take the well-being of every student more seriously. What happened today should never happen in a hall of wisdom and knowledge. Mr. Madsen, as our head of security here, those roof doors should always be locked. That's just standard operating procedure. They were not. And that is indeed your responsibility. Mr. Jefferson, I know you can't be expected to know what your students are going through, but Kate has assisted you in class, so you should've known something was amiss. Mr. Prescott, since you are responsible for the Vortex Club parties, and since Miss Marsh did attend your last party, you'll have to answer some more questions. Miss Caulfield, why exactly were you on the roof with Kate Marsh? Did she tell you her plan? Or anything at all? Please, tell us everything.

NATHAN DOSED HER# NATHAN DOSED HER**Max:** All I know is that Kate was at a party and Nathan dosed her. She got wasted and kissed some boys on a viral video without a clue.

**Nathan:** I dosed her? Without a clue? Have you seen the video? Whatever. Kate was loaded and playing the field—

**Max:** You're a liar. You told Kate you took her to the emergency room!

**Nathan:** I said I was going to take her to the ER. She sobered up eventually.

**Max:** Bullshit! Something happened to her, and you know it. How about we talk about you waving a gun in the girls' bathroom—

**Nathan:** Hey, that's total slander! I could sue you and this school so fast!...I already have a personal lawyer.

{{#tag:tabber|Reported NathanReported Nathan**Principal Wells:** Careful, Mr. Prescott. I have been told of this alleged gun incident. And I have to admit that the video in question was sent to me by multiple sources.

**David:** Including me.

**Principal Wells:** And since Mr Prescott does appear prominently in the video and was responsible for the party, I have no choice but to suspend him until further notice.

**Nathan:** Whatever. See you in court.

**David:** Oh, grow up...

**Max:** Excuse me, I was there! I saw you getting in her face!

**David:** You have no idea what you saw. Kate Marsh was involved with a bad crowd. I was trying to find out who...

**Nathan:** Kate had a double life. I was super shocked when I found out.

**Max:** No, you were part of the crowd. And like I said, I personally saw David physically harass Kate Marsh.

**Principal Wells:** Well now, this is problematic. The publicity is rising and perhaps... you shouldn't represent Blackwell at the "Everyday Heroes" contest in San Francisco...

**Jefferson:** Are you serious?

**Principal Wells:** I am. We don't need any negative press about that event. And we need to involve the Academy in possible disciplinarian measures for you.

**Max:** Not quite. Look at me, I'm a mess.

**Warren:** You're glowing. Seriously! A human halo. I'm pretty sure you earned your wings today.

**Max:** I'm still worried about Kate. She did try to kill herself. All over a video...

**Warren:** "Viral" is the right word. Like a disease.

**Max:** So, you watched it?

**Warren:** Just one...and a half times...

|-|Couldn't save KateCouldn't save Kate**Max:** I just...can't believe it. It's like it wasn't even real...watching her drop like a weight... I really thought I could save her...like a superhero...

**Warren:** Come on, Max. Do not for a second blame yourself. Kate was on that roof for her reasons, not yours.

**Max:** My hand just reached out...

**Warren:** Stop it. You were the only one with balls enough to run to the roof. You were the only one who cared.

**Max:** Yeah, I sure made a big fucking difference. Maybe if more people cared...better people than me...

**Warren:** You're the best person around...

**Max:** Warren, I screwed up today.

**Warren:** That makes no logical sense.

**Max:** Warren, I don't mean to sound weird, but there's something ominous going on at Blackwell...

**Warren:** Today proves that.

**Max:** And I'm working on proof that Kate Marsh is connected to Rachel Amber...somehow. Along with Nathan and Mr. Madsen.

**Warren:** I'm not a big conspiracy guy, but I wouldn't doubt it. Nathan did scare me yesterday and Madsen is a straight-up dickhead. So...what do you think is really happening?

**Max:** What the hell is this...?

*Max and Warren look at the sky, where the setting sun is suddenly eclipsed.*

**Max:** The weather confirms this weird day... Feel that chill...

**Warren:** Max, there was no eclipse scheduled today... I would know. I would.

*Max rubs her arms, feeling cold. Warren moves closer and wraps his arms around her.*

**Max:** I believe you, Warren... I'll believe anything this week...

###  **Epilogue** 
*David and Joyce hold hands in the backyard of their house, talking. Joyce hugs David.*

*Principal Wells argues with Jefferson in his car. Jefferson drives away.*

*A row of red binders are shown. The binders have various female names written on them. The last one in the row says "RACHEL." Another binder, labeled "KATE," lies on a table. Next to it is a photograph of Kate on a piece of paper with writing all over it. Other than the name "Kate Marsh," the writing on this paper is illegible. A pen, X-ACTO knife, tube of glue, two containers of prescription pills, and a half-full glass of alcohol are also placed on the table.*
