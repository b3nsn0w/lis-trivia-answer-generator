'''Kate's Room''' is an explorable room in the [Prescott Dormitory](prescott_dormitory.md) at [Blackwell Academy](blackwell_academy.md) in Episode 2, "[Episode 2: Out of Time](out_of_time.md)". It is a visual representation of [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md)'s mental state. She covered her mirror up so she didn't have to look at herself and her clothes are tossed haphazardly about. It is dark and melancholic to demonstrate just how depressed Kate is.

##  Episode One - "[Episode 1: Chrysalis](chrysalis.md)" 
The room is shown in the ending cutscene. Kate is seen crying and doesn't care about the snowfall.

##  Episode Two - "[Episode 2: Out of Time](out_of_time.md)" 
[Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) visits Kate's room to return *{{Wiki|The October Country}}*, a book she had borrowed from Kate. Kate asks her if she should go to the police because of suspicions of being drugged at a [Vortex Club](vortex_club.md) party, which took place on [Vortex Club Party (October 4, 2013)](october_4.md).
