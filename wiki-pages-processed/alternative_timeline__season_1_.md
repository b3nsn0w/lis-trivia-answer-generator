##  2013 

###  At Blackwell 
Max enters the altered timeline in front of [Blackwell Academy](blackwell_academy.md). She learns that in this altered timeline she is no longer the same person. The alternative life of Max is part of the [Vortex Club](vortex_club.md), is involved with taking recreational drugs and partying, as well as being somewhat inconsiderate towards her parents. Max dresses differently, and is treated by [Victoria Chase](victoria_chase.md) as the new "Queen Bee" on campus. 

Max learns that [Warren Graham](warren_graham.md) and [Stella Hill](stella_hill.md) end up dating, and that [David Madsen](david_madsen.md) is no longer security on the campus, but becomes a bus driver for Blackwell instead.Without Joyce in his life, David's passion for justice and security were probably less supported and he ended up taking on a simpler job with a routine in order to help with his PTSD.

Beached whales can be seen on the [Alternative Beach](beach.md), showing that the [Meteorological Anomalies](meteorological_anomalies.md) still happen in this timeline.
###  At The [Alternative Price Household](price_household.md) 
Max is greeted at the front door of the house by [William Price](william_price.md), and meets Chloe who is now a quadriplegic in a wheelchair. She and Chloe venture to the beach to discuss the past, and to catch up. Chloe reveals that she had never known [Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md), and that most of her friends never kept in touch with her after the accident.

She and Max hang out all night and watch *Blade Runner* together. Max falls asleep, while Chloe ends up staying awake all night, despite the two joking that the opposite happened in their childhood. Chloe asks Max to fetch her morphine from the upstairs bathroom for her.

Max can speak with both [Joyce Price](joyce_price.md) and William, and discovers that Chloe's illness, despite bringing them all closer, has ruined the family financially. A letter in the house also reveals that Chloe's condition is terminal. Chloe's School Report Card and a letter from Principal Wells (dated the 8th of August, 2011) reveals that Chloe attended Blackwell, but after her accident and due to the lack of disability access available around the historic campus wasn't able to attend Blackwell anymore. Max gets the morphine for Chloe, and an old photo album. The two look through the album until they come across the photo Max used to travel back to save William. Chloe sidetracks into asking Max to end her life. Being in considerable pain everyday, and witnessing the toll her illness has taken on her family, Chloe begs Max to end her suffering, leaving her with their time together as her last good memory before her death. At this point the player must choose whether to accede to her last request or to leave Chloe. Either way, Max ends her time there by returning to the day of William's death through the photo.

###  Traveling Back 
Max returns to her younger self, and prevents the changes she made previously, burning the photograph and letting William leave the house. She then returns to the [Timeline](original_timeline.md), and finds herself in [Chloe's Room](chloe_s_room.md), piecing together the [:Category:Dark Room Conspiracy](dark_room_conspiracy.md).

###  Extras 
During this time, Max receives [Max's Messages#Alternate Timeline](different_text_messages.md) from people in her new life, and records very [Max's Diary#Alternative Timeline](different_diary_entries.md).

##  Polarized Timeline (2013) 
Max enters the timeline by focusing on the selfie she took on Monday in [Mark Jefferson](mr__jefferson.md)'s class. Similarly to the first alternative timeline, Max's [Max's Messages#Alternative Reality](text_messages_are_altered.md), reflecting the new events. However, her diary entries remain the same.

***Monday, October 7th** - Max warns David about the [Dark Room (Location)](dark_room.md) by text. She hands in a photo to Mr. Jefferson and enters the [Everyday Heroes Photo Contest](everyday_heroes_contest.md).
***Tuesday, October 8th** - The [Diner Cop](diner_cop.md) and two other police officers break into the Dark Room. Max gives David's gun to [Frank Bowers](frank_bowers.md) at the [American Rust Junkyard](junkyard.md).Evident from a message from Chloe to Max. Jefferson and [Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md) are intercepted in the [Blackwell Academy](blackwell_academy.md) [Blackwell Academy Hallway](hallway.md) and subsequently arrested. Rachel Amber's body is discovered. Max and Chloe meet at the [lighthouse](lighthouse.md) and Max comforts Chloe about Rachel.
***Wednesday, October 9th** - [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md) gives a statement at the [Arcadia Bay Police Department](police_station.md).
***Thursday, October 10th** - Max wins the Everyday Heroes Contest. Chloe helps Max to pack for San Francisco in [Max's Room](her_room.md).
***Friday, October 11th** - Max takes a taxi from Blackwell to the airport. She and [Raymond Wells](principal_wells.md) board a plane to San Francisco. Max enters the timeline and talks to Wells about the week's events. She gets a nosebleed. Sometime later, they arrive at the [Zeitgeist Gallery](zeitgeist_gallery.md). Max approaches her photo and has a vision of the [The Storm](tornado.md). She calls Chloe and discovers that the storm is approaching [Arcadia Bay](arcadia_bay.md). Max then focuses on the photograph and returns to the day it was taken.

###  Traveling Back 
Max returns to her room at Blackwell and tears the freshly taken photo, in order to not end up in San Francisco. She then finds herself restrained in the Dark Room on October 11th, in the middle of a conversation with Jefferson.

##  "Flicker" Timelines 
During the comic series, Max briefly shifts into various different timelines one year after the destruction of [Arcadia Bay](arcadia_bay.md). These timelines include:
*The timeline where Max sacrificed Chloe in order to save Arcadia Bay.
*A timeline where Max died at the age of 13, speculated to be the same car accident that killed [William Price](william_price.md).
*A timeline where Arcadia Bay was not destroyed, and Max and Warren are a couple.
*A timeline where Arcadia Bay was not destroyed, and [Dana Ward (Comic Series)](dana_ward.md) never terminated her pregnancy.
*A timeline similar but slightly different to the "Waves" timeline where Max, Chloe, and Rachel are friends living in Arcadia Bay, and Chloe are Rachel are dating.

##  Waves Timeline 

A timeline where Max died at the age of 13, speculated to be the same car accident that killed [William Price](william_price.md).

Max is eventually pulled to a timeline where Chloe and Rachel are dating and are living in Santa Monica. Max never moved back to Arcadia Bay in this timeline, and the Max from the original timeline encounters Chloe and Rachel on the beach. The three become best friends, and Max is unable to return to her original world, with the path back being blocked to her. 

Max lives in Los Angeles with Chloe and Rachel for two years. Eventually, Max comes to learn that there is another person with powers in this world, named Tristan, and searches to try to find a way back to her own world with his aid.
##  Trivia 
*There is a blue {{Wiki|Awareness ribbon}} on the photo album in Alternative Chloe’s room. Among its meanings is ARDS ({{Wiki|Acute respiratory distress syndrome|Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome}}), a medical condition that may be caused by trauma.
*During a conversation with Alternative Chloe, Max mentions the two of them watched *{{Wiki|Power Rangers}}* as children. When Max looks at Chloe's IV drip, she makes a reference to the {{Wiki|Mighty Morphin Power Rangers}}: "That must be her mighty morphine machine..."
*Joyce's aunt, [Dorothy](aunt_dorothy.md), is believed to be a reference to {{Wiki|L. Frank Baum}}'s {{Wiki|Dorothy Gale}} from *{{Wiki|The Wizard of Oz}}*.
*In a letter addressed to William and Joyce by Ray Wells, Wells suggests taking Chloe to "Miskatonic Institute", a school that caters to disabled persons. In {{Wiki|H.P. Lovecraft}}'s {{Wiki|Cthulhu Mythos}}, {{Wiki|Miskatonic University}} is a fictional university that first appeared in the 1922 story, *{{Wiki|Herbert West–Reanimator}}*.
*In an article discussing the Prescott Family, the writer's name is Craig Kennedy. {{Wiki|Craig Kennedy|Professor Craig Kennedy}} is a character that appeared in *Sherlock Holmes* novels written by Arthur B. Reeve.
*In a letter to Joyce from the Arcadia Bay Spinal Center, Dr. Anton Phibes details the Alternative Chloe Price's deteriorating respiratory system. Dr. Anton Phibes was a character in the 1971 British horror film *{{Wiki|The Abominable Dr. Phibes}}*.
*The Alternative Price family is apparently indebted to Donald Clamp lenders, which might be a reference to the corrupt local Clamp corporation from *Gremlins 2.*
*On Alternative Chloe's computer, Max can find a conversation in an online chatroom with someone who's about to start watching *Quantum Leap*.
*Alternative Chloe refers to herself as "Chloe of the Caribbean", which is a reference to the movie *{{Wiki|Pirates of the Caribbean}}*.
*When discussing {{Wiki|Ridley Scott}}'s *{{Wiki|Blade Runner}}*, an adaptation of {{Wiki|Philip K. Dick}}'s novel *{{Wiki|Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?}},* Alternative Chloe mentions she wanted to dye her hair like {{Wiki|List of Blade Runner characters#Pris Stratton|Pris}} had. Pris, however, never dyed the ends of her bangs.
*Alternative Chloe asks Max whether or not she believed {{Wiki|Rick Deckard|Deckard}} was a {{Wiki|Replicant}}. The question is part of a longstanding discussion that began following the release of the film in 1982. The "Final Cut" leans heavily toward the argument supporting the Deckard-Replicant angle. {{Wiki|Ridley Scott}} has stated multiple times that Deckard was, in fact, a Replicant from the beginning.
*Alternative Chloe refers to her morphine injector as "total {{Wiki|Star Trek}} shit".
*In her diary Max mentions Vangelis, the composer of the much known *Blade Runner* soundtrack.
*When Max returns from the bathroom with the morphine, Chloe says, "Finally. Give me the blue pill…". This is a reference to *{{Wiki|The Matrix}}* where the blue pill allows a state of blissful ignorance/illusion.
* At Blackwell, Max notices that Warren has hooked up with Stella. Stella can be seen wearing a light blue top with the words and emoji "**Cool Story :/**". This mirrors the phrase on the patch that Max has on her bag strap in the original timeline.
