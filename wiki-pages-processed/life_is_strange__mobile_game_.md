##  Development 
It was announced for iOS and Android on December 12, 2017.[http://lifeisstrange-blog.tumblr.com/post/168470142496/life-is-strange-coming-to-mobile Life is Strange coming to Mobile, official Tumblr post] On July 18, 2018, the development of all episodes for iOS and Android concluded.

On iOS the first three episodes were released on December 14, 2017, featuring an "enhanced user interface for full-touch screen integration", Unreal Engine 4 enhancements and optimizations, an in-app photo mode and exclusive iMessage stickers. An Android version and the other episodes were announced for early 2018.

On March 29, 2018, the final two episodes were released on iOS, Episode 1 became free (as on the other platforms) and the Android version was confirmed for release later in 2018, targeting Summer due to needing more time for polish.[https://www.hardcoregamer.com/2018/03/29/new-life-is-strange-update-releases-episode-4-episode-5-for-ios-port/294899/ New Life Is Strange Update Releases Episode 4, Episode 5 for iOS Port] (March 29, 2018)[http://lifeisstrange-blog.tumblr.com/post/172380649260/life-is-strange-episodes-4-and-5-are-now-available "Life is Strange episodes 4 and 5 are now available...", official Tumblr post] The update's patch notes mention fixing issues relating to saving, loading, the iCloud saves and the photo mode now allows cycling between Max's skins and poses and additional photo settings. Simplified Chinese subtitles were also added to the game.[http://www.ign.中国/life-is-strange-iphone/20860/news/ios 《奇异人生》在IOS平台更新中文服务 - IGN China][https://steamcn.com/t375359-1-1 SteamCN Discussion]

##  iOS Reception 
The iOS version has a Metascore of 83.[http://www.metacritic.com/game/ios/life-is-strange Metacritic]

The app has been rated 4.1 out of 5 stars from 1750 reviews in the iOS App Store as of June 4, 2018. It received Apple's iOS "Editor's Choice" label. On February 22, 2018, it had 3.6 stars from 1032 reviews.

Common player review criticism seem to be bugs and the controls. Other players first impressions reported some minor differences of the port and a saving bug.[https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/7jq678/s1_e1_my_thoughts_on_episode_1_on_ios/ Reddit post by /u/hopesdead][https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/7jnzrm/all_life_is_strange_ios_impressions/ Reddit post by /u/siant]

Touch Arcade's review called the port "mostly great", praising Dontnod's "visual direction" as stunning and the touch controls as "great". It has "some low resolution assets but the overall feel is the same". Criticized was the still not properly lip synced dialog, some visual issues and the lack of proper controller support.[http://toucharcade.com/2017/12/14/life-is-strange-episode-1-chrysalis-review/ Touch Arcade review]

Destructoid's port report author was impressed by the presentation and criticized controlling Max's movement.[https://www.destructoid.com/life-is-strange-is-hella-awkward-on-mobile-479005.phtml Destructoid iOS port report]

Hardcore Gamers's review noted in the closing comments, there are "different technical issues, much like its console counterpart in 2015, but it's not enough to detract newcomers from experiencing its riveting narrative in full effect." The review praised the feature additions of "Photo Mode and bonuses like the iMessage stickers", concluding "Life Is Strange reiterates why fans need to rewind time and once again step into the shoes of Max".[https://www.hardcoregamer.com/2017/12/20/review-life-is-strange-episodes-1-3-ios/283960/ Hardcore Gamer review]

Apple's iOS "Editor's Choice" Award: "The fragility and fear of growing up. The terror of leaping into the unknown. Life is Strange tackles tough issues in a remarkable way, merging the superpowered and surreal with characters that feel authentic. You’re drawn into the adventure through gorgeous visuals. Sharp writing, excellent voice acting, and a compelling story make solving Life is Strange’s mysteries feel essential."

Sensor Tower estimated iOS app revenue of $80K in January, $100k in March, $50k in April, $50k in May and $60k in June 2018.[https://sensortower.com/ios/us/square-enix-inc/app/life-is-strange/1180101534/overview Sensor Tower] It is also estimated that Japanese users (5%) are the third largest userbase after China (60%) and the USA (15%), making up 10% of users and estimated revenue as of June 4, 2018. The USA seems to achieve more revenue than China despite the notable userbase difference.

##  Android Reception 
The app has been rated 4.1 out of 5 stars from 15640 reviews in the Google Play Store as of July 30, 2018.

Android Authority's review noted that the iOS version suffers from less technical drawbacks and concluded that "while the episodic structure lends itself to casual play on the go", it is an "objectively better game on PC or console, due to the platforms' huge visual and technical advantages."[https://www.androidauthority.com/life-is-strange-review-android-895750/ Life is Strange review: Still a (mostly) hella good time on Android] (Android Authority, August 19, 2018)
