[Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) can ask him if he caught any big fish today. He responds by saying that if by "big" she means "none", then sure, "he caught a lotta big ones today". Afterwards, he says that she should let him mourn over his eggs.

While Max is waiting for her breakfast, he gets up and changes the music on the jukebox.
