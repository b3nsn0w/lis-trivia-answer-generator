##  Lyrics 
: Don't you know that
: I'll be around to guide you
: Through your weakest moments
: To leave them behind you?

: Returning nightmares
: Only shadows
: We'll cast some light and you'll be alright
: We'll cast some light and you'll be alright for now

: Crosses all over
: Heavy on your shoulders
: The sirens inside you
: Waiting to step forward

: Disturbing silence
: Darkens your sight
: We'll cast some light and you'll be alright
: We'll cast some light and you'll be alright for now

: Crosses all over the boulevard (x4)

: The streets outside your window
: Over flooded
: People staring
: They know you've been broken

: Repeatedly reminded
: By the looks on their faces
: Ignore them tonight and you'll be alright
: Cast some light and you'll be alright
