#  The Independent 

**The Independent** is a newspaper. The articles seen in [Life is Strange](the_first_game.md) cover the [Meteorological Anomalies](recent_strange_weather.md). In "[Episode 3: Chaos Theory](chaos_theory.md)", there is a small column dedicated to [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md)'s suicide attempt (headline depends on whether [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) saved her or not). In one of the "[Episode 5: Polarized](polarized.md)" alternative timelines where Max wins the [Everyday Heroes Photo Contest](everyday_heroes_contest.md), an article highlighting the arrest of [Mark Jefferson](mark_jefferson.md) can be found at the [Zeitgeist Gallery](zeitgeist_gallery.md). This newspaper can be obtained from the small kiosk near the [Two Whales Diner](two_whales_diner.md). By managing to catch an issue of it in her second vision in "[Episode 1: Chrysalis](chrysalis.md)," Max finds out the date of [the Storm](the_storm.md) to be October 11.

The newspaper appears again in *[Life is Strange 2](life_is_strange_2.md)*. [Sean Diaz](sean_diaz.md) picks up an issue containing an article about him and his brother [Daniel Diaz](daniel.md) in "[Episode 1: Roads](roads.md)". Reluctant to tell Daniel the truth, Sean later uses the newspaper to ignite the fire.

|**Two Moon Diner?**

Amid all the environmental chaos in Arcadia Bay, such as the unseasonal snowfall and beached whales, some residents reported seeing two full moons last night around 8:00 p.m. Witnesses claimed the double moons were clear in the night sky until clouds covered them up shortly after they appeared. No cellphone or video footage has surfaced yet, which has led local meteorologists to believe that imaginations are in overdrive due to the recent eco-havoc.

|**Blackwell Security Uncovers Bunker and Scandal**

Acting on a series of tips from [David Madsen](david_madsen.md) (Head of Security at Blackwell Academy), police officers descended Tuesday on a bizarre underground chamber, allegedly used by teacher Mark Jefferson and student[ Nathan Prescott](_nathan_prescott.md) to drug, kidnap, and photograph young women. Although there were no other signs of physical or sexual assault on the victims, the disturbing revelations have sent shock waves through the tranquil city of Arcadia Bay. Even [Sean Prescott](sean_prescott.md), the most powerful businessman in the area, is under investigation for his role as owner of the [Prescott Barn](farmhouse.md) where the high-tech "[Dark Room (Location)](dark_room.md)" studio was located.
