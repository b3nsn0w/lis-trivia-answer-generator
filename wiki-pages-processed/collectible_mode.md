#  Collectible Mode 

**Collectible Mode** is a gameplay mode available in *[Life is Strange](life_is_strange.md)*, *[Life is Strange: Before the Storm](life_is_strange__before_the_storm.md)*, and *[Life is Strange 2](life_is_strange_2.md)*.

It enables the player to replay scenes to collect [Optional Photos](optional_photos.md), [Optional Graffiti](optional_graffiti.md) or [Sean's Souvenirs](optional_souvenirs.md), and thereby unlock achievements without affecting the player's choices. A fast-forward function can be activated with a special key/button to skip otherwise unskippable story cutscenes and dialog to the next choice, which dramatically increases the gameplay speed.

It is available after finishing each checkpoint in *Life is Strange* and *Life is Strange 2*, and after finishing each episode in *Before the Storm*. The free-to-download game, *[The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit](the_awesome_adventures_of_captain_spirit.md)*, does not feature a Collectible Mode, as it is a single episode experience and the gameplay is based on a set of tasks that the protagonist, [Chris Eriksen](chris_eriksen.md), must complete in order to make progress.

##  Collectibles 
The games feature different kinds of collectibles that can be obtained:

[File:collmode-optionalgraffiti.png](linkoptional_graffiti.md)[Optional Graffiti](optional_graffiti.md)
[File:collmode-souvenirs.png](link__sean_s_souvenirs.md)[Sean's Souvenirs](souvenirs.md)

##  Trivia

* When in "Collectible Mode", Life is Strange environmental sounds, sometimes don't keep up with Max's fast-forward, for instance during the diner scene in Episode 2, the jukebox may break and still continues playing Chloe's selection.  
* In *Life is Strange 2*, souvenirs obtained in Collectible Mode are marked with "CM".
* The name of this mode in *Before the Storm* is "Collector Mode".
* The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit, is the only Life is Strange franchise game that doesn't have "Collectible Mode".
