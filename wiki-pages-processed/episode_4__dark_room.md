##  Trivia 
*The term "Dark Room" (traditionally spelled "Darkroom") refers to a room used to develop "light-sensitive photographic materials, including photographic film and photographic paper". "Dark Room" also refers to a dark lit room where sexual acts take place in clubs.
*In the alternative timeline, Max and Chloe talk about the "Golden Hour". In photography, the {{Wiki|Golden hour (photography)|golden hour}} is the hour after sunrise or before sunset during which daylight is redder and softer than when the sun is higher in the sky.
*There is a blue {{Wiki|Awareness ribbon}} on the photo album in Alternative Chloe’s room. Among its meanings is ARDS ({{Wiki|Acute respiratory distress syndrome|Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome}}), a medical condition that may be caused by trauma.
*In the alternative timeline, there is a letter in Chloe's room from Principle Wells suggesting she could attend the "H. West Miskatonic Institute". This is a reference to H. P. Lovecraft's 1922 story "Herbert West–Reanimator".
*Nathan's room door slate originally stated "THE PRESCOTTS RULE THIS TOWN!!!". With the patch that was released on January 19, 2016, it was replaced with "LEAVE ME ALONE".
*Before attempting to open [David Madsen](david_madsen.md)'s locker in the garage, Max comments on the padlock, asking "Hey David, whatcha hiding?" This may be a nod to [Chloe](chloe.md)'s voice actress [Ashly Burch](ashly_burch.md)'s popular web series "[http://heyash.com Hey Ash, Whatcha Playin'?]"
*While exploring the [Dark Room (Location)](dark_room.md), Max can find an invoice for the bunker from "Howard Roark Construction." This is a [References (Life is Strange)](reference.md) to the main character, and architect, of the same name in Ayn Rand's novel *The Fountainhead*.
*[File:Hideout graffiti.jpg](thumb.md) If you made the choice of writing a wall message in episode 2 in the wrecked den, after going back to the junkyard at night you can see that someone had graffiti-ed over the writings on the wall in red, probably blood. They change "Rachel was here" into "Rachel is here"- probably a reference to the fact that Rachel's body was buried in the junkyard. It also then circles Chloe's and Max's names and beside it, there is the message: "You're ALL GONNA DIE".
*[File:TX_MinChoice_E4_5A_NathanDoor.png](100px.md) An unused in-game choice graphic called *TX_MinChoice_E4_5A_NathanDoor* can be extracted from the game's files. It can be assumed that Episode 4 originally had a minor choice related to whether Max used her rewind powers in order to fix Nathan's room door or not.
*The episode trailer has some inconsistencies; when looking at the characters, they are wearing the same clothing from previous episodes; however, Max and Chloe's shirts change in the actual episode.
* At the end of the credits on this episode, it says "thanks for crying" instead of "thanks for playing".
