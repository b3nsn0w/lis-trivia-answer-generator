#  Everyday Heroes Photo Contest 

[File:Everyday_Heroes_Poster.png](thumb.md)

The **Everyday Heroes Photo Contest** is a national competition for people to submit one image on approved paper that best represented themselves or others in a heroic action. The winner will fly to {{Wiki|San Francisco}} and represent their school at the [Zeitgeist Gallery](zeitgeist_gallery.md) on October 11. Contestants aged 18 and under will need to have a parent permission form included with their submission. [Mark Jefferson](mark_jefferson.md) told his photography class about the contest on September 23, as mentioned in [Max's Diary](max_s_diary.md)"Speaking of pictures, Mr. Jefferson told us about the national 'Everyday Heroes' photo contest he wants us all to enter. The winner gets a trip to San Francisco and lots of publicity. He wants just one photograph from each student. This is exactly why I wanted to come to Blackwell and of course I'm scared shitless to enter. At least I have a couple weeks before the deadline in October. So I have plenty of time to stress and procrastinate. Sigh." (Max on September 23, 2013), and wanted everyone to enter. It's first mentioned in Jefferson's class right at the beginning of the game when [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) is troubled about entering her own photo. Jefferson seems to be especially keen on Max entering a photo for the contest, possibly to have an easier way to drug her and take her to his [Dark Room (Location)](dark_room.md).

##  Mentions 
The everyday hero theme is a recurring and central motif throughout the game:
* Max feels like an "Everyday Hero" if she defends [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md) when she is being harassed by [David Madsen](david_madsen.md) at the beginning of "[Episode 1: Chrysalis](chrysalis.md)".
* If Max tells Kate not to call the police, she guilt-trips herself in her diary saying, "Hello, 'Everyday Hero'!"
* After helping Kate down the rooftop, Max writes in her diary that she doesn't feel that "everyday heroic".
* After breaking into [Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md)'s [Nathan's Room](dorm_room.md), Max expresses concern at having internalized spying and stealing so casually over the week, and calls herself ironically an "Everyday Hero."
* After being captured by Jefferson, Max writes in her diary in "[Episode 5: Polarized](polarized.md)" that she thought she was a real "everyday superhero", but at the end she is just Max Caulfield.
* After informing David of Jefferson's deeds and helping him in busting Jefferson, Nathan and the Dark Room, Max writes in her diary that David had become a real everyday hero.
* (TBC)

###  Square Enix Photo Contest 
On January 26, 2016, Square Enix initiated a real Everyday Heroes photo contest where fans could submit their own photos of "ordinary people doing extraordinary things" and had the chance to secure a $10,000 scholarship fund. Finalists would have their photo printed, framed, and signed by the DONTNOD staff as well as featured on Square Enix social channels.[http://www.polygon.com/2016/1/26/10834900/life-is-strange-everyday-heroes-scholarship-fund-contest Life is Strange sponsors actual Everyday Heroes photo contest] (January 26, 2016) There was a section were where people could submit their entries on the official website.

##  Trivia 
* The last episode, "[Episode 5: Polarized](polarized.md)", was released on 20th October 2015, exactly 2 years after the date of the original winner of the Everyday Heroes Photo Contest departing for San Francisco.
* The Everyday Heroes Photo Contest exhibition was originally advertised to be hosted at the DeYoung Museum of Art on October 20, the deadline scheduled to be October 15, 2013. As explained in the [Director's Commentary](director_s_commentary.md), the developers later realized that an exhibition of this nature would rather be hosted at an art gallery than a museum and so changed it after the release of "[Episode 1: Chrysalis](chrysalis.md)".
* With the release of the [Limited Edition (Life is Strange)](limited_edition.md), the submissions of Victoria Chase and Daniel DaCosta were swapped, it was most likely to be a fix for error: in earlier versions, both of the two photos were unfitting Max's comments and not showing the submitters' photography skills accordingly.
* An entry rule of the photo contest was to "submit an image that best represents yourself or others in heroic action". Max's entry, at first glance, does not appear to show her participating in any heroic action other than looking at a wall of photographs she has taken. However, the focus in the photo does not lie on Max, but on the pictures she has taken. This could imply that the subjects of those photos are everyday heroes to Max, because they enable her to carry out her greatest passion; photography.
* An unused subtitle line indicates that Evan had submitted a photo at some point in development. "Act_E3_2A_Corridor_EverydayHeroPhoto4_Look01_Max_010"How can my sad selfies compete with this? Evan has a lens for an eye...""
* Daniel DaCosta's entry for the Everyday Heroes photo contest is actually of [Gary Jamroz-Palma](gary_jamroz_palma.md) working at a desk inside [Don't Nod](dontnod.md)'s studio. This finding was confirmed] by Writer [Michel Koch](michel_koch.md) on Twitter.[https://twitter.com/cuddlecuffs/status/1099165180418842625 Twitter post by Michel Koch] Artist Edouard Caplain has been known to draw sketches of people at the office including himself.
