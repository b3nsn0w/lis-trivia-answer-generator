> 'The Prescott Dormitory.' Good Lord, Nathan's family owns my dorm?!

**[Maxine Caulfield**, Max](maxine_caulfield____max.md)'s monologue when she looks at the dormitory plaque in [Episode 1: Chrysalis, Chrysalis](episode_1__chrysalis__chrysalis.md)

The **Prescott Dormitory** is the name of the dormitory of [Blackwell Academy](blackwell_academy.md). It is owned by [Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md)'s [Prescott Family](family.md), having been generously donated in 1998. Within the same building, there are separate living spaces for male and female students. Janitor [Samuel Taylor](samuel_taylor.md)'s [Custodial Room](custodial_room.md)Â is located to the left of the dormitory entrance. On the dormitory grounds in front of the building's entrance, there is the mysterious [Native American](native_american.md) [Tobanga Totem](tobanga_totem.md).

##  The Girls' Dorm 
* Rooms 217 - 228
* Hallway
* TV Lounge (non-explorable)
* Vending Room (non-explorable)
* Girls Toilet (non-explorable)
* Shower Room

[File:Blackwell Academy Girls Dormitory.jpg](thumb.md)

###  Hallway 
In the hallway, there are several notice boards, as well as individual slates for each dorm room. Most of the posters on the walls are related to social events within the school, and notices for the students. There are posters also outlining rules, as the posters in the girls' dorm proclaim "No Boys Allowed". The slates of each room occasionally change in the dorm; for example after [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md)'s incident, there are encouraging messages rather than graffiti or slander.

At the end of the hallway, a staircase leads down to the lower floor. Only a small section of these stairs is visible in the game.

###  Shower Room 
This location is first accessed in [Episode 2: Out of Time](episode_2.md), in the morning as [Maxine Caulfield](max.md) gets ready for the day. She showers, and witnesses Kate being hassled by [Victoria Chase](victoria.md), [Courtney Wagner](courtney_wagner.md) and [Taylor Christensen](taylor_christensen.md). The plumbing is not the best, as the water becomes cold as soon as anyone turns on a sink tap and one of the shower heads is out of order. The shower room is also available to explore in the [Episode 3: Chaos Theory](third_episode.md), as Max can speak to Taylor about Victoria sneaking out. During [Max's Nightmare](max_s_nightmare.md) section in [Episode 5: Polarized](episode_5.md), Max may find a key with [Dana Ward](dana_ward.md)'s room number on a table outside the shower room after seeing Kate enter her room and jump off into an empty space inside. After entering [Dana's Room](dana_s_room.md), [Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md)'s room and [Victoria's Room](victoria_s_room.md), Max will also see a group of giant squirrels outside the window next to the shower room door. Max may take an [Optional Photos](optional_photo.md) of this group of giant squirrels.

###  Bathroom 
There is a toilet which is unexplorable throughout the game, which is only opened during the morning of the second episode as someone throws a roll of toilet paper at an unsuspecting [Alyssa Anderson](alyssa_anderson.md). Max can rewind and intervene with the event. Max may also open the door and enter it during her nightmare section in episode 5, but it will lead nowhere and return Max as her current character to the dormitory entrance.

* [Victoria's Room](victoria_s_room.md)
* [Kate's Room](kate_s_room.md)
* [Dana's Room](dana_s_room.md)

###  Posters, Fliers, and Notes 
There are several missing posters for Rachel Amber on bulletin boards all over the dormitory. In addition to this, reward fliers, items-for-sale fliers, club posters, advocacy posters, and notes from students appear on them. Several posters on campus are vandalized with graffiti, a notable amount making fun of Kate Marsh and the semi-viral video that was taken of her.

###  Hallway 
The most notable difference between the girls' and boys' dorm hallways is that of the graffiti and general untidiness. The boys have no shame in scrawling everywhere, blocking out signs with rules, and making sexual jokes about other students. The chart with the room allocations is completely destroyed with graffiti, leaving Max to find [Nathan Prescott](nathan.md)'s room with no assistance from it.Although she can simply be sent the room number by Kate Marsh if she is still alive, and if Max confronted her about Nathan during her [hospital](hospital.md) visit. As with the girls' dorm, the boys have individual room slates.

##  Trivia 
* There are unused audio files for when Max enters the boys' dormitory in Episode 4 to look for Nathan's room. The majority of these are labelled "WarrenToilet" in the game's text files and appear as though they may be range-enabled dialogue that can be heard when Max nears the area. These particular files sound muffled and distant as though they are coming from the other side of a closed door. Warren appears to be playing a video game: "Come on, baby..." [File:Headphones.png](16px.md) . . . "Gimme those points, freaky octopus..." [File:Headphones.png](16px.md) . . . "One more match and youâre mine..." [File:Headphones.png](16px.md) . . . "Level up, bitch!" [File:Headphones.png](16px.md)
**Linked to these files is an audio file named "ToiletDoor_Look" where Max makes a mental comment about what she is hearing: "When you gotta play, you gotta play... Remind me not to use that guy's phone." [File:Headphones.png](16px.md) These audio files do make it appear as though Max has walked inside the boys' toilets. What is interesting is that, in the game itself, Max cannot interact with the door to the boys' toilets (i.e. there is no "look" or "open"), so she is unable to go inside. Perhaps DONTNOD came to the decision that having Max go into the boys' toilets was rather pointless, far too nosy of her, and delayed the objective to find and explore Nathan's room.
**There is another audio file that appears to be a cue for when Max would have looked at the heavily graffitied door to the boys' toilets: "Even if my bladder was on fire, I would never enter that door. Ever." [File:Headphones.png](16px.md) Unlike the files mentioned above, no subtitle text file exists for this audio in the game files. Perhaps the decision to leave this out of the text files was made after it was decided that Max would not enter the boys' toilets after all.
**Another unused file of note is a surprised "Max?" that Warren may have been planned to say upon seeing Max inside the boys' dormitory. [File:Headphones.png](16px.md)
*In early [Concept Art (Life is Strange)](concept_art.md) for Max's room that appears on [Feral Interactive](feral_interactive.md)'s [https://www.feralinteractive.com/en/games/lifeisstrange/ website], Max appeared to have an environmentally conscious roommate. A poster that appears in Victoria's room in-game (a bird with paint drips) can be seen under the bunk in the early art, but [media:Victoria_bedroom_concept_art.jpg](concept_art_for_victoria_s_room.md) also exists. The concept artist, [Edouard Caplain](edouard_caplain.md), was asked about Max's roommate, and the reply was that Max did originally have one (all students had them at the time), and this was a Greenpeace/hippie style student, but she was cut and is not in-game.
