###  **Alternative Beach** 
*Max walks next to Chloe as they stroll down the path next to the beach.*

**Chloe: **It's weird hanging out with you again.

**Max: **I know... I'm glad we are, though.

**Chloe: **It was nice that you sent me actual letters. That's more than any of my other friends have done... And you even wrote on that cool parchment paper. That's so Max.

**Max: **So pretentious. But I love writing on it, like an English poet. You deserve the best stationery.

**Chloe: **Probably easier to write than to visit me. I don't mean that in a bitchy way. Not totally. You probably wanted to avoid awkward conversations like this.

**Max: **Uh...pretty much, yeah.

**Chloe: **Look, the worst thing you can do is treat me like a baby. I still want to laugh and talk shit with my best friend. Can we stop? This is seriously the best view of the sunset. What do photographers call that?

**Max: **"The golden hour."

**Chloe: **See? Without you here, I'd have no clue. Bet you could take some amazing shots... Those beached whales are so sad. I kind of know how they feel... At least I'm alive here with you.

**Max: **You're a real survivor, Chloe. I know you have to deal with so much.

**Chloe: **I don't want anybody else feeling sorry for me. I can do that...along with my parents. My dad still feels guilty about buying me that car.

Talk about accident?# Talk about accident?**Max:** Are you okay to talk about the accident?

**Chloe:** We never actually have, huh? There's not much to say. Some prick in an SUV cut me off and I flew into a ditch.

|-|Blame William?Blame William?**Max:** You don't really blame William...do you?

**Chloe:** For getting me the hybrid I wanted for my sweet sixteen? No, I blame the asshole who cut me off and sent me into a ditch.

**Max: **Do you...remember everything?

**Chloe: **I saw everything in bullet time. I felt my back snap and... And that was the last thing I ever felt in my body. When I woke up in the hospital, I literally couldn't move a muscle.

**Max: **Jesus! I...I don't know what to say.

**Chloe: **Don't say anything. I'm just happy I did get to see you again. I could have ended up vanishing out of the blue like that girl from Blackwell.

You mean Rachel?# You mean Rachel?**Max:** You mean Rachel Amber? When was the last time you talked to her?

**Chloe:** Uh, never. I just read about her in the news. I didn't even know her name. You did?

|-|What missing girl?What missing girl?**Max:** What missing girl?

**Chloe:** I don't know her name, just read about it in the news. I feel bad for her family.

**Max: **This is such a different world than when we were kids, isn't it...

**Chloe: **After that snow and eclipse, it's more like the end of the world.

You think?# You think?**Max:** Do you think so? I haven't kept up with the details.

**Chloe:** I have more time on my hands than you... Plus I'm a science nerd. But none of this makes sense.

|-|It might be.It might be.**Max:** It might be, but...I'd like to think we can still change things for the better.

**Chloe:** I'd like to think that too...but I don't have much hope these days.

|-|Don't say that.# Don't say that.**Max:** Don't say that.

**Chloe:** Not trying to bum you out. It just seems like Arcadia Bay is having a meltdown.

**Max: **I know things seem out of control, but...as long as we're together, I don't feel afraid.

**Chloe: **Hanging out with you makes me feel like a total kid again. You don't even know...

**Max: **Listen, Chloe...I'm sorry I haven't been out to see you more. That was wrong. You're my best friend.

**Chloe: **Max, thanks for coming out to see me. You're...you're doing awesome.

**Max: **I don't think so.

**Chloe: **Um. My...my nose is getting cold. Maybe we should get back to my place.

**Max: **It is hella cold out here.

**Chloe: **"Hella"? I hate that word, no offense.

**Max: **None taken.

''Max and Chloe turn around and head back towards Chloe's house.*

###  *'Alternative Chloe's House** 

###  **Alternative Chloe's Room** # 
**Max: **This is a pretty high-tech lair.

**Chloe: '''Feels like a high-tech cell. But I am lucky my parents bust their ass to take care of me. I know it's hard for them...

**Max: **They're grateful you are here with them.

**Chloe: **Right. Especially when they can't even take a walk alone. Sometimes I act like a total teenage brat just to give them an excuse to yell at me. Pathetic, I know.

**Max: **Chloe, you're a great daughter. You're kind and sensitive, when you don't even have to be.

**Chloe: **Trust me, I still get my rage on. Especially when a nurse has to watch while I take a dump, so she can wipe my bum. Or when doctors flip me around like I was a science doll...

**Max: **I can't even imagine... But you're still amazing. You always have been since we were kids.

**Chloe: **Thanks again for coming, Max. I, uh...need to get my drink on. Can you bring me some water?

*Max gets up from her chair.*

*Max gives Chloe a cup of water on the nightstand.*

**Max: **Drink up, buttercup.

**Chloe: **Oh man, no wonder my throat is dry. I don't think I've talked this much the whole year.

**Max: **Have you ever thought about doing a podcast or something?

**Chloe: **I wish I could punch your face right now. A podcast? Dude, I am a pod in a cast. Boring.

**Max: **Ouch. It was just a thought...

**Chloe: **I know you're just trying to help.

**Max: **Yeah, that's become a bad habit of mine...

**Chloe: **You sound like an adult now. It seems like we were kids in another life.

You're right.You're right.**Max:** You're right... I wish I could take us all the way back there again.

**Chloe:** Wish I could build us a...DeLorean.

**Max:** Well, um, with your scientific mind, you might do that. But time travel can screw things up, too...

**Chloe:** Plus, you'd have to be my live-in assistant to help me build a machine.

|-|What do you remember?# What do you remember?**Max:** What do you remember about us as kids? We all have different memories...

**Chloe:** I think about us as little pirates, running and jumping through Arcadia Bay.

**Max:** Me too. But, we're still pirates in our own way.

**Chloe:** Uh, yeah, right. Check me out, "Chloe of the Caribbean." No way will I get on a fucking boat now. Unless you're with me.

|-|Seems like yesterday.Seems like yesterday.**Max:** To me, it seems like yesterday we were little brats here, watching "Power Rangers" and destroying the kitchen.

**Chloe:** Oh my God, we covered everything in flour, even my parents.

**Max:** That was so hilarious!

**Chloe:** But a long time ago. You're the only person I grew up with who visits me...

**Chloe: **As you can see, I can't keep all my other friends away.

Which friends?# Which friends?**Max:** Which friends did you hang out with the most?

**Chloe:** Megan Weaver, but you don't know her. She was cool. But after my accident she was too cool for school.

|-|You have me.You have me.**Max:** You have me. I'm not leaving you, Chloe.

**Chloe:** Well, you didn't visit me a lot either. I mean, I loved your cards and photos, but...

**Max: **I know I wasn't around much. No excuses, I'm a loser. But, I am trying to make things right.

**Chloe: **How? Dude, you're not Super Max. And I'm not trying to guilt-trip you. That's what my parents are for...

Are they okay?# Are they okay?**Max:** Are they okay? I mean, are they still happy together and everything?

**Chloe:** So now you're Dr. Bill? I guess they're good, considering they have to deal with me. They laugh and hold hands...and I hope they still get busy too... 

|-|Are you lonely?Are you lonely?**Max:** I know this is a dumb question, but...are you lonely here?

**Chloe:** Yes, dumb question. I don't mind being alone. I can't exactly go party like a rock star, though...or get in any teen trouble with the folks.

|-|They love you.# They love you.**Max:** They love you so much.

**Chloe:** I know. My mom and dad are so cute. They always pop in here and make sure everything's okay with me.

**Max: **I think Joyce and William are incredible.

**Chloe: **Max, the accident has been so hard on them. Our insurance sucks and the medical bills are fucking insane.

I bet.I bet.**Max:** I bet. This tech must be crazy expensive.

**Chloe:** Along with the drugs, the nurses, the supplies... Mom and Dad are always broke and they get so frustrated... Is it worth it?

|-|Can they pay?# Can they pay?**Max:** Can they pay all the bills?

**Chloe:** No way. They keep the numbers away from me, but it doesn't take much research to find out I'm costing my parents almost a million dollars a year.

**Max: **Chloe, you're priceless. Uh, no pun intended.

**Chloe: **You are such a geek. That's why I love you. Of course, I know a geek when I be one. See, I'm practically a human entertainment system. It would be sweet to chill out together and watch a movie, like when you'd spend the night at my house...

**Max: **What do you want to watch?

**Chloe: **Uh, I think I'm in, like, a mellow "Blade Runner" mood. I always cry at the end. Plus you know I always wanted to have cool colored bangs like Pris.

**Max: **I know. You would look incredible with blue hair. Now let's get this show on the road. And you better not fall asleep on me, like you always do when we watch movies.

**Chloe: **I remember, Max. Swear I won't fall asleep. Not when you're here. Not yet.

**Optional Conversation with Chloe**

''Max uses the tissue box to clean Chloe's face.''

**Chloe: **Thanks. I think you missed a grain stuck in my eyeball.

**Max: **Hard to believe how just a little sand can cause such a big mess.

**Chloe: **It's like that Chinese proverb, "A spark can start a fire that burns the entire prairie." You know, like that butterfly thing...

**Max: **So I've heard...

*Max searches the left drawer beneath the TV to get the DVD.*

**Max (thinking):** Aha, here's the DVD.

*Max places the DVD in the player and sits next to Chloe. They start watching Blade Runner; Max is next shown waking up in the morning.*

**Max: **I cannot believe you fell asleep so fast. How dare you.

**Chloe: **I know you were beat down after the day with me. And Blade Runner is a pretty dreamy movie to watch at night. Uh, do you think Deckard is a replicant? Sorry, I can see you're not wide awake like me.

**Max: **No, I'm sorry I crashed so hard. Were you...okay?

**Chloe: **I do have a mother and father when you're not falling asleep on me.

**Max: **You are a bitch in the morning.

**Chloe: **It's the company I keep... Yesterday was such a blast.

**Max: **It was great, seeing you.

**Chloe: **I know things were different when we were just dorky kids, but being with you made me feel like we were little pirates, jumping and running through the forests again. It meant a lot to me just to chill out with you and bullshit. Ahh... Fuck. Um, I'm getting my regular head pains... Uh, can you pretty please go upstairs and get my--my morphine injector in the bathroom?

**Max: **Morphine injector?

**Chloe: **It's--ahh. It's total Star Trek shit. You can't even see the needle. Seriously, I need it. Um, my parents keep the swag upstairs because they think I can't get to it...but you can, Max. Like a pirate, right?

**Max: **I'm on it, Chloe.

**Second Optional Conversation with Chloe**

**Chloe: ** So, are you sure it isn't too weird for you to be hanging out with me like this?

Kind of.Kind of.**Max:** Kind of, but only because I haven't seen you in so long... I was selfish.

**Chloe:** No, you were busy kicking ass. I don't blame anyone for bailing on me. People suck. Just joking.

|-|No way.# No way.**Max:** No way. I don't want you to feel weird.

**Chloe:** My life is just so different than yours. I mean, we can't just bounce out of here and... I'll be doped up half the day in pain. So that's cool.

**Chloe: **But I do feel grateful I can see the ocean, that I have parents who love me, and that my best friend is here with me today.

**Max: ** Exactly. So, what else do you need?

**Chloe: ** Well, hot monkey sex would be nice. Oh, look, I made Maxine blush! So, are you dating anyone at Blackwell?

Too busy.Too busy.**Max:** I'm too busy with school and photography.

**Chloe:** Oh, please. You can't be an artist unless you experience life... That includes boys, girls, whatever.

|-|Not really.# Not really.**Max:** Not really, no. There are some cute boys there, but you know me... I'm too damn shy.

**Chloe:** Which is stupid because you are so damn cool. Some bro has to be crushing on you.

Accepted Warren's invitationAccepted Warren's invitation**Max:** I was supposed to go out with this guy named Warren, but I don't think he's into me anymore...

|-|Declined Warren's invitation# Declined Warren's invitation**Max:** This guy Warren asked me out, but I turned him down. Now he's with somebody else...

**Chloe:** His loss. You need to move on, girl. Plenty of fish in the 'Bay... Shit, I sound like my dad.

That's okay.That's okay.**Max:** That's okay if you sound like William. He really cares about you.

**Chloe:** Rub it in. I can't ever get mad at the fool. He does so much for me... I haven't done jack for him.

|-|How is William?# How is William?**Max:** How is William? Do you... like having him around?

**Chloe:** Of course, he's my hero. I swear he would do anything for me or Mom. Wish I could do something for him...

**Max:** You have. You're here with your family.

**Chloe:** More like they're here for me. But then, so are you... so it's all good.

###  **Downstairs** # 
**Optional Conversation with William**

**Max: **Hey, William. Am I bothering you?

**William: **Why, yes, Max, I love going through bills. Kidding. How can you bother me? I haven't seen you in forever.

**Max: **I know. You look exactly the same. It's so cool.

**William: **Good, or I'd be ascared if I didn't look like me... Of course, you seem more adult now. So what's on your mind?

Chloe.Chloe.**Max:** I don't know how to say this, but I am truly sorry about what happened to Chloe.

**William:** Me too. All it takes is a few minutes to change a girl's whole life. But she's alive. And she's been a trooper.

{{#tag:tabber|Is she mad at me?# Is she mad at me?**Max:** Is she mad at me for not staying in touch? She should be, I have no excuse.

**William:** She was disappointed, but she knows you care. And I know how hard it is to process all this. It's taken us years.

{{!}}-{{!}}Glad you're here.Glad you're here.**Max:** She is so amazing. I'm so glad you're here to help her...and be her father.

**William:** I'm so glad Joyce is here to help us both. Max, I just hate to think of what would happen to Chloe if I wasn't here...
}}

**Max:** William, I just want you to know that whatever happens, I'll always be here for Chloe. Always.

**William:** I know you will, Max.

|-|Care room.# Care room.**Max:** I was impressed by Chloe's room and all the high-tech equipment.

**William:** You should be. We could buy a few mansions for what it all costs. The insurance helps, but...I don't know, Max.

**Max:** I know it must be hard on you guys, financially.

**William:** These bills are more like crushing. We have to mortgage our home and that's pretty scary...but we'll get through it. The Price is always right. Get it? No?

|-|Joyce.Joyce.**Max:** Being around you and Joyce again is so nostalgic.

**William:** Very old school, as they say. I think it's great for Chloe to see you. It makes Joyce happy, too. So it's not all bad news in Arcadia Bay. Or is it?

{{#tag:tabber|Rachel Amber.# Rachel Amber.**Max:** I was reading about that missing girl...Rachel Amber?

**William:** Oh yes, she went to Blackwell, right? Poor thing. That's a real nightmare for a family... I get scared thinking about Chloe and that we might...lose her someday.

{{!}}-{{!}}Crazy weather.Crazy weather.**Max:** What do you think is going on with all of this crazy weather and animals dying?

**William:** Nobody knows, right? It's Nostradamus type shit, pardon my French. But all I actually care about now is Chloe and Joyce. My family.

{{!}}-{{!}}Prescott family.# Prescott family.**Max:** The Prescott family might be bad news. What do you think about them?

**William:** Evil. Next question?

**Max:** Sounds like you know them well.

**William:** More than I want to. But Joyce has to work for those greedy bastards at Pan Estates. I don't even like to think about it.
}}

|-|Paris trip. (If Max saw the Eiffel Tower replica)Paris trip. (only available after looking at Eiffel Tower replica)**Max:** So you finally made it to Paris?

**William:** "Oui," as they say. Not me, because I can't speak French. But it was a great experience, especially for Chloe.

**Max:** I can see her loving it there. You guys rock for going on a family adventure like that.

**William:** She talked about going to school there...but that's not practical anymore. It's not fair, Max...

|-|Leave.# Leave.**Max:** I have to go see if Chloe needs anything. It was so great talking with you again.

**William:** You act like it's the last time. And please, keep me from this bills whenever you want.

###  **Upstairs** # 
**Optional Conversation with Joyce**

**Joyce: **Good morning, Max. You and Chloe are so much quieter now than when you were kids.

**Max: **I remember. It's nice waking up in your house again.

**Joyce: **Oh, William and I love it. Finally seeing you and Chloe together after all these years...after the accident...

William.William.**Max:** I have to tell you how much I love seeing you and William together again.

**Joyce:** He's been such a hero through all this. Chloe and I are lucky to have him.

{{#tag:tabber|William still the same?# William still the same?**Max:** Is William still the same...after everything that's happened?

**Joyce:** For better and for worse...but always for the better. I never thought I'd love a man so much I can't imagine life without him. Sounds corny, I know.

{{!}}-{{!}}Chloe and William.Chloe and William.**Max:** Chloe and William still seem like they get along so good.

**Joyce:** Yeah, those two are closer now more than ever. Chloe will actually listen to William, while she usually ignores me. Oh, it's so cute when they gang up on poor ol' me...
}}

**Max:** You rule, Joyce.

**Joyce:** Shit, things would be different if I did... I like how you think, kid.

|-|Joyce.# Joyce.**Max:** How are you doing, Joyce?

**Joyce:** I'm doing the best I can, Max. I won't lie, it's difficult...but nobody said life was easy here in Arcadia Bay.

{{#tag:tabber|David Madsen.David Madsen.**Max:** Do you know somebody named David Madsen? He, um...might hang out at the Two Whales.

**Joyce:** Well, that was random. Yeah, he's a bus driver. He comes in sometimes. Cute, quiet. Why?

**Max:** Oh, um...I was just...curious.

**Joyce:** You always were. Nice to see that everything doesn't change.

{{!}}-{{!}}Lot of work.# Lot of work.**Max:** Plus you guys have to work, too.

**Joyce:** Bill and I have no time for ourselves, and we're working more than we're living. I even had to take a part-time gig at Pan Estates. Ugh.

**Max:** Do you know the Prescotts?

**Joyce:** I know that Sean Prescott won't be happy until he owns everything in Arcadia Bay. Stay away from his son, Nathan.

{{!}}-{{!}}Eco-havoc.Eco-havoc.**Max:** So, what do you think is going on here with all this eco-havoc?

**Joyce:** Maybe Arcadia Bay just wants to be left alone... I know the feeling. Honestly, I don't give a shit about too much outside our house.

**Max:** I don't blame you, Joyce.

**Joyce:** Except now we have dead birds and beached whales outside our front door... So maybe I should care, for Chloe's sake.
}}

|-|Chloe.# Chloe.**Max:** I wish I was a better friend. I know Chloe doesn't get many visitors.

**Joyce:** Oh, Max, you're Chloe's best friend for a reason. You're here exactly when she needs you.

{{#tag:tabber|I hope so.I hope so.**Max:** I hope so. You guys do such an amazing job taking care of her.

**Joyce:** We can only do so much...and she gets damn sick of her parents. That's why it's so important you came to spend time with her. 

{{!}}-{{!}}Chloe needs help.# Chloe needs help.**Max:** Who helps Chloe out when you guys are at work?

**Joyce:** We have a series of revolving nurses and caretakers... Chloe still causes trouble, even if she can't move...
}}

**Joyce:** Max, Chloe's condition is not improving. Her respiratory system is very weak and she...she...do you know what I'm saying?

**Max:** Oh, Joyce, I'm so sorry you have to go through all this.

**Joyce:** Bad or good, I embrace every moment with my daughter and husband. This is what it means to be a family...and we'll always be one, no matter what.

|-|Leave.Leave.**Max:** I better get back to Chloe now. It's good talking with you, Joyce.

**Joyce:** You too, honey.

*Max enters the bathroom and takes the morphine injector from the left side of the cupboard above the toilet.*

**Max (thinking): **Here it is. Never thought I'd be delivering morphine to my best friend.

# ###  **Downstairs** 
*Max returns to Chloe and gives her the morphine.*

**Chloe: **Finally. Give me the blue pill...

**Max: **I'm sorry. I'm nosy, but not precise.

**Chloe: **Go ahead and plug it right in. It's so easy. And painless.

**Max: **Um, okay, but get ready to yell for your folks if I screw up. ''(Max injects the morphine into Chloe's IV)''

**Chloe: **Oh, trust me, I will. Of course, my pain just keeps getting worse...but you caught me on a good day. Max, I'm so grateful that I'm even able to hang out with you. See, I'm getting mushy. I'm already high.

**Max: **You are so adorable. Do you want anything else?

**Chloe: **Um, stop me if I'm being too emo, but can you grab one of the photo albums over there? I'd like to check out some old pictures of us when we were kids.

**Max: **Please. My diary is like emo ground zero. Plus Max Caulfield does not pass up a photo op with Chloe Price. Ever.

''Max takes the photo album on the chest of drawers near the window, then returns to Chloe and places the album on Chloe's lap.*

**Max: **Is that okay?

**Chloe: **Perfect. Oh my god, look how little we are there! We look like toys!

**Max: **I remember that day by the lighthouse.

**Chloe: **My dad was pissed at us. He actually tried to give us a time-out!

**Max: **And you laughed at him. My dad would have banished me.

*Max turns the page.''

**Chloe: **Whoa, awesome picture. We look so badass in our pirate gear.

**Max: **We should have taken over Arcadia Bay when we had the chance.

**Chloe: **There's still time for you...

*Max turns the page.*

**Chloe: **Oh man, there we are making pancakes. I love that shot of us. It's hard to believe my dad took that picture only five years ago.

**Max: **Literally seems like yesterday...

**Chloe: **I wish it was.

**Max: **Me too...

**Max (thinking): **This photo... Maybe I could...

**Chloe: **Listen, Max, my respiratory system is failing and...and it's only getting worse. I've heard the doctors talking about it when they thought I was zonked out. So I know I'm just putting off the inevitable, while my parents suffer along...and I will, too. This isn't how I want things to end.

**Max: **What? What are you saying?

**Chloe: **I'm saying that being with you again has been so special. I just wanted to feel like when we were kids running around Arcadia Bay...and everything was possible. And you made me feel that way today. I want this time with you to be my last memory... Do you understand?

**Max: **Yes, I do.

**Chloe: **All you have to do is crank up the IV to eleven...

ACCEPT# ACCEPT**Max:** Chloe...

**Chloe:** I'll just drift asleep...dreaming of us here together...forever.

*Max gets up, turns up the IV, then sits down again.*

**Chloe:** Thank you so much. I'm so proud of you for following your dreams. Don't forget about me.

**Max:** Never.

**Chloe:** I love you, Max. See you around.

**Max:** Sooner than you think.

''Chloe's eyes close and her muscles relax.''

|-|REFUSEREFUSE**Max:** Chloe...I can't. It wrecks me to see you in any pain, but I don't have any right to do this.

**Chloe:** I'm an adult. I'm giving you the right.

**Max:** But Joyce...and William...

**Chloe:** I already said my goodbyes to them, but they won't honor my wishes. You will...right?

**Max:** I can't...kill you with an overdose.

**Chloe:** Max, I'm dying from my illness, not my dosage. This accelerates the process. I'd rather go out on a wave than a rock. And I want my best friend to help me out...

**Max:** I'm going to help you, but not like that. You have to believe me, Chloe.

**Chloe:** Why, Max? You're just bailing on me like everybody else! Why don't you go now? You've been wanting to since you got here, right? So go and don't come back. *(Chloe turns her face away from Max)*

**Max:** Chloe, I am never leaving you again.

|-|I DON'T KNOW# I DON'T KNOW**Max:** Chloe...I really don't know if I can do this. I had another friend who wanted to...end it all and I did everything I could to try and save her life. How can I be responsible for ending yours? I mean, there's got to be another way.

**Chloe:** Max, you were there for your friend no matter what. Now I'm asking you to help me the same way.

**Max:** I want to help you, Chloe, but I think my help is hurting.

**Chloe:** At least you have a choice. When you want to make a decision, you can just do it. Look at me, I'm at the mercy of...everybody. For once, I want to make my own choice...the most important one of my life. Please...help me, Max.

*Max is forced to choose to ACCEPT or REFUSE*

*Max focuses on the photo.*

**Max: **I'm sorry, William...

*After a successful focus, Max returns to her 13-year-old body.*

###  '''Young Chloe's House'* 
*(Camera flashes)''

**Chloe: **Someday Dad will get one of them newfangled computers.

**William: **I hope the flash didn't scare you, Max. This is a keeper.

*(Phone rings, William picks up)*

**William: **Hello? Hey, honey... What? Oh, I didn't know you had to get groceries. Of course I'll come pick you up.

*(Max stands near the fireplace and looks at the photo William just took)*

**William (in background): **Shit, where are my keys?

**Chloe (in background): **That's a dollar for the swear jar!

**William (in background): **You mean your college fund. Keys, please...

*(William searches under the hat and finds the keys)*

**William: **A-ha! You can't hide from me forever!

*(Max burns the photo in the fireplace)*

**William (in background): **And no Chloe and Max wine-tasting session...

**Chloe (in background): **Dad!

**William: **Don't blow it because tonight your mother promised to make her world-famous salmon surprise with chocolate cake for dessert. Max, you'll be here too, right?

**Chloe: **She's never leaving me!

**William: **That makes all of us. *(William walks out the door)*

*(Max leans against the wall with her head in her hands)*

**Chloe: **Max, you are being so fucking strange, like you're never going to see us again.

**Max: **Chloe, I'm so sorry... I tried to make things different for you... I...I did try...I'm sorry.

**Chloe: **I don't know exactly what you're talking about, but come on. ''(Chloe holds Max's hands, then lets go) ''You have made things different, like my whole life. You're my best friend. I've got you and a great family. What's to be sorry for? We'll be best friends forever. And when we grow up we're taking over the world.

**Max: **Listen, whatever happens, I want you to be strong. Even if you feel like I wasn't there for you...because I will never abandon you, Chloe. ''(Max holds Chloe's hands) ''I'll always have your back. Always.

*(Fades to white, scenes of the alternative timeline revert back to the original events)*

**Chloe:** Oh yeah, now you suddenly want to kiss me? You had your chance.

**Max: **I'm just...I'm just--I'm so glad you're here!

**Chloe: **You sound high, but thanks for the morning grope. Since we were up all night playing "CSI: Arcadia Bay," I was still spaced out here, trying to put all this info together. ''(Max sits down on the edge of Chloe's bed) ''Max, did you forget we've gone over this? I hope you weren't messing around with time while I was sleeping...

**Max: **Not anymore. I'm just spaced out, too.

**Max (thinking): **Welcome back to the real world, Max... I don't think I can ever tell Chloe about what happened.

*Max gets up.*

**Max: **Let's look at the big board and see all our pieces in the puzzle so far.

*Examine the board*

**Max: **So close, yet so far away... We have to do three main things.

**Chloe: **Right...uh, what things?

**Max: **One, decipher Frank's logbook. Two, get Nathan's phone to find out where he's been during the Vortex Club parties with Kate and Rachel. And see whatever hidden shit he's got in his messages.

**Chloe: **Three, beat step-douche down until he tells us about Frank, Nathan, and the "Dark Room."

**Max:** Keep it in your pants.

**Max:** Yes, that's the solution.

**Max: **We'll have to do this on our own.

**Max: **Which I can't waste on shit like that. Or Blackwell would be in big trouble.

**Max:** Don't remind me. I just want him off your back. Our back...

**Chloe: **I know. You should get busy in the garage to see what dirt you can dig up. I'm going to cyberstalk some names and see where that leads...or to who.

**Optional Conversation with David***Max can only talk to David in the garage if she sided with him; otherwise, he will not be found there.*

**David: **Anything I can do for you, Max?

**Max: **I... I was just waiting for Chloe to get out of the bathroom, so we can go.

**David: **I owe you one, so I'll pretend what you just said is true, missy.

**Max: **Excuse me, that's Miss Caulfield.

**David: **Yes, sir. You and Chloe still better be careful where you wander. There are a lot of dark places in Arcadia Bay.

**Max: **What do you mean by "dark places"?

**David: **I can't tell you everything that's going on at Blackwell. And you've seen too much already. So, please stay out of this, Max.

**Max: **Too late. I already know way too much.

**David:** That guy is an elitist prick. Now, I'm off-duty, so I can say it at home behind his back. Like when Chloe calls me "step-douche." These "artists" live in a fantasy world.

Why say that?Why say that?**Max:** Why do you say that?

**David:** These art-farts are all about themselves. When I was in the service, I hated the photographers who'd try to pose me in their anti-war bullshit.

**Max:** Well, Blackwell Academy is a school for artists, so maybe this isn't the best place for you.

**David:** I have a family here, Max. And I think Blackwell is the best place for me, since only I know what's happening.

(Signed Ms. Grant's petition)(Signed Ms. Grant's petition)**David:** Of course, thanks to Ms Grant and her hippie anti-surveillance petition, I hope everybody feels safer... like Rachel Amber and Kate Marsh.

**Max:** Chloe and I can take care of ourselves.

**David:** Now excuse me, Max, I have to get back to my camera. See, I'm an artist, too.

**David: **Sorry, Max, I can't talk and work.

'''Max's Thoughts About Investigating David's Lockers**

**Max (thinking): **I better go scope out those lockers.

**Max (thinking): '''I can't leave until I search through David's garage.

**Max (thinking): **There's no way I can go to Chloe without going to David's locker.

''Max looks at the lockers in David's Garage.''

**Max (thinking): **Whoa, that is a serious padlock on that locker. Hey, David, whatcha hidin'?

*There are several ways Max can open the lockers.*

*If Max remembers the code from Episode 3 (7171), she can input it into the lockers.*

**Max (thinking): **Oh yes, I knew that number would be important.

*After one or more failed attempts at unlocking the padlock or after pressing "back," Max can find another way to open the lockers.*

(Sided with David)(Sided with David)

**Max (thinking): **''For once, I don't have time to search for the code... I need to find a key.*

*Max tries to take the keys from the desk in front of David.*

**David: **Excuse me, Max! Do not touch one goddamn thing!

**Max (thinking): ***Come on, Max, find a way to get David out of his cave...*

*Max tampers with the fuse box in the back of the garage, next to the door leading to the foyer.*

**Max (thinking): ***I can't let David see me while I snag his keys. Enter the ninja...*

**David: **Son of a bitch, I just fixed that fuse box!

**Chloe (from upstairs): **Shit. Somebody fix the fuse!

*Max enters the door next to the fuse box. She returns to the other entrance to the garage and takes David's keys from the table.*

**Max (thinking): ***Gotcha!*

*Max rewinds to before she tampered with the fuse box. She uses the keys on the padlock.*

**Max (thinking): ***I am the Keymaster!*

|-|(Sided with Chloe)# (Sided with Chloe)**Max (thinking):** *For once, I don't have time to search for the code... I need to find a way to break this padlock.*

*Max takes the crowbar from the table.*

**Max (thinking):** *Okay, I can use that crowbar to pry open the locker.*

*Max uses the crowbar to break the padlock off the locker.*

**Max (thinking):** *Sorry, David, but I bet you would do the same thing as me.*

*Max searches through the contents of the locker.*

**Max (thinking): **Whoa... Maps, notes, coordinates, photos of Kate, Nathan... Oh, yes!

*Max closes the locker after rifling through the files.*

**Max (thinking): **Score! Back to Chloe now.

*If Max goes through the living room on her way to Chloe (and sided with David):*

**Max (thinking): **I give up William, but defend David... Would Chloe hate me if she knew?

*Max goes to the bottom of the stairs and calls out to Chloe.''

**Max: **Yo, Chloe, are you ready yet? I have to get back to my dorm!

**Chloe: **Are we happy?

**Max: **Very happy. I hit the secret file jackpot. Kate, Nathan, and Rachel. Plus, there's some location coordinates. David is, like, a one-man surveillance army. Now let's get the hell out of here, before we get busted.

(Saved Kate)(Saved Kate)**Max:** But I absolutely have to go see Kate in the hospital right now. I want to find out how she's doing.

|-|(Couldn't save Kate)# (Couldn't save Kate)**Chloe:** Now let's go find out what Nathan is hiding in his room.

**Max:** We have to be extra careful.

**Chloe:** Max, now it's time for Nathan Prescott to be afraid of us.

*The two girls get in the truck and drive away.*

###  **Hospital** 
*If Max saved Kate, she and Chloe are shown entering a hallway in a hospital.*

**Max: **This is definitely Kate's floor.

**Chloe: **Hospitals always freak me out.

**Max: **I hear you. But imagine how Kate feels... I'm so glad I get to see her again. I hope it's not too weird for her.

**Chloe: **No, she'll be stoked to see you. Who wouldn't be?

''Max and Chloe reach the door to Kate's hospital room.''

**Max: **This be it. I'm a little nervous...

**Chloe: **Just go in there and be her friend. I'll wait out here so you can chill by yourselves.

*Chloe sits in a chair against the wall.*

(Answered Kate's call)(Answered Kate's call)**Chloe:** I was a total dick for blowing a fuse when you answered Kate's call the other day. Good thing you ignored me. I had no idea what shit she was going through. And you saved her... like me.

**Max: **Thanks, Chloe, but don't be sorry. We're all on the same team.

**Chloe: **Team Max. Let Kate know we're gonna string Nathan up by his balls then.

**Max: **Oh, yes. I'm on it.

*Max enters the room. Kate is sitting on a chair, drawing. She sees Max and the two smile at each other. Kate jumps up and gives Max a hug.*

**Kate: **Max!

**Max: **Oh, Kate!

**Kate: **I thought I'd never see you again. I feel so ridiculous... I'm so sorry.

**Max: **Kate, listen to me... you have nothing to be sorry about. Other people do. You do not know how happy I am to see you. You look awesome. Is it a stupid question if I ask how you're doing?

**Kate: **Now that you're here, I'm doing even better. I'm so grateful to you for coming up to the roof to talk me down... Max, I felt so lost and alone... but when I saw how much you cared, how hard you were trying... you made me realize I wasn't alone. Thank you.

**Max: **Kate, there are so many people who love you and want to help you.

**Kate: **I know, you should see all the letters and postcards. I gave most of the flowers to other patients here because they need them more than me. I'm keeping the balloons, though. One of the nurses gave me some pen and paper so I could do some drawings.

*Kate sits down again and resumes drawing.*

**Max: **I love your illustrations.

**Kate: **They got kind of dark there for a while, but I have an idea for a new children's book about bullying... I was thinking about having some photographs in there too.

**Max: **I hope that's a subtle hint that you'll let me take the photographs for the book...

**Kate: **Was that subtle? You better take the pictures, Max. I'm going to be here for another day until my family comes out to visit.

**Max: **How are they treating you?

**Kate: **Like they need to protect me forever. They're so upset and I know they feel guilty, even though they didn't do anything. I was surprised how many students from Blackwell wrote me. Daniel, Mr. Jefferson... Even Victoria wrote me a very sweet note... and I believe she was being real.

**Max: **Me too. I'm glad you believe again, Kate.

**Kate: **I'm working on it, Max. I just pray I can get this drawing right...

**Chloe: **Damn, Max, you're finally back. I got worried... So, what did you find?

**Max: **His room was clean and...creepy. Check this out...

''Max gives Nathan's phone to Chloe.*

**Chloe: **Boom, Nathan! We got you by the balls, fucker.

*Nathan enters the Boys' Dormitories, surprised and enraged to see Chloe and Max.*

**Nathan: **What are you doing in my dorm?!

*Max and Chloe start to back away.''

**Nathan: **You're such a nosy bitch, Max!

**Max: **Stop right there, Nathan!

**Nathan: **Make me, ho!

*Nathan steps toward Max and Chloe. Chloe grabs him by the shoulders. Warren suddenly appears and pushes Nathan backward.*

**Warren: **Max, I got this!

**Nathan: **Get the fuck outta my face!

''Warren grabs Nathan's shoulders and headbutts him. Warren holds his head and groans in pain. Max gasps and covers her mouth with her hands.*

**Nathan: **You are so fucking dead--!

*Nathan reaches for his gun, but Warren kicks it out of his hands, then kicks Nathan in the stomach. Max gasps again.*

**Nathan: **Get off me, brah!

*Warren kicks Nathan a few more times.*

STAY OUT OF IT# STAY OUT OF IT*Max says nothing as Warren continues to kick Nathan.*

**Warren:** You like to hurt people, huh? Like Max? Like Kate? Like me? Huh? Feel this, motherfucker!

*Warren repeatedly punches Nathan in the face.*

**Nathan:** Get...off me... Please...please stop!

*Warren gets up. Nathan turns over and holds his head in his hands.''

**Max:** He's down! Hey...come on...

*Warren leaves.*

**Nathan:** Stop... Sorry...

*Chloe reaches down and takes the gun lying on the ground.*

**Chloe:** Yes, we have to go!

*Chloe leans down toward Nathan.*

**Chloe:** Who's the bitch now?

**Max:** Chloe!

*Chloe leaves.*

**Max (thinking):** *Damn, Warren went full alpha on Nathan...and it was good. But...scary...*

'''Nathan's comments:**

**Nathan: **Shit, man...this really hurts...

**Nathan: **Everybody hates me....everybody...

**Nathan: '*I think my face is broken...

|-|STOP WARRENSTOP WARREN*Max runs to Warren and pulls him off Nathan.''

**Max:** Warren, stop it! Come on.

**Nathan:** Oh! Ow, my head... Why are you all looking at me like that, huh?! You, and you, you're all dead!

*Nathan grabs his gun and gets up.*

**Chloe:** Let's go. Now!

*Chloe and Warren leave.*

**Nathan:** Plus, my dad is on his way! You're all fucked! He owns you!

*Nathan leaves around the corner.*

**Max (thinking):** *Even if Nathan definitely deserved a beating...we should try to be better than that.*

''Max leaves the Boys' Dormitories.''

###  **Main Campus** 
**Max: **Damn, that was intense. Warren...thank you so much.

**Warren: **For what?

Stayed out of it# Stayed out of it**Chloe:** For beating the shit out of Nathan Prescott! Dude, you rule.

**Warren:** I don't know. I kinda went crazy there...like Nathan.

|-|Stopped WarrenStopped Warren**Chloe:** For headbutting Nathan Prescott! That was awesome!

**Warren:** I don't know. I almost went crazy there...like Nathan.

**Max: **You're not anything like him.

**Warren: **Good to know. So, where are you going? I better stick with you guys. Just in case you need me to get my Hulk on again. Or should I call the cops on Nathan?

**Max: **No police. Not yet. Uh...so maybe you better...um...

**Chloe: **Warren, me and Max have to do this on our own. No offense.

**Warren: **It's cool. Whatever I can do to help...

**Max: **What you can do is find out anything you can about Nathan's father.

**Warren: **I'm on it. Between the snow and eclipse, I'm assuming the apocalypse is around the corner...

**Max: **And...thank you. Seriously. I'll call you later.

**Warren: **You better. I'm feeling pretty alpha now.

**Max: **Yes. You are.

*Warren leaves.*

**Chloe: **Man, that guy is so fucking in love with you.

**Max: **I know...

**Chloe: **He really did give a serious beatdown to Nathan.

**Max: **It was a little scary to watch him do that...

**Chloe: **Now let's make a date with Frank.

**Max: **Will he even answer you?

**Chloe: **Frank always answers when he wants money.

*Chloe takes out her phone and texts Frank. Her phone dings as Frank replies immediately.*

**Chloe: **Like I said, Frank wants to see me right now.

**Max: **Let's not keep him waiting...

*Max and Chloe leave the Main Campus.*

###  **Beach** 
''Max and Chloe drive up to the beach where Frank's RV is parked.*

**Max:** God... I hate seeing those poor whales like that.

**Chloe:** Me too. I just think of their families out there in the ocean looking for them. Well, that asshole is gonna help us find Rachel.

(Chloe has a gun)# (Chloe has a gun)*Chloe will use David's gun if Frank doesn't have it. She will use Nathan's gun if she took it from him and Frank has David's gun.''

**Max:** Or what? You'll actually shoot him? Chloe, do not count on my rewind... seriously.

**Chloe:** Obviously I'm not counting on you. That's why I have a gun. And I might even save you someday.

**Max:** About time.

**Chloe:** I am so going to hit you.

|-|(Chloe doesn't have a gun)(Chloe doesn't have a gun)**Chloe:** You know what would be great? If I still had a gun.

**Max:** Yes, the chance for gunplay would just about even the odds here.

**Chloe:** Frank would scare better. He's a pussy. Besides, if I take him out, you can just rewind...

**Max:** Chloe, do not count on my rewind... seriously. After Kate, I feel like every time I do it might be the last...

**Chloe:** There's no way we could have guessed this is what would happen to us when we grew up.

**Max:** I'm looking forward to the day when we can just go on a road trip to Portland.

**Chloe:** Fuck yeah. You, me... and Rachel.

**Max:** Absolutely. So, let's play this cool, okay?

(Left the money)# (Left the money)**Max:** Just talk to Frank so we can get that code for the book from him. That's all.

|-|(Stole the money)(Stole the money)**Max:** Just pay Frank his money and then we can get that code for the book from him. That's all.

'''Max's Thoughts About the Beach**

**Max *(thinking)*:'* *It blows my mind that I was just here with Chloe in an alternate reality...''

**Negotiation with Frank**

(Max didn't rewind)# (Max didn't rewind)*Max approaches Chloe. She nods toward the RV door and Chloe knocks.*

|-|(Max rewound the whole scene)(Max rewound the whole scene)**Max:** Listen, Chloe, I can tell you for a fact that this will not go well.

**Chloe:** Max, I should have known you would be kind and rewind... So tell me exactly what I need to do here.

{{#tag:tabber|Get rid of gun. (If Chloe has a gun)# Get rid of gun. (If Chloe has a gun)**Max:** You won't like this, but you need to get rid of that gun.

**Chloe:** No, Max, I don't like that at all... but I trust you. And girl, if I need that gun, you better rewind fast...

''Chloe knocks on Frank's RV door.*

*Frank opens the door and gets out of his RV.''

**Frank:** Oh, look... The Wonder Twins. You should have come alone.

**Chloe:** She's my partner.

*Max investigates the new clues on the board.*

'*Max *(thinking)*:*' Hmmm, let's see if I can find any deal Frank made with Nathan or the Vortex Club.

*Max takes the papers that mention Nathan.*

|-|(David's clues)# (David's clues)

'*Max *(thinking)*:*' And that’s all she wrote. Please let me find some clues about Nathan in here…

*Max investigates the new clues on the board.*

'*Max *(thinking)*:*' Great, now how do I find out which car is Nathan’s to match the coordinates?

**Chloe:** Aye aye, captain.

|-|(Frank is dead)# (Frank is dead)

**Max:** Now we're finally getting somewhere. Chloe, I need you to go online and help me decipher this. Chloe?

**Max:** Chloe... Chloe, please listen... I know this is awful, but we're in it together, okay? I didn't have your back and I let you down. Please don't cry...

**Chloe:** Max... I'm going to go to the police after we find Rachel. I can't live keeping this a secret... and I don't want to be a teenage fugitive on the run. And dude, I swear I won't even mention you, okay? This is all me.

**Max:** Chloe, it was self-defense. I know you're hurting, but you have to just block out everything and keep moving forward. Rachel is waiting.

**Chloe:** Okay... you're right. Focus on Rachel. It's all about Rachel now. Okay.

**Max:** We will. I know this week has been so weird and fucked up, but Chloe... this has to be our destiny. Or at least one of them. Let's just find out where this is all going to end, okay? For Rachel... for Kate.

**Chloe:** And for Frank. He was dragged into this bullshit, too.

**Max:** That's my Chloe. Now let's be a lean, mean, research team. You have to go online and help decipher these coordinates... because they might finally lead us to Rachel.

**Chloe:** Let me dig up some more clues here.

*Chloe tries looking up info about the barn. ''

**Chloe:** Nope... Nothing, Max. There's nothing here. Just some shitty old barn...

**Max:** Let's keep searching and find out who owns this haunted barn.

**Chloe:** I'm on this, hold on.

*Chloe searches the barn.*

**Chloe:** Somebody named—"Harry Aaron Prescott."

**Max:** I'm shocked. Should we call the police?

**Chloe:** Fuck that. You know the police here are like Nathan's private security, right?

**Max:** That's so messed up...

**Chloe:** As you've noticed, this whole town is messed up. We can't trust anybody... Except each other. So we have to go out to that farmhouse by ourselves.

**Max:** I was afraid you'd say that. We could call Warren, since he kicked Nathan's ass...

**Chloe:** It's just the two of us. Nobody else. And I'm not scared at all. You have the power. I feel like we're this close to finding Rachel... We have to find her, Max.

**Max:** We will. But remember, my power isn't infinite. We still have to be careful. Do you hear, Chloe?

**Chloe:** Yes, sir.

''Max and Chloe leave Chloe's room to find the barn. Chloe's computer remains on, showing a map and the coordinates of the barn.*

*Max bends down to examine tire tracks.*

**Max:** Whoa, check this out. Fresh tire tracks.

**Chloe:** Dude, somebody was just here.

**Max:** Then we need to get in that barn...

'''Chloe's comments**

**Chloe:'* Max, get over here before I torch this place!

*Max goes around to the side of the barn and moves a metal sheet, revealing another entrance.''

**Max:** Chloe! I found the front door! Come on!

**Chloe:** Oh yes! Maximus rules!

**Max:** God, this is way too Blair Witch... I have goose bumps all over.

**Chloe:** Come on, Super Max. Hey, check out this old chest!

**Max:** A little louder, Chloe! Jeez, that is ancient.

**Chloe:** Jackpot. Old shit.

**Max:** No, look closer.

**Chloe:** "Harry Aaron Prescott and family donate new library to Arcadia Bay"... "Prescott Industries celebrate grand opening"... "The Prescotts bring bomb shelter boom to town."

**Max:** Nice scrapbook. You search for more clues and I'll scope out the area.

'*Max *(thinking)*:*' ''Yes, old Prescott clippings, but that can't be the only thing here.*

*'Chloe's comments**

**Chloe: '*Boring... boring...

*Max walks to the other side of the barn and searches the ground, revealing a hatch.*

*'Max *(thinking)*:'* *Whoa, what is this? It's totally brand new. Why?*

*Max attaches a nearby hook to the padlock. She walks over to a platform and attempts to climb onto it.*

**Max:** Chloe, can you give me a hand?

**Chloe:** Sidekick at your service! Up, up and away, Super Max.

**Max:** I dig having minions.

*Max pulls the old motor down from the platform above her, steps onto it, and climbs to the next platform. She then rewinds until the motor is back in place, then attaches a nearby rope to it. She pulls the motor, which comes crashing down, pulling up the padlock.*

*'Max *(thinking)*:'* *MaxGyver strikes again!*

*Max jumps back down to the ground floor and walks back over to the hatch.*

**Max:** Damn, this is heavy...

*Max and Chloe open the hatch to reveal a staircase.*

**Chloe:** What... is this?

**Max:** Jackpot. Do I even need to say how weird this is?

**Chloe:** You just did. Who builds this kind of place?

**Max:** A Prescott, of course.

*'Max *(thinking)*:'* *This bunker is so surreal.*

*Max enters the grayed-out numbers, 542, into the keypad.*

**Max:** Oh yes! I thought that only worked in the movies! Open sesame.

**Chloe:** Stocked and ready for the apocalypse. This must have cost a fortune. Come on.

*'Max *(thinking)*:'* *Now what the hell is this...*

*'Chloe's comments**

**Chloe: **Everything is sketchy as fuck, but nothing about Rachel here.

**Chloe: '*Can you imagine chilling in this room?

*Max opens the cupboard to reveal rows of red binders. She takes out the binders labeled "Rachel," "Kate," and "Victoria" and puts them on the desk.''

**Chloe:** Come on, let's see what this shit is all about.

**Max:** We are. Okay, a binder marked "Victoria," but it's empty...

**Chloe:** Look, the next one says "Kate."

**Max:** Oh no, Kate... No...

**Chloe:** God, I should have killed that bastard back there.

**Max:** Kate wasn't the first... All those binders are filled with other victims. Victoria has to be next. Nathan must be planning to dose her tonight at the Vortex Club party.

**Chloe:** Rachel... This can't be real... These are all--these are all posed shots, right? Right?

**Max:** Chloe. Look at her face. She's... out of it.

**Chloe:** Maybe--maybe Nathan paid her a shitload of cash to do this. She probably would have.

**Max:** I don't think so. Why is he putting her in the ground like that? Where--

**Chloe:** The junkyard! Max, we have to find that spot, now! Then we can see what he did... There's no way she's dead. No way! She posed for those pictures, Max. I know it, please... let's go.

'*Max *(thinking)*:*' *Oh my God... Rachel... Kate... all these files...*

### **Junkyard**

''Max runs back to Chloe's truck and they drive to the junkyard. Chloe brings her truck to a stop, opens her door, and runs. Max follows.''

**Max:** Chloe, slow down! Wait for me!

**Chloe:** I know exactly where I'm going!

''Chloe runs to the corner of the junkyard near the Steve's Famous Crab sign.*

**Chloe: **Look, this is it! This is it!

*Chloe begins to dig with her hands.*

**Chloe: **Are you going to help me, Max?

**Max: **Chloe, stop! Look!

**Chloe: **Please, no...

**Max: **That smell...

**Chloe: **Rachel... Oh, Rachel, no, no! Please, not her!

*Max covers her mouth with her hands as she watches Chloe's reaction. Chloe moves a few feet away and begins to gag. Max runs over to Chloe and puts one hand on her shoulder and another hand on her back, trying to comfort her.''

**Max: **Chloe...

**Chloe: **Rachel... why?

**Max: **I'm sorry, Chloe. I'm so sorry...

''Chloe hugs her knees to her chest, sobbing, and covers her face with her hand. Max puts her hands on Chloe's shoulders and hugs her.*

**Chloe: **I loved her so much... How can she be dead? What kind of world does this? Who does this?

*A spiritual deer watches them from across the junkyard. Gradually, it fades away.*

### **Parking Lot**

*Max and Chloe sit in the truck.''

**Chloe: **I hope Nathan enjoys his last party.

**Max: **Chloe, we can go right to the cops. We have proof.

**Chloe: **Fuck the police. Rachel wanted us to find her. So we could get real justice... and revenge. The Prescotts have had this coming for a hundred years, and nobody is going to get in my way. Especially with your help... right?

**Max: **I'm with you to the end, Chloe. You know that.

*Chloe looks down at her gun and puts it in her back pocket. They get out of the car.*

**Boy: **Oh, shit, this is like that eclipse.

**Girl: **You're right. Look at the outline.

**Boy: **I can't tell if they're different.

**Girl: **There can't be two moons... that's not possible...

*Max looks up at the sky to see two moons.*

**Max: **What is that? Jesus, Chloe, look up at the sky!

**Chloe: **Beautiful, I don't give a shit. The world is ending, cool.

**Max: **You're not listening! Something major is going down!

**Chloe: **That's right. Nathan Prescott is going down.

*Chloe and Max start to walk towards the building. Warren stops them.*

**Warren: **Welcome to the end of the world, ladies. I'm glad you decided to escort me...

**Max: **You look really good, Warren. Are you all right after today?

**Chloe: **Where is he?

**Warren: **I didn't see him at the dorm again. I was holed up in my room.

**Max: **Dude, have you been drinking?

**Warren: **Well, if you consider half a beer "drinking"...

**Chloe: **Let's go, Max.

**Warren: **Hey, hey... I know this is a bad time, but can I get one picture? I've been feeling like this might be actually the end of the world, so... I want to have something for prosperity.

**Warren: **I know, I know, I'm a pain in the booty. Just one picture. Uh...

''Warren uses Max's camera to take a polaroid of the two of them together.''

**Chloe: **We got no time for this shit. Come on, Max.

**Warren: **Sorry... I just wanted to feel like a normal student after this week's ultraviolence. I never hit anybody like that before... I was always the one getting my ass kicked.

**Stella:** He's a bully for one thing and he hit Warren for another... But have you ever looked at his eyes? Glazed and raging. Me no like.

|-|What girl?# What girl?**Max:** What girl?

**Stella:** She had blue hair, dressed like a punk... I've seen her putting up those Rachel Amber posters. I'm stuck here, so I'm sorry I can't help you.

**Max: **So why are you working at a Vortex Club party? I didn't think you wanted to be a member.

**Stella: **Screw that. I'm here for the job.

Who hired you?Who hired you?**Max:** Who hired you?

**Stella:** Mr. Jefferson asked me because he knows I don't have a lot of money, even with my job and scholarship. I'm not cool enough for this school.

|-|Anything unusual?# Anything unusual?**Max:** Do you notice anything unusual about the Vortex Club tonight?

**Stella:** Yeah, I notice they don't give a shit about Kate Marsh. I'm glad for the job, but I think Principal Wells should have canceled the party. Guess I'm not cool enough.

**Max: **Yes, you are, Stella. You're smart, honest, and you bust your ass for Blackwell. I hope everything turns out your way in the end.

**Stella: **Awww, thank you, Max. I really appreciate that. Hey, your face looks so intense... are you okay?

**Max: **Um, no, I'm actually not okay. I... I just need to find Nathan. And don't get too close if you see him.

**Stella: **Hell no. This is homework, not a party. I'll text you if I spy him. Good luck.

'*Max* (thinking)*:*' *We need to find Nathan and take him down.*

### **Optional Conversation with Daniel**# 

*Only available if Max convinced Daniel to attend the party.*

**Max:** Hi, Daniel.

**Daniel:** Yes! Max makes an entrance! I only came to the party because of you!

**Max:** I'm glad to see you out and about. By the way, have you seen Nathan Prescott tonight?

**Daniel:** No, I've been hanging with Brooke since I got here. Max, are you okay? Your face looks so... serious.

I know.I know.

**Max:** I know. I'm not in party mode tonight.

**Daniel:** You look like you're on a secret mission...

|-|It's nothing.# It's nothing.

**Max:** It's nothing. Just residue from all the Blackwell drama...

**Daniel:** It seems like it never ends, huh?

**Max:** This is where it's going to end... for Rachel's sake.

(Max has a date with Warren)(Max has a date with Warren)

**Daniel:** Oh, Max. You need a Blackwell break. I'm taking Brooke to a Miyazaki show in Portland if you want to come along... the more the merrier!

|-|(Brooke has a date with Warren)# (Brooke has a date with Warren)

**Daniel:** Well, if you want to hang out with Brooke and me, we're here for you.

**Max:** Thanks, Daniel. I have to stay on my mission now. I hope you stay on yours and become a great artist.

**Daniel:** Well, I'll be celebrating someday in a museum, Max. Adios.

### **Optional Conversation with Brooke**# 

**Max:** Hello, Brooke.

**Brooke:** Max, I didn't expect to see you at a Vortex Club party.

**Max:** I didn't expect that either, but I really need to find Nathan. Have you...

**Brooke:** No, I haven't seen him. And I'm not looking for him, so I most likely won't tonight. I just hate that scrub... and his club.

Not the only one.Not the only one.

**Max:** You're not the only one. Maybe this party will be the "End Of The Vortex Club"...

**Brooke:** Then I don't have to pretend like I care anymore.

|-|Why are you here?# Why are you here?

**Max:** So why are you here tonight?

**Brooke:** No homework. Boredom. Waiting.

**Brooke:** No, I was talking to Daniel... he asked me to go with him to the Portland Art Museum this weekend...

**Max:** Oh, that is so sweet. I bet Daniel will be a great museum guide...

**Brooke:** I'm more into science than art, but what kind of a selfish fangirl would miss a Miyazaki exhibition?

{{!}}-{{!}}(Daniel didn't attend the party)(Daniel didn't attend the party)

**Brooke:** Why? You're the one going out with him.

**Max:** Brooke, enough. I'm sorry Warren asked me to the movies, but you don't need to give me an attitude. I'd like to think I'm your friend.

**Brooke:** I know... I get salty when things don't go my way. I'm selfish, while you go on a roof to help save your friend.

{{#tag:tabber|(Daniel attended the party)(Daniel attended the party)

**Brooke:** No, but we're going to map out our drive-in date later. I was just talking to Daniel about a road trip next week to the Portland Art Museum.

**Brooke:** I'm more into science than art, but what kind of a selfish fangirl would miss a Miyazaki exhibition?

{{!}}-{{!}}(Daniel didn't attend the party)# (Daniel didn't attend the party)

**Brooke:** I will. He left already, but we're going to map out our drive-in date later. Warren wants to go to dinner first, so that'll be fun. Is that cool with you, Max?

**Max:** Yes, it's great. Brooke, I'm happy for you. And Warren. I'd like to see you happy instead of waiting.

**Brooke:** Thanks, Max. Though I feel selfish talking about a boy, considering Kate and the Arcadia Bay eco-meltdown...

}}

**Max:** You're not selfish, Brooke. You're just trying to live your life without all this bullshit. Like all of us here...

**Brooke:** You seem so wise and... kind of invincible this week. I think that snow and eclipse gave you superpowers. Check to see if you can fly.

Double moon.Double moon.

**Max:** Only with your drone. By the way, did you see that crazy double moon out there earlier?

**Brooke:** Max, if I saw a double moon out there, I would assume it really was the end of the world.

|-|Superpowers.# Superpowers.

**Max:** I don't think having superpowers would make my life easier... with great power comes great bullshit.

**Brooke:** I don't know. It would be pretty kick-ass to battle supervillains over Arcadia Bay...

**Max:** Well, the night is still young, Brooke.

**Brooke:** And so are we, Max. So let's plan a drone date next week.

### **Optional Conversation with Luke**# 

**Max:** Luke, I almost didn't see you.

**Luke:** Max, you're the only person I don't mind seeing right now.

**Max:** I was looking for Nathan...

**Luke:** I've avoided almost everybody here tonight. Uh, why are you looking for Nathan?

No big deal.No big deal.

**Max:** No big deal.

**Luke:** Really? You look pretty fucking intense. Is Nathan bothering you?

|-|Dangerous.# Dangerous.

**Max:** I wanted to make sure he's not going to... do anything tonight.

**Luke:** Like what happened to Kate...

(Warren beat up Nathan)(Warren beat up Nathan)

**Luke:** Oh wait, I did see Nathan today, nursing a busted face. I had dreams that somebody finally kicked his ass...

**Max:** Luke, sometimes dreams come true. Warren gave him an epic beatdown.

|-|(Warren didn't beat up Nathan)# (Warren didn't beat up Nathan)

**Luke:** I have dreams that somebody finally kicks his ass one day.

**Max:** Luke, sometimes dreams come true. Today I saw Warren give Nathan an epic headbutt.

**Luke:** Yes! Give it up for brother Warren! Now all we have to do is drive all these goddamn Prescott vampires out of town.

Sean Prescott.Sean Prescott.

**Max:** I think Sean Prescott wants to drive all of us out of town... or into Pan Estates.

**Luke:** I met him once at a Bigfoots game... mean fucking bastard. Oh man, he explains Nathan.

|-|Vortex Club.# Vortex Club.

**Max:** That will be hard to do when the Prescotts own the town... and the Vortex Club.

**Luke:** I call it the "Vortex Cult." Look at this crap... dress code? VIP section? Elitist bullshit.

**Max:** Preach it, brother Luke. Okay, I have to get going. Thanks for seeing me...

**Luke:** No, thank you. For helping Kate. And for keeping it real. Peace out.

{{!}}-{{!}}(Warned in a previous episode)(Warned in a previous episode)

Kate.Kate.

{{#tag:tabber|(Kate died)# (Kate died)

**Max:** I'm surprised to see anybody here, considering that Kate just killed herself in front of everybody.

**Alyssa:** I know. I only came because Warren was coming and I needed something else to vent about. This party is such a tribute to Kate's spirit.

{{!}}-{{!}}(Kate lived)(Kate lived)

**Max:** I'm surprised that Blackwell is having a party after Kate almost jumped off a roof. I guess people are happy that Kate is "okay" now and they can party again...

**Alyssa:** I'm just happy she's drawing again. She seems much better and her mother is being so supportive for a change... Kate deserves that.

}}
{{#tag:tabber|Viral Video.# Viral Video.

**Max:** I saw that the video got taken down, so I hope nobody posts it anywhere else... or is that naive?

{{!}}-{{!}}Revenge.Revenge.

**Max:** Kate deserves revenge. We have to make sure this doesn't happen to anybody else at Blackwell... 

**Alyssa:** I can tell you know some serious shit by your face. You don't have to tell me now, but please let me know if I can help. Like you helped me.

}}

|-|Nathan.# Nathan.

**Max:** Alyssa, I have to find Nathan. Have you seen him?

**Alyssa:** I really don't know, but surely in the VIP section... like it's a New York club.

**Max:** Thanks, Alyssa. Watch out for yourself.

**Alyssa:** Why, when I have Max Caulfield at my side? Good luck.

*Max automatically leaves the conversation.*

|-|Vortex Club.Vortex Club.

**Max:** Look at this... I'm at my first and only Vortex Club party.

*Only available if Max warned Alyssa in every episode.*

**Max:** I'm so glad I could warn you about all those sneak attacks.

**Alyssa:** You kinda are a superhero. You always choose to help me. It reminds me of the only poem I can quote, by Robert Frost.

{{#tag:tabber|Tell me now.Tell me now.

**Max:** I could use one moment of poetry right now.

**Alyssa:** Okay, but this is like poet karaoke, so don't cringe: "I shall be telling this with a sigh. Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I... I took the one less traveled by. And that has made all the difference."

**Max:** That was beautiful, Alyssa. And it's exactly what I needed to hear.

**Alyssa:** Thanks for not cringing. And thanks for watching my back. Blackwell would be so much cooler if we all did that for everybody else... but you're a great start, Max.

*Max automatically leaves the conversation.*

{{!}}-{{!}}Tell me later.# Tell me later.

Rachel.# Rachel.

**Max:** Rachel Amber won't be coming either.

**Justin:** Damn, I was thinking about Rachel and Chloe tonight... If they showed up together right now, shit would end. Rachel could always shut Victoria down.

**Max:** Good for Rachel. I wish I could have seen that...

|-|Nathan.Nathan.

**Max:** Speaking of... have you seen Nathan?

**Justin:** Oh, he should be freaking out in the VIP lounge with that Whore-tex Club. Fucking hate those snobby douchebags... especially Nathan. That dude is gonna go on a rampage soon.

**Max:** You might be right. So stay away from him tonight, okay? Spread the word.

|-|Dana.# Dana.

**Max:** You're obviously not cool with Trevor dating Dana.

**Justin:** I tried to front like I was, but when I saw them together, I came over to cry like a little bitch.

**Max:** No, it's more like somebody who's in pain. I'm sorry, Justin. But you're a cool, considerate guy and you're going to find somebody just as cool, minus the drama.

**Justin:** Max, I know I'm twisted, but your face looks so fucking intense. And your voice sounds... different. You okay? How about a quick dab?

**Max:** Uh, no. I—I'm cool, Justin. And I have to get going. Maybe you should go chill somewhere else.

**Justin:** Fucking A, Maximus! You're right. I'm only torturing myself here. Plus I'm too loaded... It's time to get my board and grind.

**Max:** Hey, Courtney, how are you?

(Courtney wrote Max's name on the list)(Courtney wrote Max's name on the list)

**Courtney:** Max! Our guest star arrives fashionably late! Say “Bonsoir” to the “End of the World”! Even though you flaked on my party make-over...You still get special access to the Vortex Club VIP lounge…

**Max:** You better let your minion know since she won't let me pass.

**Courtney:** Oh, that little asshole just made her last mistake. She thinks she’s Victoria. Buh bye. Now, let’s go make an official VIP entrance, Max Factor! Get it… ?

**Courtney:** Hey Sarah, do you know that I personally put Max’s name on the list? So you like, decide to block her from coming in while I’m taking a break? You’re not in charge here.

**Sarah:** Wait, I just... I…

**Courtney:** Oh my God, you’re done. And you’re off the list, permanently. Welcome to the Vortex Club.

|-|(Max wrote her name on the list)# (Max wrote her name on the list)

**Courtney:** You got on the list? That’s very…unlikely but let’s check it out. Follow me…

**Courtney:** Sarah, our friend Max here claims she’s on the list. Just for shits and giggles, let’s see.

**Courtney:** No way…

**Max:** Yes, way. That’s my name right there...

**Courtney:** Oh. My. God. Do you think I’m that dumb, Max? That’s not even my handwriting and I’m in charge of the list! Victoria is right, you are so fucking weird! Well, this is the closest you will ever get to the Vortex Club again. Promise. Yes, you can leave now, Max. The party’s over.

**Max:** This is bigger than a problem child.

**Victoria:** I'm not perfect, okay? I'm a teenager at an art school. I'm only here to become a photographer and get famous.

**Max:** I don't blame you, Victoria, but you know Kate had a church group and that she didn't party. So why did you send out that video?

**Victoria:** Oh God... I swear we weren't even going to do it. Then we had some wine and got stupid.

**Max:** More than stupid. It's mean... hateful. Kate never did anything to you. And that didn't stop you from taking one last video of her on the roof.

{{#tag:tabber|(Kate died)# (Kate died)

**Victoria:** I deleted that from my phone. Max, I saw Kate Marsh die... I swear it didn't feel real to me. I kept thinking, "Did I cause this? Did I?" I've felt like shit ever since.

**Victoria:** You saw me talking to him?

**Max:** Saw... and heard.

**Victoria:** We were just talking about how excited he is for the "Everyday Heroes" contest. That doesn't mean I'm going to win or anything.

**Max:** I hope you win fair.

**Victoria:** We'll see...And Max, I know you don't like me either, so it's not like we have to be friends or anything.

**Max:** Your photographs suck, Victoria. You make fun of my selfies, but most of your photos are basically headshots. I don't think Richard Avedon has anything to worry about.

**Victoria:** Oh, you did not just say that. I can't wait to see you choke when Mr. Jefferson selects my incredible photo for the "Everyday Heroes" contest.

**Max:** Uh, yeah, I saw you try to blackmail Mr. Jefferson last night because you're so incredible. That was so pathetic, Victoria.

Not enemies.Not enemies.

**Max:** Maybe, but who says we have to be enemies?

**Victoria:** Whoever makes that decision.

**Max:** That would be us, Victoria.

**Victoria:** Well, Max Caulfield, I could always choose to let you in the Vortex Club...

**Victoria:** Oh, you look so serious...

|-|Why not? (Determinant)# Why not? (Determinant)

**Victoria:** I almost asked you to hang out. You said my photos were "Avedon-esque." Then I remembered who I was...

**Max:** You should have asked me. It would have been cool to compare photo notes.

**Victoria:** Maybe we're too much alike...

**Max:** You might be right.

**Victoria:** Well, Max Caulfield, there's still time for you to get in the Vortex Club...

**Victoria:** What? Nice try, Max. But I don’t believe you. And why would he do that?

**Max:** That I don't know yet. But it was enough to make Kate want to die... And I think you're next.

**Victoria:** Max, that is crazy. Nathan is like one of my best friends. Yes, he takes serious meds, but that's not his fault. His family treats him like a total freak, just because he has little meltdowns.

**Max:** They’re not little anymore. They’re deadly. I don’t care if you hate me or not, but you have to believe me.

**Victoria:** You could have been a major bitch to me when I got hit with that paint... and I deserved it.

**Victoria:** Max, I don't hate you... I actually think you're one of the coolest people at Blackwell... Weird, but cool. You just don't know it yet. Maybe I'm jealous because you don't give a shit what anybody thinks. And I do.

**Victoria:** To be honest, Nathan has been freaking me out lately... He’s not here and I haven’t seen him.

**Max:** Just make sure you stay away from him and stick close to your friends tonight, okay?

**Victoria:** I'll let you boss me around this one time. And I have other people I can go to for protection. Thanks for telling me this, Max. If what you said is true... then you be careful, too.

### **Conversation with Chloe**# 

*Chloe enters through a door in the back of the VIP area and waits for Max.*

**Max:** There you are. Chloe, Nathan isn't here. Nobody has seen him tonight.

**Chloe:** He’s definitely not upstairs or in the lockers.

**Max:** Damn, maybe he's hiding in his dorm.

**Chloe:** Then let’s bail. Nathan can’t hide anymore.

*Max and Chloe start to walk towards the exit. Mr. Jefferson blocks them.*

**Mr. Jefferson:** So you made it, Max.

**Max:** Oh, hey, Mr. Jefferson...

**Mr. Jefferson:** Um... are you both okay? You look like you're on a mission...

**Max:** Oh, I was just looking for Nathan.

**Mr. Jefferson:** Aha. I didn't know you were pals with him. I haven't seen him since this afternoon... He seemed pretty upset. I think he's still quite upset over the whole Kate situation.

**Max:** Yeah, that makes sense.

**Mr. Jefferson:** Let's talk later, Max. I have to announce the winner of the contest. I do wish you would have entered. You have to build up that résumé and portfolio, but I know you will.

**Max:** Thanks, I hope so.

**Mr. Jefferson:** Okay, excuse me. I’m almost on...

**Chloe:** Let’s get the hell out of here, Max.

''Chloe puts her hand on Max's back and they leave the VIP area. Mr. Jefferson walks over to the DJ booth and takes the microphone.''

**Mr. Jefferson:** Okay, everybody calm down. Thank you, thank you... I appreciate it. I don't want to get in the way of the party, but it's time to announce the winner of the "Everyday Heroes" contest.

''Max stops to watch. Chloe, annoyed, grabs Max's wrist and unsuccessfully tries to pull her towards the exit.''

**Mr. Jefferson:** Before I do, I want to thank everybody who entered their photograph... and everybody who thought about entering. Now, this is the most important step in being an artist—sharing your work with the world. All of you represent Blackwell Academy, and everything our school stands for. As far as I'm concerned, you're all "Everyday Heroes"! The envelope, please... And the winner is… Oh my, what a shocker... Victoria Chase!

**Victoria:** Oh my God!

*Victoria takes the microphone from Mr. Jefferson.*

**Victoria:** Thank you so much, Mr. Jefferson. It was your incredible photography that brought me to Blackwell and I hope I can live up to your name... and fame. I also want to thank all the students for being so dedicated in their pursuit.

**Chloe:** Who fucking cares? Rachel is still dead. And I want Nathan's punk ass... now!

**Max:** Me too. Let’s go check out the dormitories.

*Max and Chloe leave the party. Once outside, Chloe gets a text from Nathan that says:*
**glad you got one last look at rachel**
**nobody will ever find her again after im done**

**Chloe:** Oh Christ, Nathan just texted me... He says there won't be any evidence left after he's done.

**Chloe: **It's weird hanging out with you again.

**Max: **I know... I'm glad we are, though.

**Chloe: **It was nice that you sent me actual letters. That's more than any of my other friends have done... And you even wrote on that cool parchment paper. That's so Max.

**Max: **So pretentious. But I love writing on it, like an English poet. You deserve the best stationery.

**Chloe: **Probably easier to write than to visit me. I don't mean that in a bitchy way. Not totally. You probably wanted to avoid awkward conversations like this.

**Max: **Uh...pretty much, yeah.

**Chloe: **Look, the worst thing you can do is treat me like a baby. I still want to laugh and talk shit with my best friend. Can we stop? This is seriously the best view of the sunset. What do photographers call that?

**Max: **"The golden hour."

**Chloe: **See? Without you here, I'd have no clue. Bet you could take some amazing shots... Those beached whales are so sad. I kind of know how they feel... At least I'm alive here with you.

**Max: **You're a real survivor, Chloe. I know you have to deal with so much.

**Chloe: **I don't want anybody else feeling sorry for me. I can do that...along with my parents. My dad still feels guilty about buying me that car.

**Chloe:** We never actually have, huh? There's not much to say. Some prick in an SUV cut me off and I flew into a ditch.

**Chloe: **I saw everything in bullet time. I felt my back snap and... And that was the last thing I ever felt in my body. When I woke up in the hospital, I literally couldn't move a muscle.

**Max: **Jesus! I...I don't know what to say.

**Chloe: **Don't say anything. I'm just happy I did get to see you again. I could have ended up vanishing out of the blue like that girl from Blackwell.

You mean Rachel?# You mean Rachel?**Max:** You mean Rachel Amber? When was the last time you talked to her?

**Chloe:** Uh, never. I just read about her in the news. I didn't even know her name. You did?

|-|What missing girl?What missing girl?**Max:** What missing girl?

**Chloe:** I don't know her name, just read about it in the news. I feel bad for her family.

**Max: **This is such a different world than when we were kids, isn't it...

**Chloe: **After that snow and eclipse, it's more like the end of the world.

You think?# You think?**Max:** Do you think so? I haven't kept up with the details.

**Chloe:** I have more time on my hands than you... Plus I'm a science nerd. But none of this makes sense.

|-|It might be.It might be.**Max:** It might be, but...I'd like to think we can still change things for the better.

**Chloe:** I'd like to think that too...but I don't have much hope these days.

|-|Don't say that.# Don't say that.**Max:** Don't say that.

**Chloe:** Not trying to bum you out. It just seems like Arcadia Bay is having a meltdown.

**Max: **I know things seem out of control, but...as long as we're together, I don't feel afraid.

**Chloe: **Hanging out with you makes me feel like a total kid again. You don't even know...

**Max: **Listen, Chloe...I'm sorry I haven't been out to see you more. That was wrong. You're my best friend.

**Chloe: **Max, thanks for coming out to see me. You're...you're doing awesome.

**Max: **I don't think so.

**Chloe: **Um. My...my nose is getting cold. Maybe we should get back to my place.

**Max: **It is hella cold out here.

**Chloe: **"Hella"? I hate that word, no offense.

**Chloe: '''Feels like a high-tech cell. But I am lucky my parents bust their ass to take care of me. I know it's hard for them...

**Max: **They're grateful you are here with them.

**Chloe: **Right. Especially when they can't even take a walk alone. Sometimes I act like a total teenage brat just to give them an excuse to yell at me. Pathetic, I know.

**Max: **Chloe, you're a great daughter. You're kind and sensitive, when you don't even have to be.

**Chloe: **Trust me, I still get my rage on. Especially when a nurse has to watch while I take a dump, so she can wipe my bum. Or when doctors flip me around like I was a science doll...

**Max: **I can't even imagine... But you're still amazing. You always have been since we were kids.

**Chloe: **Thanks again for coming, Max. I, uh...need to get my drink on. Can you bring me some water?

*Max gets up from her chair.*

*Max gives Chloe a cup of water on the nightstand.*

**Max: **Drink up, buttercup.

**Chloe: **Oh man, no wonder my throat is dry. I don't think I've talked this much the whole year.

**Max: **Have you ever thought about doing a podcast or something?

**Chloe: **I wish I could punch your face right now. A podcast? Dude, I am a pod in a cast. Boring.

**Max: **Ouch. It was just a thought...

**Chloe: **I know you're just trying to help.

**Max: **Yeah, that's become a bad habit of mine...

**Chloe: **You sound like an adult now. It seems like we were kids in another life.

You're right.You're right.**Max:** You're right... I wish I could take us all the way back there again.

**Chloe:** Wish I could build us a...DeLorean.

**Max:** Well, um, with your scientific mind, you might do that. But time travel can screw things up, too...

**Chloe:** Plus, you'd have to be my live-in assistant to help me build a machine.

|-|What do you remember?# What do you remember?**Max:** What do you remember about us as kids? We all have different memories...

**Chloe:** I think about us as little pirates, running and jumping through Arcadia Bay.

**Max:** Me too. But, we're still pirates in our own way.

**Chloe:** Uh, yeah, right. Check me out, "Chloe of the Caribbean." No way will I get on a fucking boat now. Unless you're with me.

|-|Seems like yesterday.Seems like yesterday.**Max:** To me, it seems like yesterday we were little brats here, watching "Power Rangers" and destroying the kitchen.

**Chloe:** Oh my God, we covered everything in flour, even my parents.

**Max:** That was so hilarious!

**Chloe:** But a long time ago. You're the only person I grew up with who visits me...

**Chloe: **As you can see, I can't keep all my other friends away.

Which friends?# Which friends?**Max:** Which friends did you hang out with the most?

**Chloe:** Megan Weaver, but you don't know her. She was cool. But after my accident she was too cool for school.

|-|You have me.You have me.**Max:** You have me. I'm not leaving you, Chloe.

**Chloe:** Well, you didn't visit me a lot either. I mean, I loved your cards and photos, but...

**Max: **I know I wasn't around much. No excuses, I'm a loser. But, I am trying to make things right.

**Chloe: **How? Dude, you're not Super Max. And I'm not trying to guilt-trip you. That's what my parents are for...

Are they okay?# Are they okay?**Max:** Are they okay? I mean, are they still happy together and everything?

**Chloe:** So now you're Dr. Bill? I guess they're good, considering they have to deal with me. They laugh and hold hands...and I hope they still get busy too... 

|-|Are you lonely?Are you lonely?**Max:** I know this is a dumb question, but...are you lonely here?

**Chloe:** Yes, dumb question. I don't mind being alone. I can't exactly go party like a rock star, though...or get in any teen trouble with the folks.

|-|They love you.# They love you.**Max:** They love you so much.

**Chloe:** I know. My mom and dad are so cute. They always pop in here and make sure everything's okay with me.

**Max: **I think Joyce and William are incredible.

**Chloe: **Max, the accident has been so hard on them. Our insurance sucks and the medical bills are fucking insane.

I bet.I bet.**Max:** I bet. This tech must be crazy expensive.

**Chloe:** Along with the drugs, the nurses, the supplies... Mom and Dad are always broke and they get so frustrated... Is it worth it?

|-|Can they pay?# Can they pay?**Max:** Can they pay all the bills?

**Chloe:** No way. They keep the numbers away from me, but it doesn't take much research to find out I'm costing my parents almost a million dollars a year.

**Max: **Chloe, you're priceless. Uh, no pun intended.

**Chloe: **You are such a geek. That's why I love you. Of course, I know a geek when I be one. See, I'm practically a human entertainment system. It would be sweet to chill out together and watch a movie, like when you'd spend the night at my house...

**Max: **What do you want to watch?

**Chloe: **Uh, I think I'm in, like, a mellow "Blade Runner" mood. I always cry at the end. Plus you know I always wanted to have cool colored bangs like Pris.

**Max: **I know. You would look incredible with blue hair. Now let's get this show on the road. And you better not fall asleep on me, like you always do when we watch movies.

**Chloe: **I remember, Max. Swear I won't fall asleep. Not when you're here. Not yet.

**Optional Conversation with Chloe**

''Max uses the tissue box to clean Chloe's face.''

**Chloe: **Thanks. I think you missed a grain stuck in my eyeball.

**Max: **Hard to believe how just a little sand can cause such a big mess.

**Chloe: **It's like that Chinese proverb, "A spark can start a fire that burns the entire prairie." You know, like that butterfly thing...

**Max: **So I've heard...

*Max searches the left drawer beneath the TV to get the DVD.*

**Max (thinking):** Aha, here's the DVD.

*Max places the DVD in the player and sits next to Chloe. They start watching Blade Runner; Max is next shown waking up in the morning.*

**Max: **I cannot believe you fell asleep so fast. How dare you.

**Chloe: **I know you were beat down after the day with me. And Blade Runner is a pretty dreamy movie to watch at night. Uh, do you think Deckard is a replicant? Sorry, I can see you're not wide awake like me.

**Max: **No, I'm sorry I crashed so hard. Were you...okay?

**Chloe: **I do have a mother and father when you're not falling asleep on me.

**Max: **You are a bitch in the morning.

**Chloe: **It's the company I keep... Yesterday was such a blast.

**Max: **It was great, seeing you.

**Chloe: **I know things were different when we were just dorky kids, but being with you made me feel like we were little pirates, jumping and running through the forests again. It meant a lot to me just to chill out with you and bullshit. Ahh... Fuck. Um, I'm getting my regular head pains... Uh, can you pretty please go upstairs and get my--my morphine injector in the bathroom?

**Max: **Morphine injector?

**Chloe: **It's--ahh. It's total Star Trek shit. You can't even see the needle. Seriously, I need it. Um, my parents keep the swag upstairs because they think I can't get to it...but you can, Max. Like a pirate, right?

**Max: **I'm on it, Chloe.

**Second Optional Conversation with Chloe**

**Chloe: ** So, are you sure it isn't too weird for you to be hanging out with me like this?

Kind of.Kind of.**Max:** Kind of, but only because I haven't seen you in so long... I was selfish.

**Chloe:** No, you were busy kicking ass. I don't blame anyone for bailing on me. People suck. Just joking.

|-|No way.# No way.**Max:** No way. I don't want you to feel weird.

**Chloe:** My life is just so different than yours. I mean, we can't just bounce out of here and... I'll be doped up half the day in pain. So that's cool.

**Chloe: **But I do feel grateful I can see the ocean, that I have parents who love me, and that my best friend is here with me today.

**Max: ** Exactly. So, what else do you need?

**Chloe: ** Well, hot monkey sex would be nice. Oh, look, I made Maxine blush! So, are you dating anyone at Blackwell?

Too busy.Too busy.**Max:** I'm too busy with school and photography.

**Chloe:** Oh, please. You can't be an artist unless you experience life... That includes boys, girls, whatever.

|-|Not really.# Not really.**Max:** Not really, no. There are some cute boys there, but you know me... I'm too damn shy.

**Chloe:** Which is stupid because you are so damn cool. Some bro has to be crushing on you.

**Chloe:** More like they're here for me. But then, so are you... so it's all good.

**Max: **Hey, William. Am I bothering you?

**William: **Why, yes, Max, I love going through bills. Kidding. How can you bother me? I haven't seen you in forever.

**Max: **I know. You look exactly the same. It's so cool.

**William: **Good, or I'd be ascared if I didn't look like me... Of course, you seem more adult now. So what's on your mind?

Chloe.Chloe.**Max:** I don't know how to say this, but I am truly sorry about what happened to Chloe.

**William:** Me too. All it takes is a few minutes to change a girl's whole life. But she's alive. And she's been a trooper.

{{#tag:tabber|Is she mad at me?# Is she mad at me?**Max:** Is she mad at me for not staying in touch? She should be, I have no excuse.

**William:** I know you will, Max.

**William:** You should be. We could buy a few mansions for what it all costs. The insurance helps, but...I don't know, Max.

**Max:** I know it must be hard on you guys, financially.

**William:** These bills are more like crushing. We have to mortgage our home and that's pretty scary...but we'll get through it. The Price is always right. Get it? No?

|-|Joyce.Joyce.**Max:** Being around you and Joyce again is so nostalgic.

**William:** Very old school, as they say. I think it's great for Chloe to see you. It makes Joyce happy, too. So it's not all bad news in Arcadia Bay. Or is it?

{{#tag:tabber|Rachel Amber.# Rachel Amber.**Max:** I was reading about that missing girl...Rachel Amber?

**William:** "Oui," as they say. Not me, because I can't speak French. But it was a great experience, especially for Chloe.

**Max:** I can see her loving it there. You guys rock for going on a family adventure like that.

**William:** She talked about going to school there...but that's not practical anymore. It's not fair, Max...

**Max:** You rule, Joyce.

**Joyce:** Shit, things would be different if I did... I like how you think, kid.

|-|Joyce.# Joyce.**Max:** How are you doing, Joyce?

**Joyce:** I'm doing the best I can, Max. I won't lie, it's difficult...but nobody said life was easy here in Arcadia Bay.

{{#tag:tabber|David Madsen.David Madsen.**Max:** Do you know somebody named David Madsen? He, um...might hang out at the Two Whales.

**Joyce:** Well, that was random. Yeah, he's a bus driver. He comes in sometimes. Cute, quiet. Why?

{{!}}-{{!}}Lot of work.# Lot of work.**Max:** Plus you guys have to work, too.

**Joyce:** I know that Sean Prescott won't be happy until he owns everything in Arcadia Bay. Stay away from his son, Nathan.

{{!}}-{{!}}Eco-havoc.Eco-havoc.**Max:** So, what do you think is going on here with all this eco-havoc?

**Max:** I don't blame you, Joyce.

**Joyce:** Except now we have dead birds and beached whales outside our front door... So maybe I should care, for Chloe's sake.

|-|Chloe.# Chloe.**Max:** I wish I was a better friend. I know Chloe doesn't get many visitors.

{{#tag:tabber|I hope so.I hope so.**Max:** I hope so. You guys do such an amazing job taking care of her.

**Joyce:** Max, Chloe's condition is not improving. Her respiratory system is very weak and she...she...do you know what I'm saying?

**Max:** Oh, Joyce, I'm so sorry you have to go through all this.

**Joyce:** Bad or good, I embrace every moment with my daughter and husband. This is what it means to be a family...and we'll always be one, no matter what.

|-|Leave.Leave.**Max:** I better get back to Chloe now. It's good talking with you, Joyce.

**Joyce:** You too, honey.

*Max enters the bathroom and takes the morphine injector from the left side of the cupboard above the toilet.*

**Max (thinking): **Here it is. Never thought I'd be delivering morphine to my best friend.

# ###  **Downstairs** 
*Max returns to Chloe and gives her the morphine.*

**Chloe: **Finally. Give me the blue pill...

**Max: **I'm sorry. I'm nosy, but not precise.

**Chloe: **Go ahead and plug it right in. It's so easy. And painless.

**Max: **Um, okay, but get ready to yell for your folks if I screw up. ''(Max injects the morphine into Chloe's IV)''

**Chloe: **Oh, trust me, I will. Of course, my pain just keeps getting worse...but you caught me on a good day. Max, I'm so grateful that I'm even able to hang out with you. See, I'm getting mushy. I'm already high.

**Max: **You are so adorable. Do you want anything else?

**Chloe: **Um, stop me if I'm being too emo, but can you grab one of the photo albums over there? I'd like to check out some old pictures of us when we were kids.

**Max: **Please. My diary is like emo ground zero. Plus Max Caulfield does not pass up a photo op with Chloe Price. Ever.

''Max takes the photo album on the chest of drawers near the window, then returns to Chloe and places the album on Chloe's lap.*

**Max: **Is that okay?

**Chloe: **Perfect. Oh my god, look how little we are there! We look like toys!

**Max: **I remember that day by the lighthouse.

**Chloe: **My dad was pissed at us. He actually tried to give us a time-out!

**Max: **And you laughed at him. My dad would have banished me.

*Max turns the page.''

**Chloe: **Whoa, awesome picture. We look so badass in our pirate gear.

**Max: **We should have taken over Arcadia Bay when we had the chance.

**Chloe: **There's still time for you...

*Max turns the page.*

**Chloe: **Oh man, there we are making pancakes. I love that shot of us. It's hard to believe my dad took that picture only five years ago.

**Max: **Literally seems like yesterday...

**Chloe: **I wish it was.

**Max: **Me too...

**Max (thinking): **This photo... Maybe I could...

**Chloe: **Listen, Max, my respiratory system is failing and...and it's only getting worse. I've heard the doctors talking about it when they thought I was zonked out. So I know I'm just putting off the inevitable, while my parents suffer along...and I will, too. This isn't how I want things to end.

**Max: **What? What are you saying?

**Chloe: **I'm saying that being with you again has been so special. I just wanted to feel like when we were kids running around Arcadia Bay...and everything was possible. And you made me feel that way today. I want this time with you to be my last memory... Do you understand?

**Max: **Yes, I do.

**Chloe: **All you have to do is crank up the IV to eleven...

ACCEPT# ACCEPT**Max:** Chloe...

**Chloe:** I'll just drift asleep...dreaming of us here together...forever.

**Chloe:** Thank you so much. I'm so proud of you for following your dreams. Don't forget about me.

**Max:** Never.

**Chloe:** I love you, Max. See you around.

**Max:** Sooner than you think.

''Chloe's eyes close and her muscles relax.''

|-|REFUSEREFUSE**Max:** Chloe...I can't. It wrecks me to see you in any pain, but I don't have any right to do this.

**Chloe:** I'm an adult. I'm giving you the right.

**Max:** But Joyce...and William...

**Chloe:** I already said my goodbyes to them, but they won't honor my wishes. You will...right?

**Max:** I can't...kill you with an overdose.

**Chloe:** Max, I'm dying from my illness, not my dosage. This accelerates the process. I'd rather go out on a wave than a rock. And I want my best friend to help me out...

**Max:** I'm going to help you, but not like that. You have to believe me, Chloe.

**Chloe:** Why, Max? You're just bailing on me like everybody else! Why don't you go now? You've been wanting to since you got here, right? So go and don't come back. *(Chloe turns her face away from Max)*

**Max:** Chloe, I am never leaving you again.

|-|I DON'T KNOW# I DON'T KNOW**Max:** Chloe...I really don't know if I can do this. I had another friend who wanted to...end it all and I did everything I could to try and save her life. How can I be responsible for ending yours? I mean, there's got to be another way.

**Chloe:** Max, you were there for your friend no matter what. Now I'm asking you to help me the same way.

**Max:** I want to help you, Chloe, but I think my help is hurting.

**Chloe:** At least you have a choice. When you want to make a decision, you can just do it. Look at me, I'm at the mercy of...everybody. For once, I want to make my own choice...the most important one of my life. Please...help me, Max.

*Max is forced to choose to ACCEPT or REFUSE*

*Max focuses on the photo.*

**Max: **I'm sorry, William...

*After a successful focus, Max returns to her 13-year-old body.*

*If Max remembers the code from Episode 3 (7171), she can input it into the lockers.*

**Max (thinking): **Oh yes, I knew that number would be important.

*After one or more failed attempts at unlocking the padlock or after pressing "back," Max can find another way to open the lockers.*

(Sided with David)(Sided with David)

**Max (thinking): **''For once, I don't have time to search for the code... I need to find a key.*

*Max tries to take the keys from the desk in front of David.*

**David: **Excuse me, Max! Do not touch one goddamn thing!

**Max (thinking): ***Come on, Max, find a way to get David out of his cave...*

*Max tampers with the fuse box in the back of the garage, next to the door leading to the foyer.*

**Max (thinking): ***I can't let David see me while I snag his keys. Enter the ninja...*

**David: **Son of a bitch, I just fixed that fuse box!

**Chloe (from upstairs): **Shit. Somebody fix the fuse!

*Max enters the door next to the fuse box. She returns to the other entrance to the garage and takes David's keys from the table.*

**Max (thinking): ***Gotcha!*

*Max rewinds to before she tampered with the fuse box. She uses the keys on the padlock.*

**Max (thinking): ***I am the Keymaster!*

|-|(Sided with Chloe)# (Sided with Chloe)**Max (thinking):** *For once, I don't have time to search for the code... I need to find a way to break this padlock.*

*Max takes the crowbar from the table.*

**Max (thinking):** *Okay, I can use that crowbar to pry open the locker.*

*Max uses the crowbar to break the padlock off the locker.*

**Max (thinking):** *Sorry, David, but I bet you would do the same thing as me.*

*Max searches through the contents of the locker.*

**Max (thinking): **Whoa... Maps, notes, coordinates, photos of Kate, Nathan... Oh, yes!

*Max closes the locker after rifling through the files.*

**Max (thinking): **Score! Back to Chloe now.

**Max (thinking): **I give up William, but defend David... Would Chloe hate me if she knew?

*Max goes to the bottom of the stairs and calls out to Chloe.''

**Max: **Yo, Chloe, are you ready yet? I have to get back to my dorm!

**Chloe: **Are we happy?

**Max: **Very happy. I hit the secret file jackpot. Kate, Nathan, and Rachel. Plus, there's some location coordinates. David is, like, a one-man surveillance army. Now let's get the hell out of here, before we get busted.

*The two girls get in the truck and drive away.*

###  **Hospital** 
*If Max saved Kate, she and Chloe are shown entering a hallway in a hospital.*

**Max: **This is definitely Kate's floor.

**Chloe: **Hospitals always freak me out.

**Max: **I hear you. But imagine how Kate feels... I'm so glad I get to see her again. I hope it's not too weird for her.

**Chloe: **No, she'll be stoked to see you. Who wouldn't be?

''Max and Chloe reach the door to Kate's hospital room.''

**Max: **This be it. I'm a little nervous...

**Chloe: **Just go in there and be her friend. I'll wait out here so you can chill by yourselves.

*Chloe sits in a chair against the wall.*

(Answered Kate's call)(Answered Kate's call)**Chloe:** I was a total dick for blowing a fuse when you answered Kate's call the other day. Good thing you ignored me. I had no idea what shit she was going through. And you saved her... like me.

**Chloe: ** I'm sorry.

**Max: **Thanks, Chloe, but don't be sorry. We're all on the same team.

**Chloe: **Team Max. Let Kate know we're gonna string Nathan up by his balls then.

**Max: **Oh, yes. I'm on it.

*Max enters the room. Kate is sitting on a chair, drawing. She sees Max and the two smile at each other. Kate jumps up and gives Max a hug.*

**Kate: **Max!

**Max: **Oh, Kate!

**Kate: **I thought I'd never see you again. I feel so ridiculous... I'm so sorry.

**Max: **Kate, listen to me... you have nothing to be sorry about. Other people do. You do not know how happy I am to see you. You look awesome. Is it a stupid question if I ask how you're doing?

**Kate: **Now that you're here, I'm doing even better. I'm so grateful to you for coming up to the roof to talk me down... Max, I felt so lost and alone... but when I saw how much you cared, how hard you were trying... you made me realize I wasn't alone. Thank you.

**Max: **Kate, there are so many people who love you and want to help you.

**Kate: **I know, you should see all the letters and postcards. I gave most of the flowers to other patients here because they need them more than me. I'm keeping the balloons, though. One of the nurses gave me some pen and paper so I could do some drawings.

*Kate sits down again and resumes drawing.*

**Max: **I love your illustrations.

**Kate: **They got kind of dark there for a while, but I have an idea for a new children's book about bullying... I was thinking about having some photographs in there too.

**Max: **I hope that's a subtle hint that you'll let me take the photographs for the book...

**Kate: **Was that subtle? You better take the pictures, Max. I'm going to be here for another day until my family comes out to visit.

**Max: **How are they treating you?

**Kate: **Like they need to protect me forever. They're so upset and I know they feel guilty, even though they didn't do anything. I was surprised how many students from Blackwell wrote me. Daniel, Mr. Jefferson... Even Victoria wrote me a very sweet note... and I believe she was being real.

**Max: **Me too. I'm glad you believe again, Kate.

**Kate: **I'm working on it, Max. I just pray I can get this drawing right...

**Conversation with Kate**

**Max: **Kate, it is so good to hang out with you again.

**Kate: **Max, I owe you so much. And I can tell you want to talk to me about something.

**Jefferson:** I can imagine. Max, are you sure that you're alright?

(Max isn't suspended)(Max isn't suspended)

**Max:** It's weird being suspended and just walking around campus.

**Max:** Not until we get orange jumpsuits.

**Jefferson:** On that note, Blackwell duty calls. Remember, I'm going to announce the winner of the "Everyday Heroes" contest tonight at the party, so I hope you'll be there to celebrate. Even though I'm sorry you didn't enter a photo, I understand your reasons. You can't force an artist to work.

**Max:** Thanks, Mr. Jefferson. I'll definitely be there tonight.

**Chloe:** Me too. I'll be Max's date. You better dance with us at least once.

**Chloe:** Not yet. Just wait until the rager tonight...

**Max:** Ugh, shut up.

**Chloe:** Don't be jealous because Mark Jefferson thinks I'm cool...

**Max:** I am so ignoring you.

**Chloe:** Fine. Since I'm here, I'll see if I can get some dirt from Justin. I haven't talked to him in a while...

**Max:** Now, that is a great plan.

*Chloe leaves to talk with Justin.*

**Max (thinking):** Let's see if I can find out where Nathan is...

*Frank pulls out the client list and hands it to Chloe.*

**Frank:** There. Now leave me alone, all right? Just get out of my life.

**Max:** Do you want us to call an ambulance? Or...

**Frank:** No, thanks... You know what, I'll manage somehow without the police.

**Max:** Oh, right.

**Chloe:** Let’s bounce.

(Frank is alive)(Frank is alive)
**Chloe:** Max, I know we can snap all these pieces together…

**Max:** Roger that, I’m going to study the board and try to connect all these dots…

'''Max's thoughts on the investigation'''

(Frank's clues)(Frank's clues)
'*Max *(thinking)*:*' Let’s look at Frank’s drug deals during the week of the party.

*Max takes the Account Book and the list of names.*

'*Max *(thinking)*:*' Yes! The game is on! Now talk to us, account book... tell us everything.

*Max investigates the new clues on the board.*

'*Max *(thinking)*:*' Hmmm, let's see if I can find any deal Frank made with Nathan or the Vortex Club.

*Max takes the papers that mention Nathan.*

'*Max *(thinking)*:*' Oh yes, these are all the times and places for Frank and Nathan's deals. That's it, Max.

|-|(David's clues)# (David's clues)
'*Max *(thinking)*:*' Thanks to David’s own investigation, I should be able to find out what Nathan did during the party’s week.

*Max takes the coordinates, the pictures of the red truck, and the photos of Nathan.*

'*Max *(thinking)*:*' And that’s all she wrote. Please let me find some clues about Nathan in here…

*Max investigates the new clues on the board.*

'*Max *(thinking)*:*' Great, now how do I find out which car is Nathan’s to match the coordinates?

''Max takes the photos of Nathan's truck and the corresponding coordinates.*

*'Max *(thinking)*:''' Elementary, my dear Max! This is so Nathan's car! Now let's find out where this fucker was the day of the Vortex Club party.

(Frank is alive)(Frank is alive)
**Max:** Yes, now we’re finally getting somewhere… Chloe, let’s plug in these numbers and see if they lead to an actual address.

**Chloe:** Aye aye, captain.

|-|(Frank is dead)# (Frank is dead)

**Max:** Now we're finally getting somewhere. Chloe, I need you to go online and help me decipher this. Chloe?

**Max:** Chloe... Chloe, please listen... I know this is awful, but we're in it together, okay? I didn't have your back and I let you down. Please don't cry...

**Chloe:** Max... I'm going to go to the police after we find Rachel. I can't live keeping this a secret... and I don't want to be a teenage fugitive on the run. And dude, I swear I won't even mention you, okay? This is all me.

**Max:** Chloe, it was self-defense. I know you're hurting, but you have to just block out everything and keep moving forward. Rachel is waiting.

**Chloe:** Okay... you're right. Focus on Rachel. It's all about Rachel now. Okay.

**Max:** We will. I know this week has been so weird and fucked up, but Chloe... this has to be our destiny. Or at least one of them. Let's just find out where this is all going to end, okay? For Rachel... for Kate.

**Chloe:** And for Frank. He was dragged into this bullshit, too.

**Max:** That's my Chloe. Now let's be a lean, mean, research team. You have to go online and help decipher these coordinates... because they might finally lead us to Rachel.

*Chloe gets up from her bed and sits down at her desk.*

**Chloe:** Here we come, Rachel.

''Max takes the screenshot of Nathan's text messages to Frank, the record of their transaction on October 4th, and the photo of the barn.*

*Max deduces the remaining clues and brings a photo of a barn to Chloe.*

**Max:** Chloe, this is definitely the place.

**Chloe:** Let me dig up some more clues here.

*Chloe tries looking up info about the barn. ''

**Chloe:** Nope... Nothing, Max. There's nothing here. Just some shitty old barn...

**Max:** Let's keep searching and find out who owns this haunted barn.

**Chloe:** I'm on this, hold on.

*Chloe searches the barn.*

**Chloe:** Somebody named—"Harry Aaron Prescott."

**Max:** I'm shocked. Should we call the police?

**Chloe:** Fuck that. You know the police here are like Nathan's private security, right?

**Max:** That's so messed up...

**Chloe:** As you've noticed, this whole town is messed up. We can't trust anybody... Except each other. So we have to go out to that farmhouse by ourselves.

**Max:** I was afraid you'd say that. We could call Warren, since he kicked Nathan's ass...

**Chloe:** It's just the two of us. Nobody else. And I'm not scared at all. You have the power. I feel like we're this close to finding Rachel... We have to find her, Max.

**Max:** We will. But remember, my power isn't infinite. We still have to be careful. Do you hear, Chloe?

**Chloe:** Yes, sir.

''Max and Chloe leave Chloe's room to find the barn. Chloe's computer remains on, showing a map and the coordinates of the barn.*

*Chloe drives her truck up a dirt path, passing a sign that reads "NO TRESPASSING." She pulls up to the barn and parks. The girls get out of the truck and approach the barn.''

**Max:** Holy shit, this is scary.

**Chloe:** I know, but we're here. Let's go find the best way in.

*Max bends down to examine tire tracks.*

**Max:** Whoa, check this out. Fresh tire tracks.

**Chloe:** Dude, somebody was just here.

**Max:** Then we need to get in that barn...

'''Chloe's comments**

**Chloe:'* Max, get over here before I torch this place!

*Max goes around to the side of the barn and moves a metal sheet, revealing another entrance.''

**Max:** Chloe! I found the front door! Come on!

**Chloe:** Oh yes! Maximus rules!

**Max:** God, this is way too Blair Witch... I have goose bumps all over.

**Chloe:** Come on, Super Max. Hey, check out this old chest!

**Max:** A little louder, Chloe! Jeez, that is ancient.

**Chloe:** Jackpot. Old shit.

**Max:** No, look closer.

**Chloe:** "Harry Aaron Prescott and family donate new library to Arcadia Bay"... "Prescott Industries celebrate grand opening"... "The Prescotts bring bomb shelter boom to town."

**Max:** Nice scrapbook. You search for more clues and I'll scope out the area.

'*Max *(thinking)*:*' ''Yes, old Prescott clippings, but that can't be the only thing here.*

*'Chloe's comments**

**Chloe: '*Boring... boring...

*Max walks to the other side of the barn and searches the ground, revealing a hatch.*

*'Max *(thinking)*:'* *Whoa, what is this? It's totally brand new. Why?*

*Max attaches a nearby hook to the padlock. She walks over to a platform and attempts to climb onto it.*

**Max:** Chloe, can you give me a hand?

**Chloe:** Sidekick at your service! Up, up and away, Super Max.

**Max:** I dig having minions.

*Max pulls the old motor down from the platform above her, steps onto it, and climbs to the next platform. She then rewinds until the motor is back in place, then attaches a nearby rope to it. She pulls the motor, which comes crashing down, pulling up the padlock.*

*'Max *(thinking)*:'* *MaxGyver strikes again!*

*Max jumps back down to the ground floor and walks back over to the hatch.*

**Max:** Damn, this is heavy...

*Max and Chloe open the hatch to reveal a staircase.*

**Chloe:** What... is this?

**Max:** Jackpot. Do I even need to say how weird this is?

**Chloe:** You just did. Who builds this kind of place?

**Max:** A Prescott, of course.

*'Max *(thinking)*:'* *This bunker is so surreal.*

*Max enters the grayed-out numbers, 542, into the keypad.*

**Max:** Oh yes! I thought that only worked in the movies! Open sesame.

**Chloe:** Stocked and ready for the apocalypse. This must have cost a fortune. Come on.

*'Max *(thinking)*:'* *Now what the hell is this...*

*'Chloe's comments**

**Chloe: **Everything is sketchy as fuck, but nothing about Rachel here.

**Chloe: '*Can you imagine chilling in this room?

*Max opens the cupboard to reveal rows of red binders. She takes out the binders labeled "Rachel," "Kate," and "Victoria" and puts them on the desk.''

**Chloe:** Come on, let's see what this shit is all about.

**Max:** We are. Okay, a binder marked "Victoria," but it's empty...

**Chloe:** Look, the next one says "Kate."

**Max:** Oh no, Kate... No...

**Chloe:** God, I should have killed that bastard back there.

**Max:** Kate wasn't the first... All those binders are filled with other victims. Victoria has to be next. Nathan must be planning to dose her tonight at the Vortex Club party.

**Chloe:** Rachel... This can't be real... These are all--these are all posed shots, right? Right?

**Max:** Chloe. Look at her face. She's... out of it.

**Chloe:** Maybe--maybe Nathan paid her a shitload of cash to do this. She probably would have.

**Max:** I don't think so. Why is he putting her in the ground like that? Where--

**Chloe:** The junkyard! Max, we have to find that spot, now! Then we can see what he did... There's no way she's dead. No way! She posed for those pictures, Max. I know it, please... let's go.

'*Max *(thinking)*:*' *Oh my God... Rachel... Kate... all these files...*

### **Junkyard**

''Max runs back to Chloe's truck and they drive to the junkyard. Chloe brings her truck to a stop, opens her door, and runs. Max follows.''

**Max:** Chloe, slow down! Wait for me!

**Chloe:** I know exactly where I'm going!

''Chloe runs to the corner of the junkyard near the Steve's Famous Crab sign.*

**Chloe: **Look, this is it! This is it!

*Chloe begins to dig with her hands.*

**Chloe: **Are you going to help me, Max?

**Max: **Chloe, stop! Look!

**Chloe: **Please, no...

**Max: **That smell...

**Chloe: **Rachel... Oh, Rachel, no, no! Please, not her!

*Max covers her mouth with her hands as she watches Chloe's reaction. Chloe moves a few feet away and begins to gag. Max runs over to Chloe and puts one hand on her shoulder and another hand on her back, trying to comfort her.''

**Max: **Chloe...

**Chloe: **Rachel... why?

**Max: **I'm sorry, Chloe. I'm so sorry...

''Chloe hugs her knees to her chest, sobbing, and covers her face with her hand. Max puts her hands on Chloe's shoulders and hugs her.*

**Chloe: **I loved her so much... How can she be dead? What kind of world does this? Who does this?

*A spiritual deer watches them from across the junkyard. Gradually, it fades away.*

### **Parking Lot**

*Max and Chloe sit in the truck.''

**Chloe: **I hope Nathan enjoys his last party.

**Max: **Chloe, we can go right to the cops. We have proof.

**Chloe: **Fuck the police. Rachel wanted us to find her. So we could get real justice... and revenge. The Prescotts have had this coming for a hundred years, and nobody is going to get in my way. Especially with your help... right?

**Max: **I'm with you to the end, Chloe. You know that.

*Chloe looks down at her gun and puts it in her back pocket. They get out of the car.*

**Boy: **Oh, shit, this is like that eclipse.

**Girl: **You're right. Look at the outline.

**Boy: **I can't tell if they're different.

**Girl: **There can't be two moons... that's not possible...

*Max looks up at the sky to see two moons.*

**Max: **What is that? Jesus, Chloe, look up at the sky!

**Chloe: **Beautiful, I don't give a shit. The world is ending, cool.

**Max: **You're not listening! Something major is going down!

**Chloe: **That's right. Nathan Prescott is going down.

*Chloe and Max start to walk towards the building. Warren stops them.*

**Warren: **Welcome to the end of the world, ladies. I'm glad you decided to escort me...

**Max: **You look really good, Warren. Are you all right after today?

(Max stopped Warren from beating Nathan)# (Max stopped Warren from beating Nathan)

**Warren: **I'm glad you stopped me... Nathan is dangerous.

|-|(Warren beat up Nathan)(Warren beat up Nathan)

**Warren: **I really flipped out on Nathan. I just hate bullies... and Max, he's dangerous.

**Chloe: **Where is he?

**Warren: **I didn't see him at the dorm again. I was holed up in my room.

**Max: **Dude, have you been drinking?

**Warren: **Well, if you consider half a beer "drinking"...

**Chloe: **Let's go, Max.

**Warren: **Hey, hey... I know this is a bad time, but can I get one picture? I've been feeling like this might be actually the end of the world, so... I want to have something for prosperity.

**Max: **Well... I don't blame you, Warren.

**Warren: **I know, I know, I'm a pain in the booty. Just one picture. Uh...

**Max: **Action.

''Warren uses Max's camera to take a polaroid of the two of them together.''

**Chloe: **We got no time for this shit. Come on, Max.

**Warren: **Sorry... I just wanted to feel like a normal student after this week's ultraviolence. I never hit anybody like that before... I was always the one getting my ass kicked.

**Max: **Hey, we still need your expert help. If you see Nathan, text me immediately, okay? And do not let him see you.

**Warren: **He won't. I know how to be invisible here...

**Max: **Not to me, Warren. Text soon.

**Max: **No, thanks, Stella. Have you seen Nathan yet?

**Stella: **No, thank God. That boy creeps me out... Wait, some girl just asked about Nathan before you came in.

Nathan's creepy?Nathan's creepy?**Max:** Why does Nathan creep you out? He should. I just want your reasons.

**Stella:** He's a bully for one thing and he hit Warren for another... But have you ever looked at his eyes? Glazed and raging. Me no like.

|-|What girl?# What girl?**Max:** What girl?

**Stella:** She had blue hair, dressed like a punk... I've seen her putting up those Rachel Amber posters. I'm stuck here, so I'm sorry I can't help you.

**Max: **So why are you working at a Vortex Club party? I didn't think you wanted to be a member.

**Stella: **Screw that. I'm here for the job.

Who hired you?Who hired you?**Max:** Who hired you?

**Stella:** Mr. Jefferson asked me because he knows I don't have a lot of money, even with my job and scholarship. I'm not cool enough for this school.

|-|Anything unusual?# Anything unusual?**Max:** Do you notice anything unusual about the Vortex Club tonight?

**Stella:** Yeah, I notice they don't give a shit about Kate Marsh. I'm glad for the job, but I think Principal Wells should have canceled the party. Guess I'm not cool enough.

**Max: **Yes, you are, Stella. You're smart, honest, and you bust your ass for Blackwell. I hope everything turns out your way in the end.

**Stella: **Awww, thank you, Max. I really appreciate that. Hey, your face looks so intense... are you okay?

**Max: **Um, no, I'm actually not okay. I... I just need to find Nathan. And don't get too close if you see him.

**Stella: **Hell no. This is homework, not a party. I'll text you if I spy him. Good luck.

*Max walks through the curtains and enters the party.*

'*Max* (thinking)*:*' *We need to find Nathan and take him down.*

### **Optional Conversation with Daniel**# 

*Only available if Max convinced Daniel to attend the party.*

**Max:** Hi, Daniel.

**Daniel:** Yes! Max makes an entrance! I only came to the party because of you!

**Max:** I'm glad to see you out and about. By the way, have you seen Nathan Prescott tonight?

**Daniel:** No, I've been hanging with Brooke since I got here. Max, are you okay? Your face looks so... serious.

I know.I know.

**Max:** I know. I'm not in party mode tonight.

**Daniel:** You look like you're on a secret mission...

**Max:** This is where it's going to end... for Rachel's sake.

**Daniel:** Well, I'll be celebrating someday in a museum, Max. Adios.

### **Optional Conversation with Brooke**# 

**Max:** Hello, Brooke.

**Brooke:** Max, I didn't expect to see you at a Vortex Club party.

**Max:** I didn't expect that either, but I really need to find Nathan. Have you...

**Brooke:** No, I haven't seen him. And I'm not looking for him, so I most likely won't tonight. I just hate that scrub... and his club.

Not the only one.Not the only one.

**Max:** You're not the only one. Maybe this party will be the "End Of The Vortex Club"...

**Brooke:** Then I don't have to pretend like I care anymore.

**Brooke:** Thanks, Max. Though I feel selfish talking about a boy, considering Kate and the Arcadia Bay eco-meltdown...

}}

**Max:** You're not selfish, Brooke. You're just trying to live your life without all this bullshit. Like all of us here...

**Brooke:** You seem so wise and... kind of invincible this week. I think that snow and eclipse gave you superpowers. Check to see if you can fly.

Double moon.Double moon.

**Max:** Only with your drone. By the way, did you see that crazy double moon out there earlier?

**Brooke:** Max, if I saw a double moon out there, I would assume it really was the end of the world.

**Brooke:** And so are we, Max. So let's plan a drone date next week.

### **Optional Conversation with Luke**#

**Luke:** I met him once at a Bigfoots game... mean fucking bastard. Oh man, he explains Nathan.

**Max:** That will be hard to do when the Prescotts own the town... and the Vortex Club.

**Justin:** Where else could I go in Arcadia Bay on a Thursday night? Besides, Dana is here... just not with me. So yes, this party sucks.

**Max:** Rachel Amber won't be coming either.

**Max:** You're obviously not cool with Trevor dating Dana.

**Justin:** I tried to front like I was, but when I saw them together, I came over to cry like a little bitch.

**Max:** No, it's more like somebody who's in pain. I'm sorry, Justin. But you're a cool, considerate guy and you're going to find somebody just as cool, minus the drama.

**Justin:** Max, I know I'm twisted, but your face looks so fucking intense. And your voice sounds... different. You okay? How about a quick dab?

**Max:** Uh, no. I—I'm cool, Justin. And I have to get going. Maybe you should go chill somewhere else.

**Justin:** Fucking A, Maximus! You're right. I'm only torturing myself here. Plus I'm too loaded... It's time to get my board and grind.

**Courtney:** Hey Sarah, do you know that I personally put Max’s name on the list? So you like, decide to block her from coming in while I’m taking a break? You’re not in charge here.

**Courtney:** Sarah, our friend Max here claims she’s on the list. Just for shits and giggles, let’s see.

**Courtney:** No way…

**Max:** Yes, way. That’s my name right there...

**Courtney:** Oh. My. God. Do you think I’m that dumb, Max? That’s not even my handwriting and I’m in charge of the list! Victoria is right, you are so fucking weird! Well, this is the closest you will ever get to the Vortex Club again. Promise. Yes, you can leave now, Max. The party’s over.

**Logan:** Bro, you are giving me the full body tackle... I already feel like an ass for flaking on Dana. How can I be an un-dick now?

**Dana:** I know... Juliet wrote a story describing it like a cult and I'm starting to think she was right... It's not fun anymore.

**Max:** Sounds like you're ready for a change.

**Dana:** I don't need any club to be cool or have friends. Look at you...Plus I like hanging with Trevor and his skater friends. No drama!

**Victoria:** Oh God... I swear we weren't even going to do it. Then we had some wine and got stupid.

'*Max *(thinking)*:*' Okay, I tried... She's not gonna believe me over her Vortex Club partner…

|-|(Victoria believed Max)# (Victoria believed Max)

'*Max *(thinking)*:*' Maybe there's hope yet for Victoria and me... I'm glad I warned her. I hope she's okay.

### **Conversation with Chloe**# 

*Chloe enters through a door in the back of the VIP area and waits for Max.*

**Max:** There you are. Chloe, Nathan isn't here. Nobody has seen him tonight.

**Chloe:** He’s definitely not upstairs or in the lockers.

**Max:** Damn, maybe he's hiding in his dorm.

**Chloe:** Then let’s bail. Nathan can’t hide anymore.

*Max and Chloe start to walk towards the exit. Mr. Jefferson blocks them.*

**Mr. Jefferson:** So you made it, Max.

**Max:** Oh, hey, Mr. Jefferson...

**Mr. Jefferson:** Um... are you both okay? You look like you're on a mission...

**Max:** Oh, I was just looking for Nathan.

**Mr. Jefferson:** Aha. I didn't know you were pals with him. I haven't seen him since this afternoon... He seemed pretty upset. I think he's still quite upset over the whole Kate situation.

**Max:** Yeah, that makes sense.

**Mr. Jefferson:** Let's talk later, Max. I have to announce the winner of the contest. I do wish you would have entered. You have to build up that résumé and portfolio, but I know you will.

**Max:** Thanks, I hope so.

**Mr. Jefferson:** Okay, excuse me. I’m almost on...

**Chloe:** Let’s get the hell out of here, Max.

''Chloe puts her hand on Max's back and they leave the VIP area. Mr. Jefferson walks over to the DJ booth and takes the microphone.''

### **"Everyday Heroes" Contest**# 

**Mr. Jefferson:** Okay, everybody calm down. Thank you, thank you... I appreciate it. I don't want to get in the way of the party, but it's time to announce the winner of the "Everyday Heroes" contest.

''Max stops to watch. Chloe, annoyed, grabs Max's wrist and unsuccessfully tries to pull her towards the exit.''

**Mr. Jefferson:** Before I do, I want to thank everybody who entered their photograph... and everybody who thought about entering. Now, this is the most important step in being an artist—sharing your work with the world. All of you represent Blackwell Academy, and everything our school stands for. As far as I'm concerned, you're all "Everyday Heroes"! The envelope, please... And the winner is… Oh my, what a shocker... Victoria Chase!

**Victoria:** Oh my God!

*Victoria takes the microphone from Mr. Jefferson.*

**Victoria:** Thank you so much, Mr. Jefferson. It was your incredible photography that brought me to Blackwell and I hope I can live up to your name... and fame. I also want to thank all the students for being so dedicated in their pursuit.

(Kate died)(Kate died)

**Victoria:** And I'd like to dedicate this prize to the memory of Kate Marsh... She was the real "everyday hero" of Blackwell...

|-|(Kate lived)# (Kate lived)

**Victoria:** And I'd like to dedicate this prize to Kate Marsh... She is the real "everyday hero" of Blackwell. And I can't wait for her to come back.

**Victoria:** Thank you.

**Stella:** You suck, Victoria!

**Max:** Victoria won. Big surprise. I can't believe she blackmailed Jefferson... Well... yes, I can.

**Chloe:** Who fucking cares? Rachel is still dead. And I want Nathan's punk ass... now!

**Max:** Me too. Let’s go check out the dormitories.

*Max and Chloe leave the party. Once outside, Chloe gets a text from Nathan that says:*
**glad you got one last look at rachel**
**nobody will ever find her again after im done**

**Chloe:** Oh Christ, Nathan just texted me... He says there won't be any evidence left after he's done.

**Max:** Shit, we have to go to the junkyard right now!

*Max and Chloe run to the truck. The scene fades out on the two moons, one of which is disappearing.*

###  **Junkyard - Evening** 

*The scene fades in on a puddle that reflects just one moon in the sky. Chloe stomps across it.*

**Max:** Stop stomping around, Chloe!

**Chloe:** Right. Just get ready to use your rewind fast if Nathan tries to jump us.

(If Max sees the rat in Chloe's hideout)(If Max sees the rat in Chloe's hideout)

**Max:** What the hell... Oh, gross!

**Idle Comments**

(Walking around the junkyard)# (Walking around the junkyard)

**Chloe:** Rachel, I will get your revenge... I swear...

**Chloe:** Come on, come on. Nathan needs to die now...

**Max:** For God’s sake, Chloe, you have to be quiet! We could die, okay?

|-|(Max is not near Chloe)(Max is not near Chloe)

**Chloe:** Are you looking for something back there? Catch up!

*Near the spot where Rachel is buried, there is a point which triggers the following cutscene. How it starts depends on who gets to this point first.*

(Chloe gets to it first)# (Chloe gets to it first)

*Chloe runs toward the spot where Rachel is buried.*

**Chloe:** Max, please hurry!

|-|(Max gets to it first)(Max gets to it first)

*Max approaches the spot where Rachel is buried. She looks at it, then beckons Chloe, who runs over.*

**Max:** Chloe, come over here, quick!

''They remove some of the earth covering Rachel's body.''

**Chloe:** Oh God, Max, look... she's still there.

*Max stands and slowly starts to back away.*

**Max:** Don’t look, Chloe…

*Someone appears behind Max and sticks a syringe in the back of her neck.*

**Max:** Oh no…

*Max falls to the ground. She unsuccessfully tries to use her rewind power.*

**Max:** Chloe! Look out!

*Chloe jumps up and turns around, grabbing the gun from her back pocket.*

**Chloe:** What the fuck? Even though this line still appears in the subtitles in the current version of the Remastered Edition, Chloe does not say it.

*Chloe is immediately shot in the head and killed. Max watches her fall to the ground in slow motion.*

**Max:** Chloe…

*The killer slowly walks over to Max. She looks up to see Mr. Jefferson looming over her.*
