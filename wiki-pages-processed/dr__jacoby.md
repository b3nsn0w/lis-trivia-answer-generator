#  Dr. Jacoby 

[File:drjacoby-letter.png](thumb.md)
**Dr. Jacoby** is [Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md)'s psychiatrist. He is only mentioned in a letter from him to [Sean Prescott](sean_prescott.md), in which he asks for consultation with Sean and his wife to be able to help Nathan as he feels disregards for his suggestions, which can be found in the [Episode 4: Dark Room (Location)](dark_room.md) in [Episode 4: Dark Room](episode_4.md). It reads as follows:

|Dear Mr. Prescott,

As Nathan's primary psychiatrist for over five years, I feel that I should stop seeing your son as you have disregarded my rather dire and immediate suggestion for his — and others' — well-being.

You know well the extent of Nathan's challenges but I feel that you refuse to acknowledge the role you play in his mental health.
If I do not have your support, I cannot treat Nathan, it is as simple as that. I fear he is becoming even more disconnected from reality, even if he acts in a personable manner. 

You have ignored my requests for a consultation with you and your wife so I have to assume you are no longer interested in my services.
Regardless, I care about Nathan and I believe he needs serious help.

If you would like to talk about this matter, I am always available.

Best,

Dr. Jacoby
