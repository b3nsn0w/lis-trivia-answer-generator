#  The Forks 

[File:Theforks.jpg](thumb.md)

**The Forks** posters appear to be all over town, even in places such as the [Prescott Dormitory](prescott_dormitories.md) at [Blackwell Academy](blackwell_academy.md) and [Chloe's Room](chloe_s_bedroom.md). It is unknown what *The Forks* is, though it appears to be very popular in [Arcadia Bay](arcadia_bay.md).

It is completely unknown what the poster references, although some suggest that the poster is for a local band or restaurant. However, the poster is most likely just a piece of filler added by the developers to create a more lived-in atmosphere for the game's world.

*The Forks* logo poster appears to be dirty around the edges, square, and white with a scared or startled sentient piece of food on the cover (most likely a peach or tomato). It has the name "The Forks" under it with a small fork logo.
