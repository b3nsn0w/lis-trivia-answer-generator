> This room is like Nathan's mind...

**[Maxine Caulfield**, Max Caulfield](maxine_caulfield____max_caulfield.md) in "[Episode 4: Dark Room, Dark Room](episode_4__dark_room__dark_room.md)"

'''Nathan's Room'* is number 111 in the male part of the [Prescott Dormitory](prescott_dormitory.md). It is an explorable location in *[Life is Strange](life_is_strange.md)'' during "[Episode 4: Dark Room](dark_room.md)" when [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) searches for proof of [Nathan Prescott](nathan_prescott.md)'s involvement in the [:Category:Dark Room Conspiracy](dark_room_conspiracy.md).

##  Appearance 
###  Exterior 
The slate outside room 111 reads "[Prescott Family](the_prescotts.md) rule this town" -- a show of power and outward aggression. If Max had saved [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md) in "[Episode 2: Out of Time](out_of_time.md)", Kate will text Nathan's room number to Max after the latter visited her at the [hospital](hospital.md), but Max can easily establish this room to be Nathan's from the slate message alone.

Max uses the nearby fire extinguisher to bust open the locked door of the room. She can [Rewind](rewind.md) to repair the damage if she likes, once she's inside.

###  Interior 
The first notable thing about Nathan's room is that it appears to be very dark due to the closed blinds over the windows. It reinforces the suggestion that Nathan is the brooding and moody type.

To the left of the door, near his bed, is a commode with his clothing. Inside one of the drawers, Max finds a threatening note from [Chloe Price](chloe_price.md) arranging their meeting in the Blackwell bathroom, as well as a horrifying picture of Chloe while drugged. A broken lamp and Nathan's prescription drugs are situated on the bedside table.

If [Pompidou](pompidou.md) was hurt during the previous episode, a macabre photo of the injured dog lying on the road can be found on the bed.

To the right of the door is a desk with expensive photo equipment: a brand new monochrome camera and a new lens.

On the wall beside this desk is a certificate Nathan got from [Sean Prescott](his_father.md) when he was little, certifying that he is the "best son in the world." This seems to imply that Nathan values the respect and admiration of his father and is desperately trying to redeem himself and win back the love he once had as a child.

On the right side of the desk is a black leather(?) couch. Above the couch, the screen from [Nathan's Computer](nathan_s_computer.md) is projected on the wall. Macabre black and white scenes similar to the old German Expressionism style form the screensaver of his PC and the images being projected.

Nathan's computer is located on the desk opposite the door. Beside it, there is a shelf with lots of horror DVDs and creepy photographs. Nathan even has a photo of Max on the wall near his bed which he stole if you accused him and he broke into [Max's Room](max_s_room.md) earlier. Under his bed, there is a pornographic magazine; Max comments that he is an all-American teen in that regard. However, the bondage portrait photographs on his wall suggest he also has a BDSM fetish or are foreshadowing of the [Dark Room (Location)](dark_room.md).

##  Episode Four - "[Episode 4: Dark Room](dark_room.md)" 
Max can explore the room and use Nathan's PC to glean more insight into his troubles and involvement in the drugging of Blackwell Academy girls. She can find a thoughtful email from his sister [Kristine Prescott](kristine.md) as well as unsupportive notes from his father and some conversations with [Victoria Chase](victoria_chase.md) about what she plans to wear to the [Vortex Club](vortex_club.md)'s upcoming [End of the World Party](party.md).

There are the scratch marks by the couch as a result of the couch being pulled away from the wall. Interaction with these marks is only available after Max has interacted with several items in the room first. She moves the couch to find Nathan's hidden stash of information, as well as his phone. She takes the zip-lock bag and departs the room to find Chloe.
