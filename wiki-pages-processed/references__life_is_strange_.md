#  References (Life is Strange) 

This article lists **references** to pop culture and different media that can be found in *[Life is Strange](life_is_strange.md)*. As the game revolves around [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md), a teenager at a [Blackwell Academy](senior_school.md) for arts and science, there are a lot of pop-cultural, artistic and scientific references throughout the game. Many of those references are quite elusive and old-school, and reflect inspirations for the development of the game, or are nods towards other artists.

: *See here for specific information on [Artistic References](artistic_references.md).*

##  General Influences 
There are some media that heavily influenced and inspired *Life is Strange*, as evident by the parallels between the game's plot and setting and those works. Numerous references to these main inspirations can be found throughout the game.

### Twin Peaks
* The plot of *{{Wiki|Twin Peaks}}* also takes place in the Pacific Northwest and is centered around the mysterious disappearance of Laura Palmer, a well-liked teenage girl, which mirrors [Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md), prior to the series start.
* Both *Life is Strange* and *Twin Peaks* work with the "quiet town with secrets" trope.
* The "[Dark Room (Location)](dark_room.md)" where Rachel was taken and the curtains separating the storage room from the actual studio as well as the red curtains Max crosses when entering the Vortex Club party are references to the Black Lodge from *Twin Peaks*.
* The implication that Jefferson is shifting his attention to [Victoria Chase](victoria_chase.md), who wins the [Everyday Heroes Photo Contest](everyday_heroes_photo_contest.md), is similar to how the *Twin Peaks* villain kidnapped the winner of the Miss Twin Peaks pageant, which is in any case, a parallel to the Everyday Heroes Photo Contest.
* In the Dark Room, a letter to Sean Prescott addressing Nathan's mental health is signed by a [Dr. Jacoby](dr__jacoby.md), which is the name of a psychiatrist in *Twin Peaks*.
* Mark Jefferson states that his orchestration of the Dark Room crimes stems from an obsession to capture the loss of innocence and youth. BOB and the other spirits of the Black Lodge in *Twin Peaks* feed on 'garmonbozia', a physical representation of pain and suffering, which they must torment people to create.
* The Double R Diner could be the inspiration for the Two Whales Diner.
* In the bathroom in the [Two Whales Diner](two_whales_diner.md), "fire walk with me" is written, a reference to the movie *Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me*, the prequel to the original series.
* The [Diner Cop](police_officer.md) is similar to the character Dale Cooper from the series, who also very consistently praised pies from the local café. In the game, the officer praises [Joyce Price](joyce_price.md)'s pumpkin pies at the Two Whales Diner.
* [File:Deputy Andy Brennan Twin Peaks - Officer Anderson Berry.jpg](thumb.md) [Anderson Berry](officer_anderson_berry.md) appears to be modeled after deputy [w:c:twinpeaks:Andy Brennan](andy_nbsp_brennan.md) from *Twin Peaks*. Apart from general similar looks, they share the same first name (Anderson, shortened to Andy) and even the prominent mole on the exact same spot, on the right, slightly above the mouth.
* The white horse in *Twin Peaks* which is featured in scenes with Laura Palmer is a mirror of the doe that appears in reference to Rachel Amber.
* Chloe's car license plate is TWNPKS (Twin Peaks).
* Laura Palmer and Rachel Amber share the same birthday, July 22nd.
* If Max tells David about Chloe's murder in Episode 5, he shoots and kills Jefferson. Twin Peaks has a similar situation with Leland Palmer smothering Jacques Renault, whom he thought responsible for his daughter's murder.
* In the [Max's Nightmare](nightmare_sequence.md) before the final decision, there are three very Black Lodge-esque moments: The presence of Doppelgängers of Max's friends and acquaintances which torture her psychologically, a throwback to the academy hallway at the start of Episode 1 where all the dialogue and hover text is backwards, and a seemingly endless cycle when Max goes through the doors of her dorm's corridor only to find she is back in the same place she started from (unless she manages to go through the right doors). Regarding the latter, this seemingly endless cycle happened with Agent Cooper when he walked through the curtains from waiting room to waiting room (a.k.a. the red room). Each room looked the same, but sometimes little things changed or appeared.
* [Samuel Taylor](samuel_taylor.md)'s character may be an analog to the character of the Log Lady in *{{wiki|Twin Peaks}}* - a TV show that [Michel Koch](michel_koch.md) says is his top favorite.[https://youtu.be/7DGgxSbRWio?t# 840 Gamespot interview E3 2015]. Similarly to the Log Lady, Samuel is seen as a strange, creepy or quirky character and has a seemingly supernatural connection to the town with an uncanny insight into its mysteries.
* Rachel Amber was secretly seeing a male (Jefferson). In Twin Peaks, inside Laura Palmer's nonsecret diary (the one the police first obtain), she wrote, "Nervous about meeting J tonight." A plastic letter "J" was also found in Laura’s stomach during forensic examination.
* Rachel Amber was thought of as a model student, with hardly anyone knowing she was involved with drugs or even a drug dealer. However, there were a few who knew about her wilder side or at least heard rumors. Nathan Prescott (who was known to run drugs in the school to other students) said Rachel "partied like a fiend on her own." In Twin Peaks, inside Laura Palmer's nonsecret diary was an envelope containing traces of cocaine. This surprised the local Sheriff who did not think of her as a drug user. One of the men she was seeing, Leo Johnson, describes her as a "wild girl." Even Laura's psychiatrist, Dr. Jacoby, stated "she was living a double life." Another older man states that Laura always got her way, yet many people in town thought she was perfect.
* Rachel's suspicious behavior was reported by Blackwell's head of security, and she was found with pharmaceuticals on campus. In Twin Peaks, drugs were being sold at the school, and it is believed Laura Palmer was one of the students being given drugs there.
* Rachel Amber was keeping things from even her closest female friend, Chloe Price. In the *Fire Walk With Me* movie, Laura Palmer says to James Hurley, a boy she has been seeing: "You don't even know me. There are things about me... Even Donna doesn’t know me." (Donna being her best friend).
* According to a crumpled-up letter found in the junkyard, Rachel wrote that she is obsessed with a guy who is "wise and unconventional" and "kind of scary, not in a 'bad boy' way." This turns out to be Mr. Jefferson, who is a mature male in a position of authority who should know better than to get involved with a student. In Twin Peaks, Laura Palmer teases and confides her dark secrets to her psychiatrist, Dr. Jacoby - another mature man in a position of authority who should know better than to get intimately involved with a patient.
* The video footage of Laura Palmer dancing with her best friend, taken by somebody else, is similar to the photo of Rachel and Chloe who appear to be dancing, also taken by somebody else.
* Rachel Amber wears a Native-American-inspired turquoise feather earring in one ear only. In Twin Peaks, a Native-American police deputy wears a turquoise earring in one ear only and the same ear throughout the majority of Seasons 1 and 2.
* Sean Prescott and his development plans for Arcadia Bay may have been inspired by the head of the Horne family who is a rich property developer in town, who schemes to take over the local saw mill to knock it down for redevelopment. The saw mill is an important source of economy to the Twin Peaks town folk, just like how the fishing industry is important to Arcadia Bay yet has been threatened by Prescott activity in the area.
* Frank was rumored to have taken a blood oath with Rachel. Two characters in Twin Peaks of the opposite sex also took a blood oath.
* Jefferson is wearing white surgical gloves when he drugs Max. The main villain and killer of Laura Palmer puts on white surgical gloves upon drugging his wife.
* Max meets what could be her shadow self in the diner during her nightmare - a doppelgänger. She has to stand up to this "shadow self" who attempts to make her see a darker, selfish side to herself. In Twin Peaks, the Native-American police deputy describes the Black Lodge as a place where every spirit must pass through on a way to perfection. It is there that you meet your shadow self: "The Dweller on the Threshold." The deputy goes on to say that "if you confront the Black Lodge with imperfect courage, it will utterly annihilate your soul."
* When Max meets her doppelgänger in the diner of her nightmare, it raises the question as to whether the doppelgänger knows the real truth behind her nature or whether it is trying to send a darker, more selfish version of Max back to the real world. In Twin Peaks, Agent Cooper finds he has a doppelgänger in the waiting room (red room). He becomes possessed by this evil entity, and his good soul is trapped while his bad double goes back to reality.
* There is a fan theory that Max is trapped in purgatory and that the point where she wakes up in the forest at the start of the game is an endless cycle. This is also the area where she later has to make a choice between two paths. In Twin Peaks, Major Briggs states that "fear and love open the doors" to the two different lodges: fear for the Black Lodge, and love for the White Lodge. The forest in Twin Peaks is where the two worlds meet.
* Deer feature prominently in Life is Strange as a spirit animal. In the world of Twin Peaks, it is said that "gentle fawns gamboled [in the White Lodge] amidst happy, laughing spirits."
* There is a truck driver in Life is Strange who refers to Rachel Amber as a gold digger, which suggests she may have tried to use him in exchange for something she wants (whether this is likely to be a ride to L.A. or something else). In Twin Peaks, it is revealed that Laura Palmer gives sex to a truck driver in exchange for cocaine.
* Chloe Price described Rachel as her angel. Angels appear in *Fire Walk With Me* both in the form of a painting and people. In *The Missing Pieces* (a movie-length collection of missing scenes from *Fire Walk With Me*), a scene with Doc Hayward shows him reading a secret message for Laura: "The angels will return, and when you see the one that is meant to help you, you will weep with joy."

###  The Butterfly Effect 
* The protagonists of *The Butterfly Effect* trilogy all have the ability to visit and alter their past through devices like photographs (or diaries, films) and so create different timelines/realities like Max who can use photographs.
* The protagonist of *{{Wiki|The Butterfly Effect}}*, the first movie of the trilogy, Evan, suffers from headaches, unconsciousness and nosebleeds caused by overusing his ability like Max (though the reason here differs from simply overusing; Evan's brain has to deal with additional memories from all the alternative timelines he creates, whereas Max's brain seems just to be over-challenged by rewinding too much or the attempt of rewinding too far).
* Just like Max, Evan moved away from his hometown when he was 13 leaving his childhood friend behind. They fell out of touch and when he meets her again years later, he has to realize how messed up her life has become since he disappeared from her life. When she, shortly after seeing each other for the first time after all these years, dies, Evan uses his power to prevent her death and tries to change her past for the better.
* Evan changes a major event in his and his childhood friend's past and so creates a new timeline inadvertently resulting in someone ending up permanently in a wheelchair, exactly like in the [Alternative Timeline (Life is Strange)](alternative_timeline.md) Max creates at the end of Episode 3 (though, here it is the protagonist himself that ends up in a wheelchair).
* Evan creates another timeline where his alter ego appears to be the opposite of his personality, member of a popular and elitist social group and friends with people he never would've befriended, which is another aspect of the alternate timeline created by Max in which she is a member of the popular Vortex Club and friends with Nathan and Victoria.
* Halfway through Episode 5, Max wakes up in a timeline where she's back in the Dark Room and cannot escape using her powers because Jefferson burned her diary and photos. Similarly, in the climax of the film, Evan wakes up in a timeline where he's in a mental institution and cannot escape because in this timeline his diaries (his medium for time travel) don't exist.
* At the end of the story Evan has to let go of the person he desperately tried to save throughout the whole story to create a morally acceptable timeline, which resembles the Sacrifice Chloe ending.
* Every time Evan and Max change something in the past, there is a [Timestream](photo_montage.md) of old and new memories that replace each other in the new timeline.
* The Dark Room mirrors the basement of the protagonist's childhood friend's father who wanted to take illicit videos of his daughter and Evan when they were younger. The cuts and transitions that occur when Evan regains consciousness after his blackouts or when going back to this scene resemble the ones that occur in *Life is Strange* when Max is waking up/regaining consciousness in the Dark Room scenes with Jefferson wanting to take pictures of her.

###  Donnie Darko 
* Both *Life is Strange* and *{{Wiki|Donnie Darko}}* shares the approach of {{Wiki|Parallel Universes|Tangent Universes}} and the general idea of time travel.
* A common central theme of *{{Wiki|Donnie Darko}}* is the idea of sacrificing one person to save a small American town. In the film, it's the protagonist Donnie that is sacrificed.
* Middlesex and Arcadia Bay are both destroyed by a time vortex resembling a tornado.
* Both in *Life is Strange* and *Donnie Darko* features a well-respected male figure with a secret history of abuse and predation for which he gets busted.
* The first scene of the film shows Donnie waking up from a previous iteration of the time-loop he is stuck into: he gets up off the ground, alone, confused, in a remote area over looking his town, having no clue how he ended up there. This is strikingly similar to what happens to Max in the very first scene of the game.
* In Episode 1, there is a drawing of [w:c:villains:Frank (Donnie Darko)](frank_the_rabbit.md) from *Donnie Darko* on Max's notebook. Frank Bowers' first name is also believed to be a reference to this character.
* In Episode 2, a car license plate in the [Blackwell Parking Lot](blackwell_parking_lot.md) of the Two Whales reads DNNDRK (Donnie Darko).
* In Episode 2, it is shown that Max has a copy of *Donnie Darko* in her room.
* In Episode 2 and *Donnie Darko*, there are scenes involving shooting at glass bottles for target practice.

###  Blue is the Warmest Colour 
*Both *Life is Strange* and *{{wiki|Blue Is the Warmest Color (comics)|Blue is the Warmest Colour}}* are coming of age stories about an introverted girl falling for a wild blue-haired girl who appears to be her polar opposite in interests and personality.*[File:Clementine-emma-bleu-est-une-couleur.jpg](thumb.md)*
*Both revolve around LGBT themes.
*Clementine and Emma from the graphic novel version of *Blue is the Warmest Colour* look nearly identical to Max and Chloe from *Life is Strange*.
*It's very likely that Max keeping a diary is inspired by the diary Clementine keeps that the graphic novel revolves around.

###  The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo 
* Both *Life is Strange* and *The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo* revolve around the search for a woman who has been missing for long period of time.
* Both villains keep documentation of their victims in photos.
* Chloe's skull shirt from Episode 1 closely resembles the skull motif on Lisbeth's shirt in the Swedish version of the movie.
* A poster in Chloe's and Dana's rooms looks identical to the one used in a promo for the American movie version.
* Both villains own a sleek, high-tech dungeon for imprisoning and photographing their victims, who are all young women.
* Both Nathan Prescott and Martin Vanger acquired their psychopathic tendencies from their fathers. In the game, Nathan Prescott develops his psychotic urges as a reaction to his father's overbearing expectations. It could also be argued that Mr. Jefferson becomes a surrogate father for Nathan and tries to teach him to funnel his anger into his sadistic artwork, but is inevitably unable to control him.

###  Stephen King 
During a CNC conference about realism in video games that was held in June 2015, Cano confirmed that {{Wiki|Stephen King}}'s work was a source of inspiration in the creation of the game's plot and its universe.[https://www.lesnumeriques.com/jeux-video/reel-dans-jeu-video-representation-experience-a2225.html Le réel dans le jeu vidéo : représentation et expérience] (June27, 2015) Several references to Stephen Kinng's novels can be found in the game.
* In the parking lot Max spots [Frank Bowers](frank_bowers.md)'s sleeping dog and calls it "{{Wiki|Cujo}}". Cujo is a rabid canine and central character in the same-titled novel written by Stephen King.
* If Max talks to Justin at the Vortex Club party he'll refer to Max as "Maximum Overdrive", a reference to the same-titled Stephen King film.
* In Max's nightmare when sneaking behind Frank Bowers with a flashlight, he says, "Me and Rachel are floating down here in the sewer... Come on down!", which is a reference to Stephen King's *IT*.
* When entering the girls dorm for the first time, the first room on the right got "REDRUM" written on the whiteboard and that room has the number 217 (Stella Hill's room). Both number and the writing refer to the book *{{wiki|The Shining (novel)|The Shining}}* by Stephen King.

###  Gone Home 
* Creative director Jean-Maxime Moris and game and art director [Michel Koch](michel_koch.md) said they are fans of games like *Gone Home*, and Koch himself was even in contact with *The Fullbright Company* after the latter's game launched in 2013.[https://www.polygon.com/2014/8/14/6003109/remember-me-creators-next-game-looks-like-gone-home-with-time-travel Remember Me creator's next game looks like Gone Home with time travel] (August 14, 2014)
* Both games feature coming-of-age stories set in Oregon, U.S., that also rely heavily on environmental storytelling. The story revolves around the relationship between two teenagers, not unreminiscent of the relationship between Max and Chloe.
*A possible direct reference to *Gone Home* could be Arcadia Bay's location: in a postcard found in Chloe's room, we learn that Arcadia Bay's ZIP code is 97141. *Gone Home* takes place in Boon County, OR, which happens to have the same ZIP code. In real life, this ZIP code belongs to Tillamook, the area which directly inspired Arcadia Bay. It also confirms that *Life is Strange* and *Gone Home* aren't set in the same universe.

###  Buffy the Vampire Slayer 
* The big football event that is set to take place on the final day of the game (Friday, October 11th) is between the [Bigfoots](blackwell_bigfoots.md) and the Sunnydale Razorbacks (as seen on a flyer that lists the scheduled games with full team names). Sunnydale is a fictional Californian town on the TV series *{{Wiki|Buffy the Vampire Slayer}}*.
*According to an [https://youtu.be/7DGgxSbRWio?t14m5s interview with Gamespot], Co-game Director Michel Koch states that his second-favorite TV show of all time is *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*. (His first is *Twin Peaks*.)
* A couple of the characters in *Life is Strange* were inspired by characters from *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*. (See the *Characters* section below.)
* In Episode 1, a vehicle license plate of "BFFVMPRSLR" references the show in the Blackwell parking lot.

Sunnydale_reference.png|Game schedule flyer with the *Sunnydale* reference.

### Soundtrack Inspiration
* The music in *Life is Strange* appears to be heavily influenced by {{Wiki|Friday_Night_Lights_(TV_series)|Friday Night Lights}}. Not only is much of the music in a very similar mood and sound, but they actually closely share many of the same artists. Both feature music by {{Wiki|José_González_(singer)|José González}}, {{Wiki|Bright_Eyes_(band)|Bright Eyes}}, {{Wiki|Mogwai|Mogwai}}, and {{Wiki|Sparklehorse}}.

##  Scientific References 
[File:Max_Theories_about_Time_and_Time_Travel.jpg](thumb.md)One of the things *[Life is Strange](life_is_strange.md)* is full of, is scientific references, focused of course, around scientifically controversial issues about time travel, its paradoxes and "what", "why" and "how" does Max Caulfield a seemingly "normal" teenager, can bend time and space. There are a lot of references to modern science and possible explanations for [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md)'s rewinding power.

###  Butterfly Effect 
The {{Wiki|Butterfly Effect}} itself is "branch" of chaos theory, that theorizes about the sensitive dependence on initial conditions in which a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state. The Butterfly Effect is a recurring theme in *Life is Strange*. Besides the blue butterfly which symbolizes the butterfly effect amongst other things, this theory is referred several times by several characters including Max, Chloe and Warren.

###  Chaos Theory 
{{wiki|Chaos Theory}} is a branch of mathematics focusing on the behavior of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. "Chaos" is an interdisciplinary theory stating that within the apparent randomness of chaotic complex systems, there are underlying patterns, constant feedback loops, repetition, self-similarity, fractals, self-organization, and reliance on programming at the initial point known as sensitive dependence on initial conditions. Besides the namesake episode there are several characters that refer to the Chaos Theory directly or indirectly.

###  Grandfather Paradox 
In contrary to general popular belief, the {{Wiki|Grandfather paradox}} doesn't refer only the old riddle "If I go back in time and kill my grandfather when he was a kid, I can never born, so how did I went back in time and killed my grandfather?". This is just the most intriguing question proposed, the paradox itself revolves around the fact that any action that alters the past, since there is a contradiction whenever the past becomes different from the way it was. Therefore, the Grandfather paradox is present throughout the game.

###  Law of Thermodynamics 
The {{wiki|Laws of Thermodynamics}} define physical quantities like temperature, energy, and entropy that characterize thermodynamic systems at thermal equilibrium. The laws describe how these quantities behave under various circumstances, and preclude the possibility of certain phenomena such as perpetual motion. The only reference found in the game is a written statement by Max claiming that they can obviously be broken.

###  Multiverse Theory 
The {{wiki|Multiverse Theory}} also known as an omniverse or meta-universe, is a hypothetical group of multiple universes. Together, these universes comprise everything that exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, energy, and the physical laws and constants that describe them. The different universes within the multiverse are called "parallel universes", "other universes", or "alternate universes". Obviously this is one of Max's conundrums, as she often wonders about what happens to the original reality she just altered, the more prominent case being the "alternative reality timeline".

###  Newton's Laws of Motion 
{{wiki|Newton's Laws of Motion}} are three physical laws that, together, laid the foundation for classical mechanics. They describe the relationship between a body and the forces acting upon it, and its motion in response to those forces. More precisely, the first law defines the force qualitatively, the second law offers a quantitative measure of the force, and the third asserts that a single isolated force doesn't exist. Warren makes a direct reference to Newton's third law when in Episode 5, he states "For every action there is a reaction."

###  Quantum Entanglement 
{{wiki|Quantum Entanglement}} is a physical phenomenon that occurs when pairs or groups of particles are generated, interact, or share spatial proximity in ways such that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently of the state of the others, even when the particles are separated by a large distance. After pulling an all-nighter to research about her power, thanks to one of the bases of this physical phenomenon, Max arrives to the conclusion "...that time as a FRAGILE FOUNDATION. Nothing is written in stone."

###  Schrödinger's Cat 
{{wiki|Schrödinger's cat}} is a thought experiment, sometimes described as a paradox, devised by Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1935. It illustrates what he saw as the problem of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics applied to everyday objects. The scenario presents a hypothetical cat that may be simultaneously both alive and dead, a state known as a quantum superposition, as a result of being linked to a random subatomic event that may or may not occur. Schrödinger's cat is present throughout the game and in several ways and forms. Max writes about it after pulling an all-nighter to research, Warren makes a joke in a message to Max and you may even consider the Sacrifice Arcadia Bay ending, as a Schrödinger's cat example, everybody is alive and dead until one is asserted.

###  Strange Attractors 
In the mathematical field of dynamical systems, Strange Attractors are a kind of {{wiki|Attractor}}. An attractor is called strange if it has a fractal structure. This is often the case when the dynamics on it are chaotic, but strange non chaotic attractors also exist. If a strange attractor is chaotic, exhibiting sensitive dependence on initial conditions, then any two arbitrarily close alternative initial points on the attractor, after any of various numbers of iterations, will lead to points that are arbitrarily far apart (subject to the confines of the attractor), and after any of various other numbers of iterations will lead to points that are arbitrarily close together. Thus, a dynamic system with a chaotic attractor is locally unstable yet globally stable: once some sequences have entered the attractor, nearby points diverge from one another but never depart from the attractor. Chloe calls Max the perfect example of a Strange Attractor.

###  Tourism in Time 
Tourism in Time or Time Tourists is a term usually used to describe the presence of people or objects with anachronisms in photos or other images, one of the most famous being a woman with a cellphone in a Charlie Chaplin movie. The term rose to fame after Dr. {{wiki|Stephen Hawking}} referred it in a lecture. Max after pulling an all-nighter to do research on her power arrives to the conclusion, at least one of them, that she may be one of Hawking's fabled Time Tourists.

###  Wormhole Theory 
At a given time Max can use her laptop for research about her power, after opening a page about {{Wiki|Wormhole}} Theory, she will comment on how that theory makes sense. If taken into account how her power works during the rewind Max may actually be right. She may indeed open a wormhole in the fabric of time, (not space), allowing her to go back in time and not to have moved at all in space. This would also explain why pause rewind is harder for Max to perform, in Kate's rescue, under this theory when she pauses time, she actually has to open a wormhole in the fabric space/time as she needs to move herself as well. Further, supporting this theory, is the fact that the rewind position in the timeline is indicated by a "swirl meter" that resembles a crude drawing of a wormhole in the corner of the screen.

##  Characters 

###  Max Caulfield 
* [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md)'s surname is a reference to Holden Caulfield, the protagonist of the {{Wiki|J. D. Salinger}} novel *{{Wiki|The Catcher in the Rye}}*, a student at an exclusive boarding school like Max, and an icon for teenage rebellion and angst.This reference was confirmed in an [http://www.siliconera.com/2015/02/05/life-strange-director-talks-theme-identity-visual-novels/ interview] with Creative Director [Jean-Maxime Moris](jean_maxime_moris.md). Both have similar personality traits such as the urge to preserve innocence. A central aspect of *The Catcher in the Rye* is the dilemma of Holden's state in between adolescence and adulthood. There are several other references to that book throughout the game, such as "the WINGER and the COW" poster in [Max's Room](max_s_room.md) which has a very similar style to the cover of *The Catcher in the Rye*, or the red cap in the principal's secretary office which resembles the hat Holden wears; she also calls it "phony" which is a characteristic word used many times by Holden in the novel.
* Max might also be based on Clementine/Adele from the French graphic novel and film *{{Wiki|Blue Is the Warmest Color (comics)|Blue is the Warmest Color}}*. Both are young queer women coming of age with similar hair who fall for a wild blue haired girl. The graphic novel version of their retrospective characters look nearly identical.

###  Chloe Price 
* [Chloe Price](chloe_price.md)'s character might be based on {{Wiki|Lisbeth Salander}} from *{{Wiki|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (disambiguation)|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo}}*. The female protagonist has a very similar attitude and punk rock style like Chloe; she has the same badass attitude, short colored hair, tattoos and piercings, wears boots and skull motifs. A poster in Chloe's room looks identical to the one used in a promo for the American movie. Chloe's skull shirt from Episode 1 closely resembles the skull motif on Lisbeth's shirt in the Swedish version. Though it's not directly linked to Chloe, Rachel's dragon tattoo is very similar to the dragon image on the Swedish version's film cover.
* Chloe might also be based on Emma from the French graphic novel and film *{{Wiki|Blue Is the Warmest Color (comics)|Blue is the Warmest Color}}*. Both characters are punkish, rebellious teenage girls with short blue hair and are queer who falls in with a girl who is seen as their opposite in personality. The graphic novel versions of their retrospective characters look nearly identical.
* It's possible that Chloe is partly inspired by the protagonist of the old animated MTV series *Daria*. Daria Morgendorffer is a smart, acerbic, and somewhat misanthropic teenage girl who observes the world around her. The phrase "Everybody Lies, No Exceptions" that is written on Chloe's wall is a line from the old animated MTV series *Daria*. Chloe is even drawn in a cool little Daria style next to it.

###  Mark Jefferson 
* [Mark Jefferson](mark_jefferson.md)'s character is possibly based on Patrick Wilson's character Jeff Kohlver from the movie *{{Wiki|Hard_Candy_(film)|Hard Candy}}*. In the movie, Jeff Kohlver is a pedophile who lures teenage girls back to his apartment under the pretense of doing modeling for him. He then uses that opportunity to take advantage of them. Later in the movie, Jeff admits to photographing another man as he raped and killed another girl. Both Mr. Jefferson and Jeff Kohlver are stylish, charismatic men in their early thirties with careers in photography. Their appearances are very similar - both have short brown hair, light beards, and are in good shape for their age. They both also wear thick-framed glasses and smart casual clothing such as suit jackets. Jeff Kohlver's plans are ultimately foiled by 14-year-old Hayley Stark, echoing Mr. Jefferson's downfall at the hands of Max.
* Jefferson's name might be based on {{Wiki|Mark Jefferson (geographer)|an American geographer and cartographer}} or {{Wiki|Mark Jefferson (cricketer)|a New Zealand cricketer}} who are both called Mark Jefferson.

###  Victoria Chase 
* It is possible that the name "[Victoria Chase](victoria_chase.md)" was chosen as a nod towards {{Wiki|Joss Whedon}}, given that Victoria has the same name as and fills an equivalent role to character {{Wiki|Cordelia Chase}} from *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*.

###  Warren Graham 
*According to Artistic Director Michel Koch, [Warren Graham](warren_graham.md)'s character is inspired by {{Wiki|Xander Harris}} from *Buffy the Vampire Slayer* who "has this kind of awkwardness in him and is always saying the wrong things, but he's a good guy".[http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/first-love-and-awkwardness-inside-the-mind-of-life-is-strange-co-director-michel-koch-423 First Love and Awkwardness: Inside the Mind of ‘Life Is Strange’ Co-Director Michel Koch] (August 4, 2015)

###  Kate Marsh 
* The combination of [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md) 's middle and last name may be a reference to the character Beverly Marsh in {{Wiki|Stephen King}}'s *{{Wiki|It (novel)|IT}}*.
* Kate's rabbit [Alice the Rabbit](alice.md) may have been a reference to the white rabbit in *{{Wiki|Alice in Wonderland}}* that leads Alice to Wonderland.

###  Zachary Riggins 
*[Zachary Riggins](zachary_riggins.md) 's last name, "Riggins" is a reference to NBC primetime drama, *Friday Night Lights*. [Mark Jefferson](mark_jefferson.md)' s voice actor, [Derek Phillips](derek_phillips.md)  starred in the series as a character named Billy Riggins.

###  Frank Bowers 
*[File:Hitman from Mulholland Drive - Frank Bowers.jpg](thumb.md) [Frank Bowers](frank_bowers.md) seems to be modeled after the Hitman from *Mulholland Drive*.
*His last name may be a reference to {{Wiki|Stephen King}}'s* {{Wiki|It (novel)|IT}}* where the leader of the bullies is named Henry Bowers. Frank's first name is believed to be a reference to "[w:c:villains:Frank (Donnie Darko)](frank_the_rabbit.md)" from *Donnie Darko*.
* Frank's RV has the number plate "BRKBD", a reference to the television show *{{Wiki|Breaking Bad}}*, in which drug dealer Walter and his accomplice Jesse cook Crystal Meth in an RV.

###  David Madsen 
*[David Madsen](david_madsen.md)'s character design may be based on a composite sketch from the first season of the *X-Files* which very closely resembles David's faceSee here for a comparison: [http://lifeisstrangegame.tumblr.com/post/119525570124/shutupandtakethisurl-i-was-watching-x-files http://lifeisstrangegame.tumblr.com/post/119525570124/shutupandtakethis]. It's pretty likely since Artistic Director Michel Koch is a big fan of this series and there are several other references throughout the game.

###  Dana Ward 
*[Dana Ward](dana_ward.md)'s first name might be a reference to the main character Dana Scully from the TV series *X-Files*.

###  Samuel Taylor 
*[Samuel Taylor](samuel_taylor.md)'s character may be an analog to the character of the Log Lady in *Twin Peaks*. Like the Log Lady, Samuel is seen as a strange, creepy, or quirky character, and has a seemly supernatural connection to the town with uncanny insight into its mysteries.

###  Rachel Amber 
*[Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md) is likely based on Laura Palmer, a well-liked teenage girl whose mysterious disappearance sets off the plot of *Twin Peaks*. Laura Palmer and Rachel Amber share the same birthday, July 22nd.

###  Officer Anderson Berry 
* [File:Deputy Andy Brennan Twin Peaks - Officer Anderson Berry.jpg](thumb.md) The police officer is similar to the character Dale Cooper from the series *Twin Peaks*, who also very consistently praised pies from the local café. In the game, the officer praises Joyce Price's pumpkin pies at the Two Whales Diner.
* [Officer Berry](officer_anderson_berry.md) appears to be modeled after deputy [w:c:twinpeaks:Andy Brennan](any_brennan.md) from *Twin Peaks*. Apart from general similar looks, they share the same first name (Anderson, shortened to Andy) and even the prominent mole on the exact same spot, on the right, slightly above the mouth.

###  Other Residents 
* The [R.J. MacReady](fisherman.md) sitting immediately to the right of the diner door is the spitting image of Detective Holder from *The Killing*.
* The man standing next to the newspaper machines when Max first visits the diner appears to be modeled after {{Wiki|Christopher_Moltisanti|Christopher Moltisanti}} from *The Sopranos*.

##  Locations 

###  Arcadia Bay 
The developers conducted research on the setting by travelling to the Pacific Northwest for the purpose of conveying a nostalgic and autumnal feel to the game. The development team visited the region, took photographs, looked at local newspapers and used Google Street View to make sure the environment was accurately portrayed. There are a lot of locations [Arcadia Bay](arcadia_bay.md) is based off.

The name, Arcadia Bay, is heavily speculated to be named after the 90's play Arcadia, by Tom Stoppard. In the play, Stoppard examines the effects of time and how the decisions we make affect the people of the future, which is a common theme found in the game.

(TBC)

###  Two Whales Diner 
[File:Blue Moon Diner.jpg](thumb.md)
The Two Whales Diner likely is based on the Blue Moon Diner, located in {{Wiki|Beaverton, Oregon}}. The interior is incredibly similar, and there is a newspaper article in the [Plane](airplane.md) in Episode 5 with the headline "Two Moon Diner?" which connects the names of the two diners with each other. Fun fact: The official website of the Blue Moon Diner says "Welcome fellow time travelers" in the upper-left corner and someone posed as Max Caulfield in the comments, stating, "Couldn't decide between the Bacon omelette and the Belgian waffle, they're both hella good." This is a reference to Max's decision in Episode 2. Another comment, made by someone posing as Chloe Price says, "Come here all the time with my bestfriend. Love the bacon omelette its hella amazing." And someone else pretending to be Warren Graham stated, "Love this place! Me and my [Everyday Heroes Photo Contest](everyday_hero.md) always make sure to hit up this diner for an early dinner before heading off to the drive-in. Those Belgian waffles are hella tasty!"Official Blue Moon Diner website: http://bluemoondinerpdx.com/

###  [Dark Room (Location)](dark_room.md) 
[File:Guro_Illustration_Wall_Next_to_Screen_Dark_Room.png](thumb.md)
A signed {{Wiki|Ero guro}} illustration is framed on one of the walls, fitting the atmosphere.

##  Episode One - "[Episode 1: Chrysalis](chrysalis.md)" 
###  Vision 
*The beginning of "Chrysalis" mirrors, albeit marginally, the beginning of Remedy Entertainment's Xbox 360 launch title, *{{Wiki|Alan Wake}}*. In their dreams, both Max Caulfield and Alan Wake believe the point of safety is a lighthouse seen in the distance and the player is meant to walk towards it. 
* Another possible inspiration could be the very first scene of *Donnie Darko* where he is waking up from a previous iteration of the time-loop he is stuck into: he gets up off the ground, alone, confused, in a remote area overlooking his town, having no clue how he ended up there. This is exactly what also happened to Max in the very first scene of the game.

###  Blackwell Academy 
*Max mentions in her [Max's Diary](diary.md) that she borrowed the book *{{Wiki|The October Country}}* by {{Wiki|Ray Bradbury}} from [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md) and that she owns a copy of *{{Wiki|Battle Royale}}.*
*[File:Max's scribbles.png](thumb.md)The doodles on Max's notebook in Jefferson's class include the phrase "[w:c:gameofthrones:Winter is Coming (motto)](winter_is_coming.md)", which is a reference to the central motto of *{{Wiki|Game of Thrones}}*.It expresses the sentiment that there are always dark periods in each our lives, and even if things are good now ("summer"), we must always be ready for a dark period when events turn against us ("winter"). This can be considered a foreshadowing regarding the following dark events. There also seems to be a scribble of [w:c:villains:Frank (Donnie Darko)](frank_the_rabbit.md) from *Donnie Darko*. Frank The Rabbit is a person named Frank in a life-size demonic-looking rabbit costume who has the ability to move through time, and who warns Donnie, the protagonist of *Donnie Darko*, that the world is going to end in a specific amount of time. His objective is to guide Donnie in his path to correcting the timeline of the primary universe to prevent the world's destruction.
*At the beginning of the episode, Mr. Jefferson utters "Bueller", when no one volunteers to answer one of his questions, referring to the protagonist from the 1986 American teen comedy film ''{{Wiki|Ferris Bueller's Day Off}}'', a carefree teenager who pretends to be sick and skips school one beautiful spring day.
*During his lecture, Jefferson references several famous artists and their works: TBA
*When talking to Max, Mr. Jefferson recites {{Wiki|John Lennon}}'s famous quote, "Life is what happens while you're busy making other plans," when talking to Max in his classroom.
*When Max is answering to principal Wells "You look a little stressed out, are you okay?", she replies with, "I'm... I'm just a little worried about my... future," which is a clear reference to the 1967 movie *{{Wiki|The Graduate}}* where the protagonist uses that phrase when something is stressing or troubling him.
*On an [Steve Hackney](advertisement.md) for the formation of a band, which can be found in the Blackwell hallway, the following musicians are mentioned: {{Wiki|The Ramones}}, {{Wiki|The Shins}}, {{Wiki|The Beatles}}, {{Wiki|The White Stripes}}, {{Wiki|The Smiths}}, {{Wiki|The Who}}, {{Wiki|The Style Council}} and {{Wiki|Lady GaGa}}.
*The name of the person who hung up the advertisement might be a reference to Steve Hackney, a former UK rugby player.
*[File:Eye of providence.png](thumb.md){{Wiki|Eye of Providence|*The Eye of Providence*}}, also knows as the All-seeing Eye of God, appears at several places around the school. It can be seen all over Blackwell Academy's campus, for example in the girls' bathroom, the [Prescott Dormitory](prescott_dormitory.md), at the entrance of the parking lot. It also appears in Chloe's room.
*When looking at the window in Jefferson's classroom after rewinding for the first time, Max says she feels like she's in *{{Wiki|Groundhog Day}}*, a comedy movie about a man who is caught in a time loop and has to experience the same day again and again. Max also comments that her situation despite the resemblance to the film isn't funny referring to it being a comedy piece.
*When [Ms. Grant](ms__grant.md) refers to Blackwell "going back to 1984" when talking to Max about her anti-surveillance petition, she is referencing the {{Wiki|George Orwell}} novel *{{Wiki|Nineteen Eighty-Four}}*. Written in 1949, *Nineteen Eighty-Four* focused on omnipresent government surveillance and thus represents a parallel to David Madsen's planned surveillance at Blackwell.
*[Brooke Scott](brooke_scott.md)'s hoodie design from this episode is a reference to *Star Wars*, representing three light sabers, as officially confirmed by [Don't Nod](dontnod.md) on Twitter.DONTNOD confirmed this reference on [https://twitter.com/DONTNOD_Ent/status/727889665034989568 Twitter] on the 4th of May, 2016, the international {{Wiki|Star_Wars_Day|Star Wars Day}}. 
*The game Brooke is playing on her mobile phone in the first two episodes seems to be a racing game at first glance, but is actually a reference to the {{Wiki|Nerf}} brandMore in [https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/4xnvmp/this_is_what_brooke_plays_on_her_phone_when_we/ this reddit post]..
*Brooke's drone seems to be a HiFly drone, model B400 EVO. It has a similar shape and the same paintjob as the gunship character Trace flies in DONTNOD's first game *Remember Me*.
*The t-shirt [Justin Williams](justin_williams.md) wears in this episode is a reference to the 1975 shark attack thriller *{{Wiki|Jaws (film)|Jaws}}*, directed by {{Wiki|Steven Spielberg}}. It says "RAWS" and has a similar style to the film cover.
*Chloe's skull shirt from Episode 1 closely resembles the skull motif on Lisbeth's shirt in the Swedish version of the movie *The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo*, which is also the logo of the punk band *The Exploited*.

the girl with the dragon tattoo skull shirt.jpg|Lisbeth's shirt motif
Misfit Skull.jpg|Chloe's shirt motif

* The graffiti "hole to another universe" seen in Chloe's room seems to have been heavily inspired by a product made by the American designer Dan Golden in April 2012. Strangely enough, the same picture features a guitar almost identical to Max's and the [https://www.whatisblik.com/collections/dan-golden other products] from this designer all revolve around time-travel.

DG-HoleToAnotherUniverse.jpg|Dan Golden's hole to another universe's wall sticker

###  Prescott Dormitory 
*On the dormitory grounds, there is a scratch on a tree that reads "Make art, not war". This is a reference to the famous anti-war slogan.
*The message "REDⱭЯUM" on [Stella Hill](stella_hill.md)'s room slate and her room number being 217 are references to {{Wiki|The Shining (novel)|*The Shining*}}, a novel by {{Wiki|Stephen King}}; hence Max's comment about never going in there.[File:Poker Face Max.png](thumb.md)
*There is a reference to the [w:c:meme:Poker Face](_pokerface__meme.md) on Max's room slate.
*Victoria's room slate says, "Be the change you wish to see - {{Wiki|Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi}}".
*On the dorm hall's walls, [Brooke Scott](brooke_scott.md) has posted an advertisement for her Geek Grrls Book Club for which she intends to read and discuss fantasy and science fiction authors like {{Wiki|Ursula K. LeGuin|K. LeGuin}}, {{Wiki|Robin Hobb}}, {{Wiki|Neil Gaiman}}, {{Wiki|Piers Anthony}}, {{Wiki|Terry Brooks}}, {{Wiki|David Calvo}}, {{Wiki|Marion Zimmer Bradley}}.
* Another poster on the dorm's walls advertizes a gun club called Young Guns which is located at Heming Way. These could be references to the *{{Wiki|Young_Guns_(film)|Young Guns}}* movie and novelist {{Wiki|Ernest Hemingway}}.  
*The poster in Max's room for "the WINGER and the COW" has a very similar style and design to the cover of *The Catcher in the Rye* by J. D. Salinger.

the winger and the cow.jpg
the catcher in the rye cover.jpg

*Looking at her wardrobe Max mentions John Huges' movie *{{Wiki|Pretty in Pink}}*.
*In [Victoria's Room](victoria_s_dorm_room.md), Max sees her TV and says she'd like to sneak in and watch *{{Wiki|Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within}}*. The film was rendered by Square Pictures, a consolidated subsidiary of {{Wiki|Square Enix}}, the publisher of *Life is Strange*. However, Michel Koch said in an interview that Christine Divine actually thinks it is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made and wanted the reference to be in the game. Square Enix asked if they were sure about it.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v# xhxh3Iy_3Ic&t1h6m22s Life Is Strange Spoilercast - Kinda Funny Gamescast Special]
*A receipt showing the clerk's name as "{{Wiki|Amelia Pond}}" can be found in Victoria's room. This is a reference to one of the Doctor's companions in the British time travel series *{{Wiki|Doctor Who}}*.
*When Max rearranges Victoria's photos, she mentions {{Wiki|Tetris}}.
*When Max takes Warren's [Warren's Flash Drive](flash_drive.md) from [Dana's Room](dana_s_room.md), Max says, "Must protect my precious, so Max never has to chase it down again." It is a reference to how [w:c:lotr:Gollum](gollum.md) speaks in [w:c:lotr](_the_lord_of_the_rings_.md)*.*
*Warren's flash drive has pirated films and television shows including *{{Wiki|Doctor Who}}*, *{{Wiki|The X-Files}}*, *{{Wiki|Full Metal Alchemist}}*, *{{Wiki|Akira (film)|Akira}}*, *{{Wiki|The Twilight Zone}}*, *{{Wiki|Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!}}*, *{{Wiki|Tetsuo}}*, *{{Wiki|Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (film)}}*, *{{Wiki|Cannibal Holocaust}}*, *{{Wiki|Beneath the Valley of the Ultra-Vixens}}*, and *{{Wiki|Nekromantik|NEKRomantik}}.*
*Warren's science homework folder is called "Weird Science - Homework", a reference to the film *{{Wiki|Weird Science (film)|Weird Science}}*.
*In the Prescott Dormitory, on a board it says there will be a viewing of *{{Wiki|The Nightmare Before Christmas}}* on October 16th.
*On [Dana Ward](dana_ward.md)'s laptop, [Trevor](trevor.md) mentioned playing *[w:c:mariowiki](super_mario.md)*.
*On a poster by [Michelle Grant](michelle_grant.md) about surveillance, it says "Don't Let Big Brother Watch You". {{Wiki|Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother}} is a character or symbol in {{Wiki|George Orwell}}'s novel *{{Wiki|Nineteen Eighty-Four}}*, which is about a dystopian surveillance society.
*The student [Steve Hackney](steve_hackney.md) advertises a band on a noticeboard and states his influences are: {{Wiki|The Ramones}}, {{Wiki|The Shins}}, {{Wiki|The Beatles}}, {{Wiki|The White Stripes}}, {{Wiki|The Smiths}}, {{Wiki|The Who}}, {{Wiki|The Style Council}} and {{Wiki|Lady GaGa}}.

: [Some references Max makes to artists in her room might be missing]

###  Parking Lot 
*In the [Blackwell Parking Lot](parking_lot.md) of [Blackwell Academy](blackwell_academy.md), there are references to several television series on the license plates:

* Chloe's license plate "TWN PKS" is a reference to the 1990 drama *Twin Peaks,* an American television serial drama, which also takes place in Pacific Northwest and is centered around the mysterious disappearance of a well liked teenage girl prior to the series start. There are also two hills in San Francisco (the city where Chloe's parents took a photo together when Joyce was expecting Chloe) with the same name. It is a very prominent tourist attraction.
*Also in the parking lot Max spots [Frank Bowers](frank_bowers.md)'s sleeping dog and calls it "{{Wiki|Cujo}}". Cujo is a rabid canine and central character in the same-titled novel written by Stephen King.
*There's a reference to the [w:c:meme:LOL Guy](lol_guy_meme.md) in Chloe's truck.
*When looking at Warren's new car on the parking lot, Max calls it his "{{Wiki|WABAC machine|Wayback Machine}}", a reference to the time machine from the 1960/70s American animated television series *{{Wiki|The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show}}*, which was used to visit and alter famous events in human history.
*Warren suggests Max could've started a {{Wiki|Kickstarter}} fund with a photograph of Victoria covered in paint if the player chooses to comfort Victoria instead of making fun of her.

###  Chloe's Truck 
*On the dashboard of [Chloe's Truck](chloe_s_truck.md) stands a bobble head which appears to be based on the "Wacky Wobbler '68 Special" bobble head of {{Wiki|Elvis Presley}} by the Funko company.

Chloestruck-ep1-puppetsinger.png

###  Chloe's House 
*The graffiti on Chloe’s wall that says “everybody lies no exceptions” is a line from the old animated MTV series *{{Wiki|Daria}},* which is focused on Daria Morgendorffer, a smart, acerbic, and somewhat misanthropic teenage girl who observes the world around her. Chloe is even drawn in a cool little Daria style next to it. 

everybody lies.png
everybody lies_daria.png

[File:Postcard.png](thumb.md)
*One of [Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md)'s postcards to Chloe has "Only stupid people have good relationships"The writing on the postcard is actually misspelled: "Only stupid people have good relashionship". written on it - a reference to the film and graphic novel *{{Wiki|Ghost_World (film)|Ghost World}}*, which is about two cynical best friends and misfits, Enid and Rebecca, who slowly start to drift apart after graduating from high school. There's also a small Enid drawn on the card next to the speech bubble.
*A poster in Chloe's room looks identical to the one used in a promo for the American movie version of *The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo*.

millennium poster chloe's room.png
millenium poster.png

*Another poster in Chloe's room is very clearly a blotchy version of the poster for John Carpenter's 1982 film *The Thing*.

the thing.jpg

*When Max studies a poster of [Arcadia Bay](arcadia_bay.md) in Chloe's house, she quotes American novelist {{Wiki|Thomas Wolfe}}'s book ''You Can't Go Home Again.''
*The cover image on Chloe's blue hair colour dye is identical to an image of a German Youtuber and Blogger called Ira Vampira who is famous for often colouring her hair.

2015-12-13 00023.2.2.png
Ira Vampira Chloe's Hair Colour.jpg

*In the garage of the [Madsen Household](madsen_household.md), the license plate is "TRDTCTV", a reference to *[w:c:truedetective](true_detective.md)*.
*At her house, Chloe compares herself to [w:c:tomb-raider:Lara Croft](lara_croft.md), the protagonist of the *[w:c:tomb-raider](tomb_raider.md)* series. Square Enix published the 2013 reboot of *Tomb Raider*.
*When sitting on the swing in Chloe's garden and contemplating, Max likens herself to a "real" Lara Croft.
*When Chloe shows Max David's gun, she says, "I'm Price... Chloe Price." This is a reference to how [w:c:jamesbond:James Bond](james_bond.md) always introduces himself in the *[w:c:jamesbond](james_bond.md)* series.
*The license plate of the car in [David's Garage](david_s_garage.md) reading "TRDTCTV" can be seen. This is a reference to the American crima drama tv series'''' which premired in 2014.

###  Lighthouse 
*There are a couple of graffiti on a shack near the [lighthouse](lighthouse.md), one of those is of a symbol that represents the characters in a French novel by {{Wiki|Alain Damasio}}, a co-founder of [Don't Nod](don_t_nod.md), named *La Horde du Contrevent* (or *The WindWalkers)*. Wind is a recurring theme in the novel, and upon looking at the graffiti, Max says, "Weird, those [glyphs](glyphs.md) remind me of... the wind."
* Near the lighthouse, Max can approach a boulder with the message "Trust No One" spray-painted on its face. It's a slogan from *{{Wiki|The X-Files}}.*

###  Max's Diary 
* On page 12 of Max's journal, there is a sticker saying "Not all those who wander are lost", which is the second line of a {{Wiki|All that is gold does not glitter|poem}} by {{Wiki|J. R. R. Tolkien}}.

NotAllWanderers-LIS1-sticker.png
maxdiary-page12.png

* On page 22 is a sticker graphic that says, "Three Meters Above The Sky", which appears to reference the 2004 Italian film inspired by the novel *Tre metri sopra il cielo* by Federico Moccia (literally "Three meters above the sky"). The film is summarized as "A romantic drama for teenagers that tells the story of two youngsters belonging to opposite worlds. It's the chronicle of an improbable relationship that is practically impossible but just as inevitable. It will end up dragging the couple along for a voyage of discovery on which they will experience true love together for the first time. She is a well-to-do girl. He is a rebellious boy, addicted to risk and danger*."*Plot summary of 'Three Meters Above the Sky": https://www.globomedia.es/en/cinema/3-meters-above-sky [http://variety.com/2010/film/reviews/three-steps-above-heaven-1117944186/ Variety magazine] writes: "Slowly, he becomes more tender, [the girl] more rebellious." The descriptions of these two characters appear to match the characters of Max and Chloe rather well.

##  Episode Two - "[Episode 2: Out of Time](out_of_time.md)" 
###  Prescott Dormitory 
* While studying quantum physics and time travel, Max makes several references to well-known time travel theories including {{Wiki|Schrödinger's Cat}}, {{Wiki|Stephen Hawking}}'s {{Wiki|Time_travel#Tourism_in_time|Tourism in Time}} and the {{Wiki|Quantum entanglement|Quantum Entanglement}}.
* [File:Max_room_paradox_book.png](right.md) The "Theory, Paradoxes & Possibilities" book seen on the floor of Max's room in this episode could perhaps be based on a 2013 [https://www.space.com/21675-time-travel.html online article] about time travel, which is titled, "Time Travel: Theories, Paradoxes & Possibilities". (The two white lines that sit above the "Theory, Paradoxes & Possibilities" title on Max's book could be an artistic representation of the two words, "time travel", as text is commonly represented on the game textures by way of bars and squiggles.)
* On Max's request, Warren listed some time travel films in an email including *{{Wiki|The Time Machine (1960 film)|The Time Machine (1960)}}*, *{{Wiki|Primer (film)|Primer}}*, *{{Wiki|Time After Time (1979_film)|Time After Time}}*, *{{Wiki|Pulp Fiction}}*, *{{Wiki|Somewhere in Time (film)|Somewhere in Time}}*, *{{Wiki|G.I. Samurai|Time Slip/G.I. Samurai}}*, *{{Wiki|Timecop}}.*
* On Max's table, there is a book called "The Moron’s Guide to Time Travel” by Nick Meyer. The author's name “Nick Meyer” is a reference to {{Wiki|Nicholas Meyer}}, the director of the 1979 time travel film *Time After Time*.
* Warren's email account icon is a picture of the {{Wiki|TARDIS}}, the time machine in the British time travel series *{{Wiki|Doctor Who}}*. He also refers to himself as "The Doctor", the protagonist of the series, in his email and text messages.
* Warren mentions *{{Wiki|Back to the Future}}* in his email to Max. After her request regarding information on relativity, wormholes and time travel, he texts Max if he's now Doctor Who or {{Wiki|Emmett_Brown|Doc Brown}} and that "he'll be in the TARDIS getting his {{Wiki|DeLorean time machine|DeLorean}} ready", again referring to *Doctor Who* and *Back to the Future*.
* In her Halloween party invitation email, Dana refers to herself as "Dana of the Dead", in reference to the zombie horror movie *{{Wiki|Dawn of the Dead (2004_film)|Dawn of the Dead}}*.
* When Max waters Lisa the Plant, she says, “Drink up… it’s got electrolytes”. The quote is a reference to the film *{{Wiki|Idiocracy}}*.
*There's a pack of Mystic Enchantment cards in Max's drawer; a reference to the popular trading card game {{Wiki|Magic: The Gathering|Magic}}.
*When looking at her guitar, Max says, "Meanwhile, my guitar gently sleeps", which is a reference to the Beatles song *While My Guitar Gently Weeps*.
* After warning [Alyssa Anderson](alyssa_anderson.md) about the toilet paper in the hall of the girls’ dormitory, she asks Max what her favorite science-fiction film is. The player has the choice of choosing between *Back to the Future*, *{{Wiki|Looper (film)|Looper}}* and *{{Wiki|Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day}}* when answering Alyssa.
* Kate's book, *The October Country* by Ray Bradbury, comprises 19 short stories that often deal with macabre themes, celebrity pressures and end in death, paralleling Kate Marsh's situation with the viral video and her suicide.
*Max suggests that Kate is in her {{Wiki|H.R. Giger}} period upon seeing Kate's recent dark-themed drawings.
* If the player chose to make fun of Victoria, Max's room will be trashed and vandalized. On the ground, nearest to her radio, is a ruined copy of *{{Wiki|Donnie Darko}}*.

###  Dormitory Grounds 
* When attempting to get the second photograph achievement, "Full Exposure", Max likens the squirrel she lures out of into the open with a doughnut to the Kraken. The {{Wiki|Kraken}} is a mythological creature of Scandinavian origin, recently popularized by the 2006 and 2010 films ''{{Wiki|Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest}}* and the remake of the *{{Wiki|Clash of the Titans (2010 film)|Clash of the Titans}}''. By shouting "Release the kraken!" she makes reference to the popular meme.
* Warren's t-shirt in this episode contains a cartoon drawing of a box and a "meow!" bubble speech imposed above it, a reference to the Schrödinger's cat theory. He later texts Max and declares "he's no Schrödinger's kitty".
* Warren mentions that the drive-in at Newport is showing a *{{Wiki|Planet of the Apes}}* film marathon.
* When Max declines Warren's invitation to the drive-in, he makes a joke about her being a "damn dirty human", in reference to the quote "damn dirty ape" from *Planet of the Apes*.

###  Blackwell Academy Bus 
[File:Orca.jpg](thumb.md)
While Max is riding the bus, two boats can be seen on the left side of the main road. One of these boats is named "The Orca", which is likely a reference to the boat of the same name in the movie Jaws (which is theme alluded later in the game).

###  Two Whales Diner 
* In the parking lot of the [Two Whales Diner](two_whales_diner.md), there are references to several television series and films on the license plates:

Licence_Plate_Reference_(EP2)-02.jpg|#1 "NTHRRTH" - *{{Wiki|Another Earth}}*
Licence_Plate_Reference_(EP2)-03.jpg|#2 "DNNDRK" - *{{Wiki|Donnie Darko}}*

* At Blackwell Academy, Max is given two nicknames. [Evan Harris](evan_harris.md) refers to Max as "Maxwell Smart" before telling they'll speak later. Maxwell Smart was a character in the 1965-1970s sitcom *{{Wiki|Get Smart}}* that ran on NBC and later CBS. Warren calls Max "Maxwell Silver Hammer" in the science class. "Maxwell's Silver Hammer" is the name of a single performed by {{Wiki|The Beatles}}.

##  Episode Three - "[Episode 3: Chaos Theory](chaos_theory.md)" 
###  Prescott Dormitory 
* Some people on the Missing Persons list on Max's laptop are references to famous authors:
** There is an entry for "Winston Smith" who went missing in 1984. This is a reference to George Orwell's *1984*, where Winston Smith is the main character. At the end of this novel, he also is presumed to go missing. The missing since date is the same as the date the novel was published, July 8.
** There is an entry for "Elton Kesey" who went missing on November 10, 2001. This is a reference to Kenneth Elton "Ken" Kesey, an American author, best known for his novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. The missing since date is the same as the date the author died.
* When turning on her flashlight, Max says "Let there be...", which is a reference to the creation story in the first book of the Bible.
*In the hall, Max can look to a Vortex Club "End of the World Party" poster she will remark; "I'll bet they will party like it's 1999. Assholes." This may be a reference to the famous song by {{Wiki|Prince (musician)|Prince}}, 1999 (Party like it's 1999).
* Max's Facebook header, "Time is Bunk", is a quote from {{Wiki|Douglas Adams}}'s novel, ''{{Wiki|The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy|The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy}}''.
* If Kate Marsh died, Max uses a quote from Jack Kerouac's, *The Dharma Bums*: "Are we fallen angels who didn't want to believe that nothing is nothing..." If Kate Marsh survived, Max uses the first stanza of {{Wiki|William Blake}}'s *The Tyger* from *Songs of Innocence and Experience: *"Tyger Tyger, burning bright / In the forests of the night; / What immortal hand or eye, / Could frame thy fearful symmetry?"
* If Kate Marsh died, Victoria will leave the quote, "Requiescat in pace" as a message on Kate's Facebook profile. "Requiesact in pace", literally meaning "May he or she rest in peace", is a phrase popularized by {{Wiki|Ezio Auditore da Firenze}} of Ubisoft Montreal's ''{{Wiki|Assassin's Creed}}'' series, specifically in Assassin's Creed II, Brotherhood and Revelations.
* If David Madsen was suspended, a Facebook page calling for David to be fired features a Doge meme dressed in a security uniform.

* When referring to little known facts about Victoria, Max begins her sentences with "Victoria's secret?" Victoria's Secret is major American retail store that was established in 1977 by Roy Raymond.
* Victoria's room contains a glow in the dark [Media:Note3-vicroom-doll.png](figurine.md) that is also an optional photo. Its packaging is located in her trash can and contains a hidden reference that is only revealed through an understanding of English and Chinese. On the front, the only completely legibleThere is a completely illegible word in Japanese hiragana at the top of the packaging. The partially illegible Japanese katakana at the bottom of the packaging, ヌー(?)コス [nu-- (?)ko-su], could mean "new (?) costume", as コス is "costume". This would make sense on the packaging of a figurine. words are: *My*, *Bluberry*, and 之夜之 is an old Japanese kanji possessive particle that the hiragana particle の now replaces in this modern day. But 之 is still used as a possessive article in Chinese. It acts as both "apostrophe s" and "of" in English. 夜 is the Chinese character that means "night". This translates to ''My Bluberry('s) Night* and is believed to be a reference to the film *{{wiki|My Blueberry Nights}}'' - a product of France and China. Perhaps a member of Dontnod's team is a fan of this film.

###  Blackwell at Night 
* When talking to Chloe about Chaos Theory, Max says "I don't see any control over this chaos", another reference to the film *Get Smart*.
* During Chloe's attempt to break into Principal Wells's office, she refers to Max as "Lupin". The character {{Wiki|Ars%C3%A8ne_Lupin|Arsène Lupin III}} of the anime *Lupin III* is famous and notorious thief created by noted manga artist Kazuhiko Katō.
* During her phone call with Warren, Max advises him to "Bubble Hearth", a *{{Wiki|World of Warcraft}} *term that refers to the combination of Divine Shield and Hearthstone which allowed Paladins to transport to escape PVP or general combat. Max also texts him back with "kek" in Episode 1, meaning "Lol" in Orcish.
* The James Bond references return when Warren calls Max "007" in his instructions on how to make the pipe bomb.
* In the Principal's secretary office, Max spots a red cap which she comments with, "Only a total phony would wear a crappy hat like that." This is another reference to Haulden Caulfield from *Catcher in the Rye, *who wears the same kind of hat and calls others "phoney".
* If you rewind time after using the vending machine and use it again while searching through Blackwell at night, Max will make a comment about how she could get every can in the machine with just one coin, with a little {{Wiki|Star Wars}} pun shortly after; "But don't go to the darkside, young Max."
* In the science lab, there is an optional photo opportunity at the skeleton with a cigarette, which may be a tribute to the work *{{Wiki|Skull of a Skeleton with Burning Cigarette}}* by Vincent van Gogh.
* In the science lab, Max uses a variation of {{Wiki|Leonard McCoy}}'s "I'm a doctor, not a..." catchphrase in *{{Wiki|Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series|Star Trek}}* when searching for weed killer.
* When Max buys a drink at the vending machine at school, she says, "Release the kra-can!", in reference to the "[http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/release-the-kraken Release The Kraken!]" meme.
* In Principal Wells's office, when taking the fifth optional photograph for this episode, Max and Chloe quote {{Wiki|Tony Montana}} of *{{Wiki|Scarface_(1983_film)|Scarface}}*: "Say hello to my little friend!" - "Say goodnight to the bad guy!"

* After finding selfies of Victoria in her dressing room locker, Max says, "So Victoria's secret is... selfies", a joke again referencing to America's largest lingerie retailer, ''{{Wiki|Victoria's Secret}}*.
*One of the locker room graffiti tags reads "Rachel Abides", which might be a reference to 1998 film *The Big Lebowski*.
* In the boys bathroom the message "Dana needs a baby daddy" features a Me Gusta meme face.
* In the boys locker room a jacket can be found, which closely resembles the one the protagonist of the 2012 video game *Hotline Miami* wears.
*When Max dive-bombs into the swimming pool, she yells "Cowabunga!", a reference to the cartoon series *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles*.
* In the [Blackwell Swimming Pool](blackwell_pool.md), Chloe and Max make several references to the 1975 shark attack thriller *Jaws'', directed by {{Wiki|Steven Spielberg}}.
**If Max examines a toy shark on the side of the pool, she'll state "Just when I thought it was safe to go back in the water...", a reference to *Jaws 2*.
**When both Max and Chloe are in the pool, Chloe will tease Max by humming the shark's leitmotif. Max gets upset, claiming to still be terrified by the movie.

###  Chloe's House 
* In the Arcadia Bay Police Department's website for missing persons on Chloe's computer, there are two major novel references. One of the persons listed missing in Arcadia Bay is a man named Elton Kesey. {{Wiki|Ken Kesey}} is an American novelist best known for his 1962 novel ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest''. Another, Winston Smith, was listed missing since "6/08/1984". George Orwell's novel, *Nineteen Eighty-Four*, was published June 8, 1949.
*According to David's file on her, Max uses the online aliases Mad Max, Max Factor, and Noir Angel.
*On Chloe's desk, Max can see a book "Mystic weather — supernatural sciences" by Doctor J. Karswell. It is likely a reference to the character Dr. Julian Karswell in the 1957 British horror movie *Night of the Demon.* The movie sets up a familiar "man of reason forced to acknowledge existence of the supernatural" story. Furthermore, the movie was directed by Jacques Tourneur, a French director.

###  Two Whales Diner 
*Outside the dinner, near the fisherman [Media:Weeter.jpg](a_sign.md) can be seen on which "follow us on Weeter" is written. Weeter could be a reference to the social media platform {{Wiki|Twitter}}.
*If you look at the News Interview on the TV at the Two Whales Diner, the doctor's name is "Doctor Hedorah", a possible reference to the Smog Monster from the 11th *Godzilla* series movie, *Godzilla vs Hedorah*.
*The cool-looking 18 wheeler truck in front of the diner is called a Needham 1977. This is a reference to *Smokey and the Bandit*, a 1977 film that was directed by Hal Needham, an actor, writer, director, and stunt man. The film itself featured quite a bit of trucker/CB culture.
*After Max steals the RV keys from Frank and meets up with Chloe, she calls her "The Amazing SpiderMax". A reference to one of the comic book and film titles of {{Wiki|Spider-Man}}, *{{Wiki|The Amazing Spider-Man}}*.

###  Garibaldi Picture 
When Max goes back in time to the year 2008, there is a picture on the refrigerator of a sailing boat with the word "Garibaldi" beneath it. It appears that this may be based on the title image of the [http://visitgaribaldi.com/ "Visit Garibaldi"] tourism website. (It is also present on the refrigerator in the 2013 alternative timeline.) Garibaldi, in turn, is one of the towns that inspired the town of Arcadia Bay.

Pris, however, never dyed the ends of her bangs.
*Alternative Chloe asks Max whether or not she believed {{Wiki|Rick Deckard|Deckard}} was a {{Wiki|Replicant}}. The question is part of a longstanding discussion that began following the release of the film in 1982. The "Final Cut" learns heavily toward the argument supporting the Deckard-Replicant angle. {{Wiki|Ridley Scott}} has stated multiple times that Deckard was, in fact, a Replicant from the beginning.
*Alternative Chloe refers to her morphine injector as "total {{Wiki|Star Trek}} shit", referencing the series' fictional {{Wiki|Hypospray|hypospray}}, an injector which doesn't use a needle.
*Alternative Chloe tells Max, "Hope you’re not jealous of all my tech toys...", to which Max responds with, "I'm blown away, Tony Stark...", which is a reference to Tony Stark a.k.a. {{wiki|Iron Man}} from Marvel comics who is a wealthy businessman and scientist/inventor.
*In her diary, Max mentions Vangelis, the composer of the much known Blade Runner soundtrack.
*When Max returns from the bathroom with the morphine, Chloe says, "Finally. Give me the blue pill…".

*Warren's room slate says, "There is no unique picture of reality - {{Wiki|Stephen Hawking}}".

The backgrounds are highly reminiscent of *{{Wiki|The_Cabinet_of_Dr._Caligari|The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari}}*. It tells the story of an insane hypnotist who uses a somnambulist to commit murders. This can be seen as an allegory for Nathan's entanglement in Jefferson's Dark Room deeds as a manipulated victim out of their own control.
*After beating up Nathan in the Prescott Dormitory, Warren offers to stick with Chloe and Max, just in case they need him "to get [his] Hulk on again", referring to the Marvel character and superhero Bruce Banner who turns into {{Wiki|Hulk (comics)#Bruce Banner|Hulk}}, a large green humanoid that possesses superhuman strength and invulnerability when he is angered.

###  [Beach](beach.md) 
* Frank calls Max and Chloe the "Wonder Twins" and the "Hardy Boys".

*When looking at an old photo of the barn, Max says, "Talk about home on the range," which is a reference to the 2004 animation film *Home on the Range*.
*When Max notices a hook used to lift haystacks, she mentions seeing them in one of the *{{Wiki|Friday the 13th}}* films.
*When Max approaches the owl in the barn, she calls it "Doctor Hoo", which is another reference to the British time travel series *Doctor Who*. It's often remarked by fans that {{Wiki|Peter Capaldi}}, who currently portrays the Doctor, looks like an owl.

*After taking a selfie with a drunk Warren outside the party, he apologizes and justifies his actions by saying, "Sorry... I just wanted to feel like a normal student after this week's ultraviolence." {{Wiki|Ultraviolence}} is a term coined by Anthony Burgess in his novel *{{Wiki|A Clockwork Orange}}*.
*At the [End of the World Party](end_of_the_world_party.md), when talking with [Brooke Scott](brooke_scott.md) about superpowers, Max says, "With great power comes great bullshit", which is a reference to {{Wiki|Spider-Man}}'s uncle's famous line, "With great power there must also come great responsibility".
*If Max convinced Daniel to attend the Vortex Club party, both him and Brooke mention going to see a "Miyazaki" exhibit, presumably {{Wiki|Hayao Miyazaki}} of {{Wiki|Studio Ghibli}}.
*After failing to convince [Sarah](sarah.md) to let her in the VIP section, Max goes to [Courtney Wagner](courtney_wagner.md) for help and tells her that "Zuul the Gatekeeper won't let her pass". Zuul is a character from the film *{{Wiki|Ghostbusters}}*.
*Max makes a reference to the film *{{Wiki|Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie}}* when she reads the graffiti on a wall that says "Fuck your selfie" in the Vortex Club Party VIP section. The protagonist of this film goes berserk on a party held by her popular school mates and kills everyone.
*During Max's conversation with Alyssa about Kate, Alyssa says "{{Wiki|So it goes}}", which is a line repeated in Kurt Vonnegut's novel *{{Wiki|Slaughterhouse Five}}*.
*If Max talks to Justin at the Vortex Club party he'll refer to Max as "Maximum Overdrive", a reference to the same-titled Stephen King film.
*Looking at a drunk guy in the toilets, Max comments "Goodnight, sweet prince", which is another reference to *Hamlet*.
*The game Brooke is playing on her phone is likely a reference to *{{Wiki|Candy Crush Saga}}*. This is further supported by the texture's name, *CadyCrash*.

##  Episode Five - "[Episode 5: Polarized](polarized.md)" 

###  Plane 
* The redhead man sitting in front of Max (who is probably a reference to [Michel Koch](michel_koch.md)) is seen playing a video game which looks a lot like {{Wiki|Candy Crush}}, the most famous match-3 game at the moment. The game files reveal that the game is actually called "CadyCrash", making the reference even more obvious.

###  Zeitgeist Gallery 
* A series of sculptures in the San Francisco [Zeitgeist Gallery](zeitgeist_gallery.md) seem to depict {{Wiki|John Cleese}}'s signature *{{Wiki|Ministry of Silly Walks}}* walk. When Max looks at the one on the left she says, "That one looks kinda silly." These sculptures are also highly reminiscent of those of expressionist A. Giacometti. In the game files, the model of the sculpture is named "SillyGiaco" which is hinting at both of these references.
* One of the art exhibits at the Zeitgeist Gallery is a picture of a person's cybernetic arm similar to Adam Jensen's, the protagonist of *{{Wiki|Deus Ex: Human Revolution}}*.
* One of Max's thoughts while at the Zeitgeist Gallery is: *"How much would I charge if somebody wanted to buy my picture... Whoa, slow down, Max Warhol."* Here Max compares herself to {{Wiki|Andy Warhol}}.
* The "This is water" graffiti that is visible outside the gallery might be reference to the homonymous {{Wiki|This Is Water|commencement speech}} by {{Wiki|David Foster Wallace}}.
* In the gallery's lobby, Max can see a pamphlet for a lecture about dystopias, with examples like *Metropolis*, *Planet of the Apes*, *Blade Runner*, and *The Hunger Games*.
* Max also sees a newspaper article about a person called "[Daniel Lee](danny_lee.md)". This name could refer to a New Zealand golfer who often takes selfies. In one article he is even referred to as the "No. 1 golfer in the world /when it comes to selfies)".Said Danny Lee article: http://www.golfdigest.com/story/danny-lee-is-the-no-1-golfer-in-the-world-when-it-comes-to-taking-selfies Max can meet a journalist with the same name at the gallery.
* The journalist Danny Lee states that he is currently editing the art section of the "Berkeley People's Herald". His phrase about the "Berkeley People's Herald" might be a reference to the film *{{Wiki|Big Trouble in Little China}}*. (See [http://www.subzin.com/quotes/M973191e3/Big+Trouble+in+Little+China/I%27m+Margo+Litzenberger.+I%27m+with+the+Berkeley+People%27s+Herald. here] for the quote).
* Many of the "Everyday Heroes Contest" winners share surnames with famous sci-fi writers, such as: Atwood, Ballard, Chabon, Cline, Eggers, Levin, McCarthy, Pynchon, and Vonnegut
* The guestbook at the Zeitgeist Gallery has an entry written by someone named "Lisa Simpsons", a possible reference to the TV series *{{Wiki|The Simpsons}}* considering Lisa being known for her interest in art and science.

###  Dark Room 
*When Max is tied to the chair in the [Dark Room (Location)](dark_room.md) and asked for help by saying, "Is there anybody out there?", it might be a reference to the song of Pink Floyd on the album "The Wall" from 1979 which has the same title.
*Max's "focus within a focus" on the selfie she took in class is a direct reference to the "remixing the remix" segment of *Remember Me*.
*Halfway through the episode, Max wakes up in a timeline where she's back in the Dark Room and cannot escape using her powers because Jefferson burned her diary and photos. This could be a reference to the climax of *The Butterfly Effect*, where the protagonist wakes up in a timeline where he's in a mental institution and cannot escape because in this timeline his diaries (his medium for time travel) don't exist.
*When Max takes out her phone to call Warren and ask him for the photo, you can see that the carrier on Max's phone in "Vaireezon", which might be a reference to *{{Wiki|Verizon Wireless|Verizon}}*.

###  Two Whales Diner 
*Driving to the diner, Max hears a radio host talking how a society of sin and entitlements is responsible for God's wrath. His name, Truss Limpbow, is a reference to American talk show host {{Wiki|Rush Limbaugh}}.
*When talking at the Two Whales diner, Warren tells Max "I'm not a real scientist, even though I play one at school", referencing a phrase that originated from an 80s cough syrup commercial featuring an actor from *General Hospital*.

###  Nightmare 
*In [Max's Nightmare](max_s_nightmare.md), when sneaking behind Frank Bowers with a flashlight, he says, "Me and Rachel are floating down here in the sewer... Come on down!", which is a reference to Stephen King's *IT*.
*While hiding from Warren in the maze he says, "Max... Where are you? Max, come out to play... Come out to play!" This is a reference to the 1979 movie *{{Wiki|The_Warriors_(film)|The Warriors}}*, where Luther, leader of a rival gang, says this famous line to the Warriors--"Warriors, come out to play!"
*When trapped for too long in the maze, Max can make an inner comment about Freddy Krueger, a character of the "A Nightmare on Elm Street" film series.{{Headphones|file# ‎VO_E5_7B.STM_208~Act_E5_7B_ArtClass_NightmareLines_Scripted_Max_060.ogg}} Freddy is a demon attacking his victims in their dreams, causing their deaths in the real world as well — which is fitting Max's situation.
*A sequence in the finale involves walking down the same seemingly identical hallway time after time, making small interactions along the way, which closely resembles a sequence from the *Silent Hill* video game.
*The edges of walkways in the labyrinthine segments of Max's nightmare echo the edges of walkways in the Ego Rooms in *Remember Me*.
*One of the lines scribbled in Max's journal during the nightmare sequence reads, "The doe is a lie," which is repeated three times in capitals across the top of the left-hand page. This is a deliberate nod to the popularized line, "The Cake Is a Lie," from the video game {{wiki|Portal (video game)|Portal}},Confirmed by [Alysianne Bui](alysianne_bui.md) who was one of the two artists that worked on the journal. in which a cake is used as a fictitious motivator for the player to perform tasks. "The Cake Is a Lie" reference spread outside gaming forums to become an idiom meaning, "You are chasing after an empty, unattainable goal."See [http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-cake-is-a-lie this page] for more about "The Cake Is a Lie."
*The design of the nightmare version of the Diner's bathroom is a possible reference to the *SAW* movies.

###  Sacrifice Arcadia Bay Ending 
*The Chloe Ending contains a possible reference to *Fight Club* with the two holding hands as they witness wanton destruction the protagonist was (inadvertently) the catalyst of as music plays.
*The final shot of the sacrifice Arcadia Bay ending where Max and Chloe drive off the town very closely resembles an [https://www.youtube.com/watch?vxEGGQ958K_s intro] shot of the series *Twin Peaks*.

twin peaks town.2.jpg
sac arcadia bay ending twin peaks reference.jpg

###  Sacrifice Chloe Ending 
*The Arcadia Bay ending is a reference to *Donnie Darko*, with Chloe sacrificing herself via time travel and by correcting the original timeline to save the city from destruction.

##  References to Life is Strange 

###  Stranger Things 
* Upon the release of Season 2 in 2017, fans noticed a few possible references to *Life is Strange*:
** One character, [w:c:strangerthings:Max_Mayfield](maxine_mayfield.md), shares many similarities with Maxine Caulfield.
*** Although her real name is Maxine, she only goes by Max.
**** When her teacher calls her Maxine, she replies, "Nobody calls me Maxine. It's Max." DONTNOD also pointed out the familiarity of the dialogue in a [https://www.facebook.com/DONTNOD.Entertainment/photos/a.217818101602794/1629779137073343/?type# 3&theater social media post.]
*** Her last name ends in "-field".
*** Her nickname is "MADMAX”.
*** She is from the west coast.
** In the episode "The Lost Sister", [w:c:strangerthings:Kali_Prasad](kali_prasad.md) conjures a blue butterfly that looks extremely similar to the one present within the game.
**The character Jim Hopper may be based on that of David Madsen, as both share certain similarities:
***Just as David Madsen married Joyce Price, a single mother, Jim Hopper has an ongoing chemistry with the character Joyce Byers, who is also a single mother.
***Both are in positions of security-based authority: Jim Hopper is the Chief of Police for the town of Hawkins, Indiana, while David is Chief of Security for Blackwell Academy.
***There is also a striking physical resemblance between the two, the most noteworthy feature being a prominent mustache.

##  Notes 

* also takes place in the Pacific Northwest and is centered around the mysterious disappearance of Laura Palmer, a well-liked teenage girl, which mirrors [Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md), prior to the series start.
* Both *Life is Strange* and *Twin Peaks* work with the "quiet town with secrets" trope.
* The "[Dark Room (Location)](dark_room.md)" where Rachel was taken and the curtains separating the storage room from the actual studio as well as the red curtains Max crosses when entering the Vortex Club party are references to the Black Lodge from *Twin Peaks*.
* The implication that Jefferson is shifting his attention to [Victoria Chase](victoria_chase.md), who wins the [Everyday Heroes Photo Contest](everyday_heroes_photo_contest.md), is similar to how the *Twin Peaks'' villain kidnapped the winner of the Miss Twin Peaks pageant, which is in any case, a parallel to the Everyday Heroes Photo Contest.
* In the Dark Room, a letter to Sean Prescott addressing Nathan's mental health is signed by a [Dr. Jacoby](dr__jacoby.md), which is the name of a psychiatrist in *Twin Peaks*.
* Mark Jefferson states that his orchestration of the Dark Room crimes stems from an obsession to capture the loss of innocence and youth. BOB and the other spirits of the Black Lodge in *Twin Peaks* feed on 'garmonbozia', a physical representation of pain and suffering, which they must torment people to create.
* The Double R Diner could be the inspiration for the Two Whales Diner.
* In the bathroom in the [Two Whales Diner](two_whales_diner.md), "fire walk with me" is written, a reference to the movie *Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me*, the prequel to the original series.
* The [Diner Cop](police_officer.md) is similar to the character Dale Cooper from the series, who also very consistently praised pies from the local café. In the game, the officer praises [Joyce Price](joyce_price.md)'s pumpkin pies at the Two Whales Diner.
* [File:Deputy Andy Brennan Twin Peaks - Officer Anderson Berry.jpg](thumb.md) [Anderson Berry](officer_anderson_berry.md) appears to be modeled after deputy [w:c:twinpeaks:Andy Brennan](andy_nbsp_brennan.md) from *Twin Peaks*. Apart from general similar looks, they share the same first name (Anderson, shortened to Andy) and even the prominent mole on the exact same spot, on the right, slightly above the mouth.
* The white horse in *Twin Peaks* which is featured in scenes with Laura Palmer is a mirror of the doe that appears in reference to Rachel Amber.
* Chloe's car license plate is TWNPKS (Twin Peaks).
* Laura Palmer and Rachel Amber share the same birthday, July 22nd.
* If Max tells David about Chloe's murder in Episode 5, he shoots and kills Jefferson. Twin Peaks has a similar situation with Leland Palmer smothering Jacques Renault, whom he thought responsible for his daughter's murder.
* In the [Max's Nightmare](nightmare_sequence.md) before the final decision, there are three very Black Lodge-esque moments: The presence of Doppelgängers of Max's friends and acquaintances which torture her psychologically, a throwback to the academy hallway at the start of Episode 1 where all the dialogue and hover text is backwards, and a seemingly endless cycle when Max goes through the doors of her dorm's corridor only to find she is back in the same place she started from (unless she manages to go through the right doors). Regarding the latter, this seemingly endless cycle happened with Agent Cooper when he walked through the curtains from waiting room to waiting room (a.k.a. the red room). Each room looked the same, but sometimes little things changed or appeared.
* [Samuel Taylor](samuel_taylor.md)'s character may be an analog to the character of the Log Lady in *{{wiki|Twin Peaks}}* - a TV show that [Michel Koch](michel_koch.md) says is his top favorite.[https://youtu.be/7DGgxSbRWio?t840 Gamespot interview E3 2015]. Similarly to the Log Lady, Samuel is seen as a strange, creepy or quirky character and has a seemingly supernatural connection to the town with an uncanny insight into its mysteries.
* Rachel Amber was secretly seeing a male (Jefferson). In Twin Peaks, inside Laura Palmer's nonsecret diary (the one the police first obtain), she wrote, "Nervous about meeting J tonight." A plastic letter "J" was also found in Laura’s stomach during forensic examination.
* Rachel Amber was thought of as a model student, with hardly anyone knowing she was involved with drugs or even a drug dealer. However, there were a few who knew about her wilder side or at least heard rumors. Nathan Prescott (who was known to run drugs in the school to other students) said Rachel "partied like a fiend on her own." In Twin Peaks, inside Laura Palmer's nonsecret diary was an envelope containing traces of cocaine. This surprised the local Sheriff who did not think of her as a drug user. One of the men she was seeing, Leo Johnson, describes her as a "wild girl." Even Laura's psychiatrist, Dr. Jacoby, stated "she was living a double life." Another older man states that Laura always got her way, yet many people in town thought she was perfect.
* Rachel's suspicious behavior was reported by Blackwell's head of security, and she was found with pharmaceuticals on campus. In Twin Peaks, drugs were being sold at the school, and it is believed Laura Palmer was one of the students being given drugs there.
* Rachel Amber was keeping things from even her closest female friend, Chloe Price. In the *Fire Walk With Me* movie, Laura Palmer says to James Hurley, a boy she has been seeing: "You don't even know me. There are things about me... Even Donna doesn’t know me." (Donna being her best friend).
* According to a crumpled-up letter found in the junkyard, Rachel wrote that she is obsessed with a guy who is "wise and unconventional" and "kind of scary, not in a 'bad boy' way." This turns out to be Mr. Jefferson, who is a mature male in a position of authority who should know better than to get involved with a student. In Twin Peaks, Laura Palmer teases and confides her dark secrets to her psychiatrist, Dr. Jacoby - another mature man in a position of authority who should know better than to get intimately involved with a patient.
* The video footage of Laura Palmer dancing with her best friend, taken by somebody else, is similar to the photo of Rachel and Chloe who appear to be dancing, also taken by somebody else.
* Rachel Amber wears a Native-American-inspired turquoise feather earring in one ear only. In Twin Peaks, a Native-American police deputy wears a turquoise earring in one ear only and the same ear throughout the majority of Seasons 1 and 2.
* Sean Prescott and his development plans for Arcadia Bay may have been inspired by the head of the Horne family who is a rich property developer in town, who schemes to take over the local saw mill to knock it down for redevelopment. The saw mill is an important source of economy to the Twin Peaks town folk, just like how the fishing industry is important to Arcadia Bay yet has been threatened by Prescott activity in the area.
* Frank was rumored to have taken a blood oath with Rachel. Two characters in Twin Peaks of the opposite sex also took a blood oath.
* Jefferson is wearing white surgical gloves when he drugs Max. The main villain and killer of Laura Palmer puts on white surgical gloves upon drugging his wife.
* Max meets what could be her shadow self in the diner during her nightmare - a doppelgänger. She has to stand up to this "shadow self" who attempts to make her see a darker, selfish side to herself. In Twin Peaks, the Native-American police deputy describes the Black Lodge as a place where every spirit must pass through on a way to perfection. It is there that you meet your shadow self: "The Dweller on the Threshold." The deputy goes on to say that "if you confront the Black Lodge with imperfect courage, it will utterly annihilate your soul."
* When Max meets her doppelgänger in the diner of her nightmare, it raises the question as to whether the doppelgänger knows the real truth behind her nature or whether it is trying to send a darker, more selfish version of Max back to the real world. In Twin Peaks, Agent Cooper finds he has a doppelgänger in the waiting room (red room). He becomes possessed by this evil entity, and his good soul is trapped while his bad double goes back to reality.
* There is a fan theory that Max is trapped in purgatory and that the point where she wakes up in the forest at the start of the game is an endless cycle. This is also the area where she later has to make a choice between two paths. In Twin Peaks, Major Briggs states that "fear and love open the doors" to the two different lodges: fear for the Black Lodge, and love for the White Lodge. The forest in Twin Peaks is where the two worlds meet.
* Deer feature prominently in Life is Strange as a spirit animal. In the world of Twin Peaks, it is said that "gentle fawns gamboled [in the White Lodge] amidst happy, laughing spirits."
* There is a truck driver in Life is Strange who refers to Rachel Amber as a gold digger, which suggests she may have tried to use him in exchange for something she wants (whether this is likely to be a ride to L.A. or something else). In Twin Peaks, it is revealed that Laura Palmer gives sex to a truck driver in exchange for cocaine.
* Chloe Price described Rachel as her angel. Angels appear in *Fire Walk With Me* both in the form of a painting and people. In *The Missing Pieces* (a movie-length collection of missing scenes from *Fire Walk With Me*), a scene with Doc Hayward shows him reading a secret message for Laura: "The angels will return, and when you see the one that is meant to help you, you will weep with joy."

###  The Butterfly Effect 
* The protagonists of *The Butterfly Effect* trilogy all have the ability to visit and alter their past through devices like photographs (or diaries, films) and so create different timelines/realities like Max who can use photographs.
* The protagonist of *{{Wiki|The Butterfly Effect}}*, the first movie of the trilogy, Evan, suffers from headaches, unconsciousness and nosebleeds caused by overusing his ability like Max (though the reason here differs from simply overusing; Evan's brain has to deal with additional memories from all the alternative timelines he creates, whereas Max's brain seems just to be over-challenged by rewinding too much or the attempt of rewinding too far).
* Just like Max, Evan moved away from his hometown when he was 13 leaving his childhood friend behind. They fell out of touch and when he meets her again years later, he has to realize how messed up her life has become since he disappeared from her life. When she, shortly after seeing each other for the first time after all these years, dies, Evan uses his power to prevent her death and tries to change her past for the better.
* Evan changes a major event in his and his childhood friend's past and so creates a new timeline inadvertently resulting in someone ending up permanently in a wheelchair, exactly like in the [Alternative Timeline (Life is Strange)](alternative_timeline.md) Max creates at the end of Episode 3 (though, here it is the protagonist himself that ends up in a wheelchair).
* Evan creates another timeline where his alter ego appears to be the opposite of his personality, member of a popular and elitist social group and friends with people he never would've befriended, which is another aspect of the alternate timeline created by Max in which she is a member of the popular Vortex Club and friends with Nathan and Victoria.
* Halfway through Episode 5, Max wakes up in a timeline where she's back in the Dark Room and cannot escape using her powers because Jefferson burned her diary and photos. Similarly, in the climax of the film, Evan wakes up in a timeline where he's in a mental institution and cannot escape because in this timeline his diaries (his medium for time travel) don't exist.
* At the end of the story Evan has to let go of the person he desperately tried to save throughout the whole story to create a morally acceptable timeline, which resembles the Sacrifice Chloe ending.
* Every time Evan and Max change something in the past, there is a [Timestream](photo_montage.md) of old and new memories that replace each other in the new timeline.
* The Dark Room mirrors the basement of the protagonist's childhood friend's father who wanted to take illicit videos of his daughter and Evan when they were younger. The cuts and transitions that occur when Evan regains consciousness after his blackouts or when going back to this scene resemble the ones that occur in *Life is Strange* when Max is waking up/regaining consciousness in the Dark Room scenes with Jefferson wanting to take pictures of her.

###  Donnie Darko 
* Both *Life is Strange* and *{{Wiki|Donnie Darko}}* shares the approach of {{Wiki|Parallel Universes|Tangent Universes}} and the general idea of time travel.
* A common central theme of *{{Wiki|Donnie Darko}}* is the idea of sacrificing one person to save a small American town. In the film, it's the protagonist Donnie that is sacrificed.
* Middlesex and Arcadia Bay are both destroyed by a time vortex resembling a tornado.
* Both in *Life is Strange* and *Donnie Darko* features a well-respected male figure with a secret history of abuse and predation for which he gets busted.
* The first scene of the film shows Donnie waking up from a previous iteration of the time-loop he is stuck into: he gets up off the ground, alone, confused, in a remote area over looking his town, having no clue how he ended up there. This is strikingly similar to what happens to Max in the very first scene of the game.
* In Episode 1, there is a drawing of [w:c:villains:Frank (Donnie Darko)](frank_the_rabbit.md) from *Donnie Darko* on Max's notebook. Frank Bowers' first name is also believed to be a reference to this character.
* In Episode 2, a car license plate in the [Blackwell Parking Lot](blackwell_parking_lot.md) of the Two Whales reads DNNDRK (Donnie Darko).
* In Episode 2, it is shown that Max has a copy of *Donnie Darko* in her room.
* In Episode 2 and *Donnie Darko*, there are scenes involving shooting at glass bottles for target practice.

###  Blue is the Warmest Colour 
*Both *Life is Strange* and *{{wiki|Blue Is the Warmest Color (comics)|Blue is the Warmest Colour}}* are coming of age stories about an introverted girl falling for a wild blue-haired girl who appears to be her polar opposite in interests and personality.*[File:Clementine-emma-bleu-est-une-couleur.jpg](thumb.md)*
*Both revolve around LGBT themes.
*Clementine and Emma from the graphic novel version of *Blue is the Warmest Colour* look nearly identical to Max and Chloe from *Life is Strange*.
*It's very likely that Max keeping a diary is inspired by the diary Clementine keeps that the graphic novel revolves around.

###  The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo 
* Both *Life is Strange* and *The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo* revolve around the search for a woman who has been missing for long period of time.
* Both villains keep documentation of their victims in photos.
* Chloe's skull shirt from Episode 1 closely resembles the skull motif on Lisbeth's shirt in the Swedish version of the movie.
* A poster in Chloe's and Dana's rooms looks identical to the one used in a promo for the American movie version.
* Both villains own a sleek, high-tech dungeon for imprisoning and photographing their victims, who are all young women.
* Both Nathan Prescott and Martin Vanger acquired their psychopathic tendencies from their fathers. In the game, Nathan Prescott develops his psychotic urges as a reaction to his father's overbearing expectations. It could also be argued that Mr. Jefferson becomes a surrogate father for Nathan and tries to teach him to funnel his anger into his sadistic artwork, but is inevitably unable to control him.

###  Stephen King 
During a CNC conference about realism in video games that was held in June 2015, Cano confirmed that {{Wiki|Stephen King}}'s work was a source of inspiration in the creation of the game's plot and its universe.[https://www.lesnumeriques.com/jeux-video/reel-dans-jeu-video-representation-experience-a2225.html Le réel dans le jeu vidéo : représentation et expérience] (June27, 2015) Several references to Stephen Kinng's novels can be found in the game.
* In the parking lot Max spots [Frank Bowers](frank_bowers.md)'s sleeping dog and calls it "{{Wiki|Cujo}}". Cujo is a rabid canine and central character in the same-titled novel written by Stephen King.
* If Max talks to Justin at the Vortex Club party he'll refer to Max as "Maximum Overdrive", a reference to the same-titled Stephen King film.
* In Max's nightmare when sneaking behind Frank Bowers with a flashlight, he says, "Me and Rachel are floating down here in the sewer... Come on down!", which is a reference to Stephen King's *IT*.
* When entering the girls dorm for the first time, the first room on the right got "REDRUM" written on the whiteboard and that room has the number 217 (Stella Hill's room). Both number and the writing refer to the book *{{wiki|The Shining (novel)|The Shining}}* by Stephen King.

###  Gone Home 
* Creative director Jean-Maxime Moris and game and art director [Michel Koch](michel_koch.md) said they are fans of games like *Gone Home*, and Koch himself was even in contact with *The Fullbright Company* after the latter's game launched in 2013.[https://www.polygon.com/2014/8/14/6003109/remember-me-creators-next-game-looks-like-gone-home-with-time-travel Remember Me creator's next game looks like Gone Home with time travel] (August 14, 2014)
* Both games feature coming-of-age stories set in Oregon, U.S., that also rely heavily on environmental storytelling. The story revolves around the relationship between two teenagers, not unreminiscent of the relationship between Max and Chloe.
*A possible direct reference to *Gone Home* could be Arcadia Bay's location: in a postcard found in Chloe's room, we learn that Arcadia Bay's ZIP code is 97141. *Gone Home* takes place in Boon County, OR, which happens to have the same ZIP code. In real life, this ZIP code belongs to Tillamook, the area which directly inspired Arcadia Bay. It also confirms that *Life is Strange* and *Gone Home* aren't set in the same universe.

Chloesroom-rachelpostcardback.png|Postcard from *Life is Strange*.
Gonehome.png|Postcard from *Gone Home*.

###  Buffy the Vampire Slayer 
* The big football event that is set to take place on the final day of the game (Friday, October 11th) is between the [Bigfoots](blackwell_bigfoots.md) and the Sunnydale Razorbacks (as seen on a flyer that lists the scheduled games with full team names). Sunnydale is a fictional Californian town on the TV series *{{Wiki|Buffy the Vampire Slayer}}*.
*According to an [https://youtu.be/7DGgxSbRWio?t# 14m5s interview with Gamespot], Co-game Director Michel Koch states that his second-favorite TV show of all time is *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*. (His first is *Twin Peaks*.)
* A couple of the characters in *Life is Strange* were inspired by characters from *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*. (See the *Characters* section below.)
* In Episode 1, a vehicle license plate of "BFFVMPRSLR" references the show in the Blackwell parking lot.

Sunnydale_reference.png|Game schedule flyer with the *Sunnydale* reference.

### Soundtrack Inspiration
* The music in *Life is Strange* appears to be heavily influenced by {{Wiki|Friday_Night_Lights_(TV_series)|Friday Night Lights}}. Not only is much of the music in a very similar mood and sound, but they actually closely share many of the same artists. Both feature music by {{Wiki|José_González_(singer)|José González}}, {{Wiki|Bright_Eyes_(band)|Bright Eyes}}, {{Wiki|Mogwai|Mogwai}}, and {{Wiki|Sparklehorse}}.

##  Scientific References 
[File:Max_Theories_about_Time_and_Time_Travel.jpg](thumb.md)One of the things *[Life is Strange](life_is_strange.md)* is full of, is scientific references, focused of course, around scientifically controversial issues about time travel, its paradoxes and "what", "why" and "how" does Max Caulfield a seemingly "normal" teenager, can bend time and space. There are a lot of references to modern science and possible explanations for [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md)'s rewinding power.

###  Butterfly Effect 
The {{Wiki|Butterfly Effect}} itself is "branch" of chaos theory, that theorizes about the sensitive dependence on initial conditions in which a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state. The Butterfly Effect is a recurring theme in *Life is Strange*. Besides the blue butterfly which symbolizes the butterfly effect amongst other things, this theory is referred several times by several characters including Max, Chloe and Warren.

###  Chaos Theory 
{{wiki|Chaos Theory}} is a branch of mathematics focusing on the behavior of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. "Chaos" is an interdisciplinary theory stating that within the apparent randomness of chaotic complex systems, there are underlying patterns, constant feedback loops, repetition, self-similarity, fractals, self-organization, and reliance on programming at the initial point known as sensitive dependence on initial conditions. Besides the namesake episode there are several characters that refer to the Chaos Theory directly or indirectly.

###  Grandfather Paradox 
In contrary to general popular belief, the {{Wiki|Grandfather paradox}} doesn't refer only the old riddle "If I go back in time and kill my grandfather when he was a kid, I can never born, so how did I went back in time and killed my grandfather?". This is just the most intriguing question proposed, the paradox itself revolves around the fact that any action that alters the past, since there is a contradiction whenever the past becomes different from the way it was. Therefore, the Grandfather paradox is present throughout the game.

###  Law of Thermodynamics 
The {{wiki|Laws of Thermodynamics}} define physical quantities like temperature, energy, and entropy that characterize thermodynamic systems at thermal equilibrium. The laws describe how these quantities behave under various circumstances, and preclude the possibility of certain phenomena such as perpetual motion. The only reference found in the game is a written statement by Max claiming that they can obviously be broken.

###  Multiverse Theory 
The {{wiki|Multiverse Theory}} also known as an omniverse or meta-universe, is a hypothetical group of multiple universes. Together, these universes comprise everything that exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, energy, and the physical laws and constants that describe them. The different universes within the multiverse are called "parallel universes", "other universes", or "alternate universes". Obviously this is one of Max's conundrums, as she often wonders about what happens to the original reality she just altered, the more prominent case being the "alternative reality timeline".

###  Newton's Laws of Motion 
{{wiki|Newton's Laws of Motion}} are three physical laws that, together, laid the foundation for classical mechanics. They describe the relationship between a body and the forces acting upon it, and its motion in response to those forces. More precisely, the first law defines the force qualitatively, the second law offers a quantitative measure of the force, and the third asserts that a single isolated force doesn't exist. Warren makes a direct reference to Newton's third law when in Episode 5, he states "For every action there is a reaction."

###  Quantum Entanglement 
{{wiki|Quantum Entanglement}} is a physical phenomenon that occurs when pairs or groups of particles are generated, interact, or share spatial proximity in ways such that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently of the state of the others, even when the particles are separated by a large distance. After pulling an all-nighter to research about her power, thanks to one of the bases of this physical phenomenon, Max arrives to the conclusion "...that time as a FRAGILE FOUNDATION. Nothing is written in stone."

###  Schrödinger's Cat 
{{wiki|Schrödinger's cat}} is a thought experiment, sometimes described as a paradox, devised by Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1935. It illustrates what he saw as the problem of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics applied to everyday objects. The scenario presents a hypothetical cat that may be simultaneously both alive and dead, a state known as a quantum superposition, as a result of being linked to a random subatomic event that may or may not occur. Schrödinger's cat is present throughout the game and in several ways and forms. Max writes about it after pulling an all-nighter to research, Warren makes a joke in a message to Max and you may even consider the Sacrifice Arcadia Bay ending, as a Schrödinger's cat example, everybody is alive and dead until one is asserted.

###  Strange Attractors 
In the mathematical field of dynamical systems, Strange Attractors are a kind of {{wiki|Attractor}}. An attractor is called strange if it has a fractal structure. This is often the case when the dynamics on it are chaotic, but strange non chaotic attractors also exist. If a strange attractor is chaotic, exhibiting sensitive dependence on initial conditions, then any two arbitrarily close alternative initial points on the attractor, after any of various numbers of iterations, will lead to points that are arbitrarily far apart (subject to the confines of the attractor), and after any of various other numbers of iterations will lead to points that are arbitrarily close together. Thus, a dynamic system with a chaotic attractor is locally unstable yet globally stable: once some sequences have entered the attractor, nearby points diverge from one another but never depart from the attractor. Chloe calls Max the perfect example of a Strange Attractor.

###  Tourism in Time 
Tourism in Time or Time Tourists is a term usually used to describe the presence of people or objects with anachronisms in photos or other images, one of the most famous being a woman with a cellphone in a Charlie Chaplin movie. The term rose to fame after Dr. {{wiki|Stephen Hawking}} referred it in a lecture. Max after pulling an all-nighter to do research on her power arrives to the conclusion, at least one of them, that she may be one of Hawking's fabled Time Tourists.

###  Wormhole Theory 
At a given time Max can use her laptop for research about her power, after opening a page about {{Wiki|Wormhole}} Theory, she will comment on how that theory makes sense. If taken into account how her power works during the rewind Max may actually be right. She may indeed open a wormhole in the fabric of time, (not space), allowing her to go back in time and not to have moved at all in space. This would also explain why pause rewind is harder for Max to perform, in Kate's rescue, under this theory when she pauses time, she actually has to open a wormhole in the fabric space/time as she needs to move herself as well. Further, supporting this theory, is the fact that the rewind position in the timeline is indicated by a "swirl meter" that resembles a crude drawing of a wormhole in the corner of the screen.

##  Characters 

###  Max Caulfield 
* [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md)'s surname is a reference to Holden Caulfield, the protagonist of the {{Wiki|J. D. Salinger}} novel *{{Wiki|The Catcher in the Rye}}*, a student at an exclusive boarding school like Max, and an icon for teenage rebellion and angst.This reference was confirmed in an [http://www.siliconera.com/2015/02/05/life-strange-director-talks-theme-identity-visual-novels/ interview] with Creative Director [Jean-Maxime Moris](jean_maxime_moris.md). Both have similar personality traits such as the urge to preserve innocence. A central aspect of *The Catcher in the Rye* is the dilemma of Holden's state in between adolescence and adulthood. There are several other references to that book throughout the game, such as "the WINGER and the COW" poster in [Max's Room](max_s_room.md) which has a very similar style to the cover of *The Catcher in the Rye*, or the red cap in the principal's secretary office which resembles the hat Holden wears; she also calls it "phony" which is a characteristic word used many times by Holden in the novel.
* Max might also be based on Clementine/Adele from the French graphic novel and film *{{Wiki|Blue Is the Warmest Color (comics)|Blue is the Warmest Color}}*. Both are young queer women coming of age with similar hair who fall for a wild blue haired girl. The graphic novel version of their retrospective characters look nearly identical.

###  Chloe Price 
* [Chloe Price](chloe_price.md)'s character might be based on {{Wiki|Lisbeth Salander}} from *{{Wiki|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (disambiguation)|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo}}*. The female protagonist has a very similar attitude and punk rock style like Chloe; she has the same badass attitude, short colored hair, tattoos and piercings, wears boots and skull motifs. A poster in Chloe's room looks identical to the one used in a promo for the American movie. Chloe's skull shirt from Episode 1 closely resembles the skull motif on Lisbeth's shirt in the Swedish version. Though it's not directly linked to Chloe, Rachel's dragon tattoo is very similar to the dragon image on the Swedish version's film cover.
* Chloe might also be based on Emma from the French graphic novel and film *{{Wiki|Blue Is the Warmest Color (comics)|Blue is the Warmest Color}}*. Both characters are punkish, rebellious teenage girls with short blue hair and are queer who falls in with a girl who is seen as their opposite in personality. The graphic novel versions of their retrospective characters look nearly identical.
* It's possible that Chloe is partly inspired by the protagonist of the old animated MTV series *Daria*. Daria Morgendorffer is a smart, acerbic, and somewhat misanthropic teenage girl who observes the world around her. The phrase "Everybody Lies, No Exceptions" that is written on Chloe's wall is a line from the old animated MTV series *Daria*. Chloe is even drawn in a cool little Daria style next to it.

###  Mark Jefferson 
* [Mark Jefferson](mark_jefferson.md)'s character is possibly based on Patrick Wilson's character Jeff Kohlver from the movie *{{Wiki|Hard_Candy_(film)|Hard Candy}}*. In the movie, Jeff Kohlver is a pedophile who lures teenage girls back to his apartment under the pretense of doing modeling for him. He then uses that opportunity to take advantage of them. Later in the movie, Jeff admits to photographing another man as he raped and killed another girl. Both Mr. Jefferson and Jeff Kohlver are stylish, charismatic men in their early thirties with careers in photography. Their appearances are very similar - both have short brown hair, light beards, and are in good shape for their age. They both also wear thick-framed glasses and smart casual clothing such as suit jackets. Jeff Kohlver's plans are ultimately foiled by 14-year-old Hayley Stark, echoing Mr. Jefferson's downfall at the hands of Max.
* Jefferson's name might be based on {{Wiki|Mark Jefferson (geographer)|an American geographer and cartographer}} or {{Wiki|Mark Jefferson (cricketer)|a New Zealand cricketer}} who are both called Mark Jefferson.

###  Victoria Chase 
* It is possible that the name "[Victoria Chase](victoria_chase.md)" was chosen as a nod towards {{Wiki|Joss Whedon}}, given that Victoria has the same name as and fills an equivalent role to character {{Wiki|Cordelia Chase}} from *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*.

###  Warren Graham 
*According to Artistic Director Michel Koch, [Warren Graham](warren_graham.md)'s character is inspired by {{Wiki|Xander Harris}} from *Buffy the Vampire Slayer* who "has this kind of awkwardness in him and is always saying the wrong things, but he's a good guy".[http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/first-love-and-awkwardness-inside-the-mind-of-life-is-strange-co-director-michel-koch-423 First Love and Awkwardness: Inside the Mind of ‘Life Is Strange’ Co-Director Michel Koch] (August 4, 2015)

###  Kate Marsh 
* The combination of [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md) 's middle and last name may be a reference to the character Beverly Marsh in {{Wiki|Stephen King}}'s *{{Wiki|It (novel)|IT}}*.
* Kate's rabbit [Alice the Rabbit](alice.md) may have been a reference to the white rabbit in *{{Wiki|Alice in Wonderland}}* that leads Alice to Wonderland.

###  Zachary Riggins 
*[Zachary Riggins](zachary_riggins.md) 's last name, "Riggins" is a reference to NBC primetime drama, *Friday Night Lights*. [Mark Jefferson](mark_jefferson.md)' s voice actor, [Derek Phillips](derek_phillips.md)  starred in the series as a character named Billy Riggins.

###  Frank Bowers 
*[File:Hitman from Mulholland Drive - Frank Bowers.jpg](thumb.md) [Frank Bowers](frank_bowers.md) seems to be modeled after the Hitman from *Mulholland Drive*.
*His last name may be a reference to {{Wiki|Stephen King}}'s* {{Wiki|It (novel)|IT}}* where the leader of the bullies is named Henry Bowers. Frank's first name is believed to be a reference to "[w:c:villains:Frank (Donnie Darko)](frank_the_rabbit.md)" from *Donnie Darko*.
* Frank's RV has the number plate "BRKBD", a reference to the television show *{{Wiki|Breaking Bad}}*, in which drug dealer Walter and his accomplice Jesse cook Crystal Meth in an RV.

###  David Madsen 
*[David Madsen](david_madsen.md)'s character design may be based on a composite sketch from the first season of the *X-Files* which very closely resembles David's faceSee here for a comparison: [http://lifeisstrangegame.tumblr.com/post/119525570124/shutupandtakethisurl-i-was-watching-x-files http://lifeisstrangegame.tumblr.com/post/119525570124/shutupandtakethis]. It's pretty likely since Artistic Director Michel Koch is a big fan of this series and there are several other references throughout the game.

###  Dana Ward 
*[Dana Ward](dana_ward.md)'s first name might be a reference to the main character Dana Scully from the TV series *X-Files*.

###  Samuel Taylor 
*[Samuel Taylor](samuel_taylor.md)'s character may be an analog to the character of the Log Lady in *Twin Peaks*. Like the Log Lady, Samuel is seen as a strange, creepy, or quirky character, and has a seemly supernatural connection to the town with uncanny insight into its mysteries.

###  Rachel Amber 
*[Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md) is likely based on Laura Palmer, a well-liked teenage girl whose mysterious disappearance sets off the plot of *Twin Peaks*. Laura Palmer and Rachel Amber share the same birthday, July 22nd.

###  Officer Anderson Berry 
* [File:Deputy Andy Brennan Twin Peaks - Officer Anderson Berry.jpg](thumb.md) The police officer is similar to the character Dale Cooper from the series *Twin Peaks*, who also very consistently praised pies from the local café. In the game, the officer praises Joyce Price's pumpkin pies at the Two Whales Diner.
* [Officer Berry](officer_anderson_berry.md) appears to be modeled after deputy [w:c:twinpeaks:Andy Brennan](any_brennan.md) from *Twin Peaks*. Apart from general similar looks, they share the same first name (Anderson, shortened to Andy) and even the prominent mole on the exact same spot, on the right, slightly above the mouth.

###  Other Residents 
* The [R.J. MacReady](fisherman.md) sitting immediately to the right of the diner door is the spitting image of Detective Holder from *The Killing*.
* The man standing next to the newspaper machines when Max first visits the diner appears to be modeled after {{Wiki|Christopher_Moltisanti|Christopher Moltisanti}} from *The Sopranos*.

##  Locations 

###  Arcadia Bay 
The developers conducted research on the setting by travelling to the Pacific Northwest for the purpose of conveying a nostalgic and autumnal feel to the game. The development team visited the region, took photographs, looked at local newspapers and used Google Street View to make sure the environment was accurately portrayed. There are a lot of locations [Arcadia Bay](arcadia_bay.md) is based off.

The name, Arcadia Bay, is heavily speculated to be named after the 90's play Arcadia, by Tom Stoppard. In the play, Stoppard examines the effects of time and how the decisions we make affect the people of the future, which is a common theme found in the game.

(TBC)

###  Two Whales Diner 
[File:Blue Moon Diner.jpg](thumb.md)
The Two Whales Diner likely is based on the Blue Moon Diner, located in {{Wiki|Beaverton, Oregon}}. The interior is incredibly similar, and there is a newspaper article in the [Plane](airplane.md) in Episode 5 with the headline "Two Moon Diner?" which connects the names of the two diners with each other. Fun fact: The official website of the Blue Moon Diner says "Welcome fellow time travelers" in the upper-left corner and someone posed as Max Caulfield in the comments, stating, "Couldn't decide between the Bacon omelette and the Belgian waffle, they're both hella good." This is a reference to Max's decision in Episode 2. Another comment, made by someone posing as Chloe Price says, "Come here all the time with my bestfriend. Love the bacon omelette its hella amazing." And someone else pretending to be Warren Graham stated, "Love this place! Me and my [Everyday Heroes Photo Contest](everyday_hero.md) always make sure to hit up this diner for an early dinner before heading off to the drive-in. Those Belgian waffles are hella tasty!"Official Blue Moon Diner website: http://bluemoondinerpdx.com/

###  [Dark Room (Location)](dark_room.md) 
[File:Guro_Illustration_Wall_Next_to_Screen_Dark_Room.png](thumb.md)
A signed {{Wiki|Ero guro}} illustration is framed on one of the walls, fitting the atmosphere.

##  Episode One - "[Episode 1: Chrysalis](chrysalis.md)" 
###  Vision 
*The beginning of "Chrysalis" mirrors, albeit marginally, the beginning of Remedy Entertainment's Xbox 360 launch title, *{{Wiki|Alan Wake}}*. In their dreams, both Max Caulfield and Alan Wake believe the point of safety is a lighthouse seen in the distance and the player is meant to walk towards it. 
* Another possible inspiration could be the very first scene of *Donnie Darko* where he is waking up from a previous iteration of the time-loop he is stuck into: he gets up off the ground, alone, confused, in a remote area overlooking his town, having no clue how he ended up there. This is exactly what also happened to Max in the very first scene of the game.

###  Blackwell Academy 
*Max mentions in her [Max's Diary](diary.md) that she borrowed the book *{{Wiki|The October Country}}* by {{Wiki|Ray Bradbury}} from [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md) and that she owns a copy of *{{Wiki|Battle Royale}}.*
*[File:Max's scribbles.png](thumb.md)The doodles on Max's notebook in Jefferson's class include the phrase "[w:c:gameofthrones:Winter is Coming (motto)](winter_is_coming.md)", which is a reference to the central motto of *{{Wiki|Game of Thrones}}*.It expresses the sentiment that there are always dark periods in each our lives, and even if things are good now ("summer"), we must always be ready for a dark period when events turn against us ("winter"). This can be considered a foreshadowing regarding the following dark events. There also seems to be a scribble of [w:c:villains:Frank (Donnie Darko)](frank_the_rabbit.md) from *Donnie Darko*. Frank The Rabbit is a person named Frank in a life-size demonic-looking rabbit costume who has the ability to move through time, and who warns Donnie, the protagonist of *Donnie Darko*, that the world is going to end in a specific amount of time. His objective is to guide Donnie in his path to correcting the timeline of the primary universe to prevent the world's destruction.
*At the beginning of the episode, Mr. Jefferson utters "Bueller", when no one volunteers to answer one of his questions, referring to the protagonist from the 1986 American teen comedy film ''{{Wiki|Ferris Bueller's Day Off}}'', a carefree teenager who pretends to be sick and skips school one beautiful spring day.
*During his lecture, Jefferson references several famous artists and their works: TBA
*When talking to Max, Mr. Jefferson recites {{Wiki|John Lennon}}'s famous quote, "Life is what happens while you're busy making other plans," when talking to Max in his classroom.
*When Max is answering to principal Wells "You look a little stressed out, are you okay?", she replies with, "I'm... I'm just a little worried about my... future," which is a clear reference to the 1967 movie *{{Wiki|The Graduate}}* where the protagonist uses that phrase when something is stressing or troubling him.
*On an [Steve Hackney](advertisement.md) for the formation of a band, which can be found in the Blackwell hallway, the following musicians are mentioned: {{Wiki|The Ramones}}, {{Wiki|The Shins}}, {{Wiki|The Beatles}}, {{Wiki|The White Stripes}}, {{Wiki|The Smiths}}, {{Wiki|The Who}}, {{Wiki|The Style Council}} and {{Wiki|Lady GaGa}}.
*The name of the person who hung up the advertisement might be a reference to Steve Hackney, a former UK rugby player.
*[File:Eye of providence.png](thumb.md){{Wiki|Eye of Providence|*The Eye of Providence*}}, also knows as the All-seeing Eye of God, appears at several places around the school. It can be seen all over Blackwell Academy's campus, for example in the girls' bathroom, the [Prescott Dormitory](prescott_dormitory.md), at the entrance of the parking lot. It also appears in Chloe's room.
*When looking at the window in Jefferson's classroom after rewinding for the first time, Max says she feels like she's in *{{Wiki|Groundhog Day}}*, a comedy movie about a man who is caught in a time loop and has to experience the same day again and again. Max also comments that her situation despite the resemblance to the film isn't funny referring to it being a comedy piece.
*When [Ms. Grant](ms__grant.md) refers to Blackwell "going back to 1984" when talking to Max about her anti-surveillance petition, she is referencing the {{Wiki|George Orwell}} novel *{{Wiki|Nineteen Eighty-Four}}*. Written in 1949, *Nineteen Eighty-Four* focused on omnipresent government surveillance and thus represents a parallel to David Madsen's planned surveillance at Blackwell.
*[Brooke Scott](brooke_scott.md)'s hoodie design from this episode is a reference to *Star Wars*, representing three light sabers, as officially confirmed by [Don't Nod](dontnod.md) on Twitter.DONTNOD confirmed this reference on [https://twitter.com/DONTNOD_Ent/status/727889665034989568 Twitter] on the 4th of May, 2016, the international {{Wiki|Star_Wars_Day|Star Wars Day}}. 
*The game Brooke is playing on her mobile phone in the first two episodes seems to be a racing game at first glance, but is actually a reference to the {{Wiki|Nerf}} brandMore in [https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/4xnvmp/this_is_what_brooke_plays_on_her_phone_when_we/ this reddit post]..
*Brooke's drone seems to be a HiFly drone, model B400 EVO. It has a similar shape and the same paintjob as the gunship character Trace flies in DONTNOD's first game *Remember Me*.
*The t-shirt [Justin Williams](justin_williams.md) wears in this episode is a reference to the 1975 shark attack thriller *{{Wiki|Jaws (film)|Jaws}}*, directed by {{Wiki|Steven Spielberg}}. It says "RAWS" and has a similar style to the film cover.
*Chloe's skull shirt from Episode 1 closely resembles the skull motif on Lisbeth's shirt in the Swedish version of the movie *The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo*, which is also the logo of the punk band *The Exploited*.

the girl with the dragon tattoo skull shirt.jpg|Lisbeth's shirt motif
Misfit Skull.jpg|Chloe's shirt motif

* The graffiti "hole to another universe" seen in Chloe's room seems to have been heavily inspired by a product made by the American designer Dan Golden in April 2012. Strangely enough, the same picture features a guitar almost identical to Max's and the [https://www.whatisblik.com/collections/dan-golden other products] from this designer all revolve around time-travel.

DG-HoleToAnotherUniverse.jpg|Dan Golden's hole to another universe's wall sticker

###  Prescott Dormitory 
*On the dormitory grounds, there is a scratch on a tree that reads "Make art, not war". This is a reference to the famous anti-war slogan.
*The message "REDⱭЯUM" on [Stella Hill](stella_hill.md)'s room slate and her room number being 217 are references to {{Wiki|The Shining (novel)|*The Shining*}}, a novel by {{Wiki|Stephen King}}; hence Max's comment about never going in there.[File:Poker Face Max.png](thumb.md)
*There is a reference to the [w:c:meme:Poker Face](_pokerface__meme.md) on Max's room slate.
*Victoria's room slate says, "Be the change you wish to see - {{Wiki|Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi}}".
*On the dorm hall's walls, [Brooke Scott](brooke_scott.md) has posted an advertisement for her Geek Grrls Book Club for which she intends to read and discuss fantasy and science fiction authors like {{Wiki|Ursula K. LeGuin|K. LeGuin}}, {{Wiki|Robin Hobb}}, {{Wiki|Neil Gaiman}}, {{Wiki|Piers Anthony}}, {{Wiki|Terry Brooks}}, {{Wiki|David Calvo}}, {{Wiki|Marion Zimmer Bradley}}.
* Another poster on the dorm's walls advertizes a gun club called Young Guns which is located at Heming Way. These could be references to the *{{Wiki|Young_Guns_(film)|Young Guns}}* movie and novelist {{Wiki|Ernest Hemingway}}.  
*The poster in Max's room for "the WINGER and the COW" has a very similar style and design to the cover of *The Catcher in the Rye* by J. D. Salinger.

the winger and the cow.jpg
the catcher in the rye cover.jpg

*Looking at her wardrobe Max mentions John Huges' movie *{{Wiki|Pretty in Pink}}*.
*In [Victoria's Room](victoria_s_dorm_room.md), Max sees her TV and says she'd like to sneak in and watch *{{Wiki|Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within}}*. The film was rendered by Square Pictures, a consolidated subsidiary of {{Wiki|Square Enix}}, the publisher of *Life is Strange*. However, Michel Koch said in an interview that Christine Divine actually thinks it is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made and wanted the reference to be in the game. Square Enix asked if they were sure about it.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?vxhxh3Iy_3Ic&t# 1h6m22s Life Is Strange Spoilercast - Kinda Funny Gamescast Special]
*A receipt showing the clerk's name as "{{Wiki|Amelia Pond}}" can be found in Victoria's room. This is a reference to one of the Doctor's companions in the British time travel series *{{Wiki|Doctor Who}}*.
*When Max rearranges Victoria's photos, she mentions {{Wiki|Tetris}}.
*When Max takes Warren's [Warren's Flash Drive](flash_drive.md) from [Dana's Room](dana_s_room.md), Max says, "Must protect my precious, so Max never has to chase it down again." It is a reference to how [w:c:lotr:Gollum](gollum.md) speaks in [w:c:lotr](_the_lord_of_the_rings_.md)*.*
*Warren's flash drive has pirated films and television shows including *{{Wiki|Doctor Who}}*, *{{Wiki|The X-Files}}*, *{{Wiki|Full Metal Alchemist}}*, *{{Wiki|Akira (film)|Akira}}*, *{{Wiki|The Twilight Zone}}*, *{{Wiki|Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!}}*, *{{Wiki|Tetsuo}}*, *{{Wiki|Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (film)}}*, *{{Wiki|Cannibal Holocaust}}*, *{{Wiki|Beneath the Valley of the Ultra-Vixens}}*, and *{{Wiki|Nekromantik|NEKRomantik}}.*
*Warren's science homework folder is called "Weird Science - Homework", a reference to the film *{{Wiki|Weird Science (film)|Weird Science}}*.
*In the Prescott Dormitory, on a board it says there will be a viewing of *{{Wiki|The Nightmare Before Christmas}}* on October 16th.
*On [Dana Ward](dana_ward.md)'s laptop, [Trevor](trevor.md) mentioned playing *[w:c:mariowiki](super_mario.md)*.
*On a poster by [Michelle Grant](michelle_grant.md) about surveillance, it says "Don't Let Big Brother Watch You". {{Wiki|Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother}} is a character or symbol in {{Wiki|George Orwell}}'s novel *{{Wiki|Nineteen Eighty-Four}}*, which is about a dystopian surveillance society.
*The student [Steve Hackney](steve_hackney.md) advertises a band on a noticeboard and states his influences are: {{Wiki|The Ramones}}, {{Wiki|The Shins}}, {{Wiki|The Beatles}}, {{Wiki|The White Stripes}}, {{Wiki|The Smiths}}, {{Wiki|The Who}}, {{Wiki|The Style Council}} and {{Wiki|Lady GaGa}}.

: [Some references Max makes to artists in her room might be missing]

###  Parking Lot 
*In the [Blackwell Parking Lot](parking_lot.md) of [Blackwell Academy](blackwell_academy.md), there are references to several television series on the license plates:

* Chloe's license plate "TWN PKS" is a reference to the 1990 drama *Twin Peaks,* an American television serial drama, which also takes place in Pacific Northwest and is centered around the mysterious disappearance of a well liked teenage girl prior to the series start. There are also two hills in San Francisco (the city where Chloe's parents took a photo together when Joyce was expecting Chloe) with the same name. It is a very prominent tourist attraction.
*Also in the parking lot Max spots [Frank Bowers](frank_bowers.md)'s sleeping dog and calls it "{{Wiki|Cujo}}". Cujo is a rabid canine and central character in the same-titled novel written by Stephen King.
*There's a reference to the [w:c:meme:LOL Guy](lol_guy_meme.md) in Chloe's truck.
*When looking at Warren's new car on the parking lot, Max calls it his "{{Wiki|WABAC machine|Wayback Machine}}", a reference to the time machine from the 1960/70s American animated television series *{{Wiki|The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show}}*, which was used to visit and alter famous events in human history.
*Warren suggests Max could've started a {{Wiki|Kickstarter}} fund with a photograph of Victoria covered in paint if the player chooses to comfort Victoria instead of making fun of her.

###  Chloe's Truck 
*On the dashboard of [Chloe's Truck](chloe_s_truck.md) stands a bobble head which appears to be based on the "Wacky Wobbler '68 Special" bobble head of {{Wiki|Elvis Presley}} by the Funko company.

###  Chloe's House 
*The graffiti on Chloe’s wall that says “everybody lies no exceptions” is a line from the old animated MTV series *{{Wiki|Daria}},* which is focused on Daria Morgendorffer, a smart, acerbic, and somewhat misanthropic teenage girl who observes the world around her. Chloe is even drawn in a cool little Daria style next to it.

[File:Postcard.png](thumb.md)
*One of [Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md)'s postcards to Chloe has "Only stupid people have good relationships"The writing on the postcard is actually misspelled: "Only stupid people have good relashionship". written on it - a reference to the film and graphic novel *{{Wiki|Ghost_World (film)|Ghost World}}*, which is about two cynical best friends and misfits, Enid and Rebecca, who slowly start to drift apart after graduating from high school. There's also a small Enid drawn on the card next to the speech bubble.
*A poster in Chloe's room looks identical to the one used in a promo for the American movie version of *The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo*.

*Another poster in Chloe's room is very clearly a blotchy version of the poster for John Carpenter's 1982 film *The Thing*.

the thing.jpg

*When Max studies a poster of [Arcadia Bay](arcadia_bay.md) in Chloe's house, she quotes American novelist {{Wiki|Thomas Wolfe}}'s book ''You Can't Go Home Again.''
*The cover image on Chloe's blue hair colour dye is identical to an image of a German Youtuber and Blogger called Ira Vampira who is famous for often colouring her hair.

*In the garage of the [Madsen Household](madsen_household.md), the license plate is "TRDTCTV", a reference to *[w:c:truedetective](true_detective.md)*.
*At her house, Chloe compares herself to [w:c:tomb-raider:Lara Croft](lara_croft.md), the protagonist of the *[w:c:tomb-raider](tomb_raider.md)* series. Square Enix published the 2013 reboot of *Tomb Raider*.
*When sitting on the swing in Chloe's garden and contemplating, Max likens herself to a "real" Lara Croft.
*When Chloe shows Max David's gun, she says, "I'm Price... Chloe Price." This is a reference to how [w:c:jamesbond:James Bond](james_bond.md) always introduces himself in the *[w:c:jamesbond](james_bond.md)* series.
*The license plate of the car in [David's Garage](david_s_garage.md) reading "TRDTCTV" can be seen. This is a reference to the American crima drama tv series'''' which premired in 2014.

###  Lighthouse 
*There are a couple of graffiti on a shack near the [lighthouse](lighthouse.md), one of those is of a symbol that represents the characters in a French novel by {{Wiki|Alain Damasio}}, a co-founder of [Don't Nod](don_t_nod.md), named *La Horde du Contrevent* (or *The WindWalkers)*. Wind is a recurring theme in the novel, and upon looking at the graffiti, Max says, "Weird, those [glyphs](glyphs.md) remind me of... the wind."
* Near the lighthouse, Max can approach a boulder with the message "Trust No One" spray-painted on its face. It's a slogan from *{{Wiki|The X-Files}}.*

###  Max's Diary 
* On page 12 of Max's journal, there is a sticker saying "Not all those who wander are lost", which is the second line of a {{Wiki|All that is gold does not glitter|poem}} by {{Wiki|J. R. R. Tolkien}}.

NotAllWanderers-LIS1-sticker.png
maxdiary-page12.png

* On page 22 is a sticker graphic that says, "Three Meters Above The Sky", which appears to reference the 2004 Italian film inspired by the novel *Tre metri sopra il cielo* by Federico Moccia (literally "Three meters above the sky"). The film is summarized as "A romantic drama for teenagers that tells the story of two youngsters belonging to opposite worlds. It's the chronicle of an improbable relationship that is practically impossible but just as inevitable. It will end up dragging the couple along for a voyage of discovery on which they will experience true love together for the first time. She is a well-to-do girl. He is a rebellious boy, addicted to risk and danger*."*Plot summary of 'Three Meters Above the Sky": https://www.globomedia.es/en/cinema/3-meters-above-sky [http://variety.com/2010/film/reviews/three-steps-above-heaven-1117944186/ Variety magazine] writes: "Slowly, he becomes more tender, [the girl] more rebellious." The descriptions of these two characters appear to match the characters of Max and Chloe rather well.

##  Episode Two - "[Episode 2: Out of Time](out_of_time.md)" 
###  Prescott Dormitory 
* While studying quantum physics and time travel, Max makes several references to well-known time travel theories including {{Wiki|Schrödinger's Cat}}, {{Wiki|Stephen Hawking}}'s {{Wiki|Time_travel#Tourism_in_time|Tourism in Time}} and the {{Wiki|Quantum entanglement|Quantum Entanglement}}.
* [File:Max_room_paradox_book.png](right.md) The "Theory, Paradoxes & Possibilities" book seen on the floor of Max's room in this episode could perhaps be based on a 2013 [https://www.space.com/21675-time-travel.html online article] about time travel, which is titled, "Time Travel: Theories, Paradoxes & Possibilities". (The two white lines that sit above the "Theory, Paradoxes & Possibilities" title on Max's book could be an artistic representation of the two words, "time travel", as text is commonly represented on the game textures by way of bars and squiggles.)
* On Max's request, Warren listed some time travel films in an email including *{{Wiki|The Time Machine (1960 film)|The Time Machine (1960)}}*, *{{Wiki|Primer (film)|Primer}}*, *{{Wiki|Time After Time (1979_film)|Time After Time}}*, *{{Wiki|Pulp Fiction}}*, *{{Wiki|Somewhere in Time (film)|Somewhere in Time}}*, *{{Wiki|G.I. Samurai|Time Slip/G.I. Samurai}}*, *{{Wiki|Timecop}}.*

* Warren's email account icon is a picture of the {{Wiki|TARDIS}}, the time machine in the British time travel series *{{Wiki|Doctor Who}}*. He also refers to himself as "The Doctor", the protagonist of the series, in his email and text messages.
* Warren mentions *{{Wiki|Back to the Future}}* in his email to Max. After her request regarding information on relativity, wormholes and time travel, he texts Max if he's now Doctor Who or {{Wiki|Emmett_Brown|Doc Brown}} and that "he'll be in the TARDIS getting his {{Wiki|DeLorean time machine|DeLorean}} ready", again referring to *Doctor Who* and *Back to the Future*.
* In her Halloween party invitation email, Dana refers to herself as "Dana of the Dead", in reference to the zombie horror movie *{{Wiki|Dawn of the Dead (2004_film)|Dawn of the Dead}}*.
* When Max waters Lisa the Plant, she says, “Drink up… it’s got electrolytes”. The quote is a reference to the film *{{Wiki|Idiocracy}}*.
*There's a pack of Mystic Enchantment cards in Max's drawer; a reference to the popular trading card game {{Wiki|Magic: The Gathering|Magic}}.
*When looking at her guitar, Max says, "Meanwhile, my guitar gently sleeps", which is a reference to the Beatles song *While My Guitar Gently Weeps*.
* After warning [Alyssa Anderson](alyssa_anderson.md) about the toilet paper in the hall of the girls’ dormitory, she asks Max what her favorite science-fiction film is. The player has the choice of choosing between *Back to the Future*, *{{Wiki|Looper (film)|Looper}}* and *{{Wiki|Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day}}* when answering Alyssa.
* Kate's book, *The October Country* by Ray Bradbury, comprises 19 short stories that often deal with macabre themes, celebrity pressures and end in death, paralleling Kate Marsh's situation with the viral video and her suicide.
*Max suggests that Kate is in her {{Wiki|H.R. Giger}} period upon seeing Kate's recent dark-themed drawings.
* If the player chose to make fun of Victoria, Max's room will be trashed and vandalized. On the ground, nearest to her radio, is a ruined copy of *{{Wiki|Donnie Darko}}*.

###  Dormitory Grounds 
* When attempting to get the second photograph achievement, "Full Exposure", Max likens the squirrel she lures out of into the open with a doughnut to the Kraken. The {{Wiki|Kraken}} is a mythological creature of Scandinavian origin, recently popularized by the 2006 and 2010 films ''{{Wiki|Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest}}* and the remake of the *{{Wiki|Clash of the Titans (2010 film)|Clash of the Titans}}''. By shouting "Release the kraken!" she makes reference to the popular meme.
* Warren's t-shirt in this episode contains a cartoon drawing of a box and a "meow!" bubble speech imposed above it, a reference to the Schrödinger's cat theory. He later texts Max and declares "he's no Schrödinger's kitty".
* Warren mentions that the drive-in at Newport is showing a *{{Wiki|Planet of the Apes}}* film marathon.
* When Max declines Warren's invitation to the drive-in, he makes a joke about her being a "damn dirty human", in reference to the quote "damn dirty ape" from *Planet of the Apes*.

###  Blackwell Academy Bus 
[File:Orca.jpg](thumb.md)
While Max is riding the bus, two boats can be seen on the left side of the main road. One of these boats is named "The Orca", which is likely a reference to the boat of the same name in the movie Jaws (which is theme alluded later in the game).

###  Two Whales Diner 
* In the parking lot of the [Two Whales Diner](two_whales_diner.md), there are references to several television series and films on the license plates:

Licence_Plate_Reference_(EP2)-07.jpg|#6 "GRNDHGD" - *{{Wiki|Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day}}*

* The name of the Fisherman’s boat, "Bali Hai", is a reference to the {{Wiki|Rodgers and Hammerstein}} song “Bali Ha'i”, featured in the 1949 musical *{{Wiki|South Pacific}}* based on the 1947 novel *{{Wiki|Tales of the South Pacific}}* by James A. Michener.
* When speaking with the Fisherman outside the diner, the name on the table plate reads "R.J. MacReady". R.J. MacReady is the name of the protagonist of {{Wiki|John Carpenter}}'s 1982 horror film, *{{Wiki|The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing}}*, portrayed by Kurt Russell.
*The fisherman sitting immediately to the right of the diner door is the spitting image of {{Wiki|List_of_The_Killing_characters#Stephen_Holder|Detective Holder}} from *{{Wiki|The_Killing_(U.S._TV_series)|The Killing}}*.
*There is a store called "ACFC Drive-Thru" on the same street as the Two Whales Diner. This is a reference to "{{Wiki|KFC}} Drive-Thru".
* On the inside wall of a bathroom stall in the Two Whales Diner, "I aim to misbehave" is written. The phrase is a reference to the 2005 film *{{Wiki|Serenity (film)|Serenity}}*, a sequel to the cancelled 2002 FOX series *{{Wiki|Firefly (TV series)|Firefly}};* both were written and directed by Joss Whedon.
* Another graffiti written on the bathroom walls is "KATE MARSH LOVE U LONG TIME"; the phrase "love you long time" is refers to the film *Full Metal Jacket*.
* On the mirror of the bathroom, the phrase "Fire Walk With Me" is written on the mirror. The phrase is a passage of poem recited by spirit BOB and the title of the film *{{Wiki|Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me|Fire Walk With Me}}*, a prequel to the events of *{{Wiki|Twin Peaks}}*.
* There is a photo of Joyce with {{Wiki|Ken Kesey}} over the jukebox. It is worth noting that Ken spent the majority of his life in Oregon.

**The name "Dick Weber" might be a reference to Bowling Legend Richard Anthony Weber, better known as {{Wiki|Dick Weber}}.
**The name "Rich Conrad" might be a reference to American singer {{Wiki|Richard Conrad}}.
* There is a brochure advertising local fisherman and former television personality [Jack Cousteau](jack_cousteau.md)'s business. His name is a reference to {{Wiki|Jacques Cousteau}}, a French naval officer, explorer, conservationist, filmmaker, innovator, scientist, photographer, author and researcher who studied the sea and all forms of life in water.
* There is a flyer advertising "Moby Deck Tours", which is a wordplay on the title *{{Wiki|Moby Dick}}*.
* In the Two Whales Diner, Joyce calls Max "{{Wiki|Nancy Drew}}", referencing to a 18-year-old girl who spends her time solving mysteries, the protagonist of a mystery fiction series created by publisher {{Wiki|Edward Stratemeyer}}.
* Max mentions that the jukebox in the diner is playing “I Got You Babe”. She finds it ironic, given the similarities between her own story and the film *Groundhog Day* that featured that song prominently. The song, performed by Etta James, was also featured in the 2014 Valentine’s Day DLC for *{{Wiki|The Last of Us}}*, *{{Wiki|The Last of Us: Left Behind}}*.
* When Chloe and Max meet up in the diner, Max refers to Chloe and her secret hideout as "Girl Wonder" and "Chloe's Cave", as a reference to {{Wiki|Batman}} and his sidekick {{Wiki|Robin (comics)|Robin}} also called "The Boy Wonder".

* Chloe remarks that she's "Hungry like the Wolf" during the diner scene with Max. "Hungry Like the Wolf" is an official single performed by British new wave band {{Wiki|Duran Duran}}.The writer who adapted the original story for *Life is Strange*, [Christian Divine](christian_divine.md), seems to be a fan of Duran Duran as [https://twitter.com/Chris_divine/status/873195086284279810 he made a post on Twitter] in celebration of the birthday of Nick Rhodes in June 2017. Nick Rhodes is a founding member and keyboardist of Duran Duran. Christian used a screenshot from *Life is Strange* when Chloe says this line.
* Joyce refers to {{Wiki|Davy Jones' Locker}} when talking to the costumers.

Chloe Jax the Panda Keychain.png|Chloe's panda key chain

###  Junkyard 
* At the very start of this chapter, and if you ignored Kate's call at the diner, Max will say to Chloe: "Wait up, Speedy!" As the S is capitalized, this is likely a reference to the character {{wiki|Speedy Gonzales}}.
* Max can comment on the disused look of an old bus emblazoned with "142," and it's one of the [Optional Photos](optional_photos.md). Christopher McCandless from the film *Into the Wild* lived and died in Fairbanks City Transit System Bus 142.
* "Sleep Perchance 2 Dream" is written on the side of the large boat in the [American Rust Junkyard](junkyard.md), which is a reference to Shakespeare's *Hamlet*.
* When Max talks to Chloe about her stealing David's gun and their rebellion, she refers to her as "Che", which is a reference to {{Wiki|Che Guevara}}, an Argentine {{Wiki|Marxism|Marxist}} revolutionary who was the major figure of the {{Wiki|Cuban Revolution}} and whose stylized visage has become a ubiquitous counter cultural symbol of rebellion and global insignia in pop culture.
* Max says to Chloe, "Nice shootin', Tex." This is a memorable line from the 1984 supernatural comedy film {{Wiki|Ghostbusters}}. It is said by the character Dr. Peter Venkman, played by {{Wiki|Bill Murray}}.
* In her journal, Max references the infamous exploding head scene from *Scanners* in regard to the headache caused by overusing her powers.
* When Frank encounters Chloe and Max on the junkyard, he refers to them as "{{Wiki|Thelma and Louise}}", "{{Wiki|Abbott and Costello}}" and "{{Wiki|Bonnie and Clyde}}".
* Chloe and Max reenact the railroad scene from the coming off age film *Stand by Me*. Writer Jean-Luc confirmed the reference on Facebook adding that it's one of his favorite films.[https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid10153383767188183&set# pb.699003182.-2207520000.1452557976.&type3&size# 960%2C720 Facebook post] | [http://puu.sh/msmnt/5ef9944a20.jpg Screenshot]
* Max mentions American novelist and poet {{Wiki|Jack Kerouac}} when explaining the attraction of train tracks to Chloe.
* When the player grabs the pliers to cut the wires in the fuse box near the train tracks, Max declares she can "pull a Macgyver". *{{Wiki|MacGyver}}* was 1985-1992 series centered around the titular character, Angus MacGyver, who could use everyday appliances and duct tape in unorthodox ways to escape perilous situations.

###  Blackwell Academy
* The picture of a cat with a bow-tie and glasses sitting in front of a science lab board in one of Warren's text messages to Max is a reference to the popular [http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/chemistry-cat Chemistry Cat meme], which features scientific puns usually based on the names of chemical elements from the periodic table or various laws of science and physics.

WarrenSMSPicture2.png
chemistry cat meme.jpg
chemistry cat meme example2.jpg

* At Blackwell Academy, Max is given two nicknames. [Evan Harris](evan_harris.md) refers to Max as "Maxwell Smart" before telling they'll speak later. Maxwell Smart was a character in the 1965-1970s sitcom *{{Wiki|Get Smart}}* that ran on NBC and later CBS. Warren calls Max "Maxwell Silver Hammer" in the science class. "Maxwell's Silver Hammer" is the name of a single performed by {{Wiki|The Beatles}}.
* Inspecting the beakers on the counter in the science lab, Max says, "Bring me the brain, Igor!" {{Wiki|Igor (character)|Igor}} is a "stock character" for horror films of the 1930s, inspired by the assistant from the first *{{Wiki|Frankenstein}}* film.
* In the two instances Warren's science experiment fails the with use of potassium or sodium, Warren makes two references. If the player chooses potassium, Warren will call the failure "Weird Science". *{{Wiki|Weird Science}}* is a 1985 teen comedy written and directed by John Hughes. If the player chooses sodium, Warren will remark "She Blinded Me With Science". "She Blinded Me With Science" is a 1982 single performed by {{Wiki|Thomas Dolby}}.
* When Warren's experiment succeeds, he calls Max "the next {{Wiki|Werner Heisenberg}}". He'll also say, "Check out the big brain on Max!", which is a reference to the 1994 crime drama *Pulp Fiction*.
* Jefferson says, in reference to [Kate Marsh](kate_marsh.md), "maybe she doth protest too much," a reference to {{Wiki|The lady doth protest too much, methinks|"the lady who doth protest too much, methinks"}} from the play *{{Wiki|Hamlet|"Hamlet"}}* by {{Wiki|William Shakespeare}}.
*Jefferson's license plate can be seen in the end cutscene reading "TPFTHLK". This is a reference to the 2014 mystery drama tv series '[w:c:Top of the Lake](top_of_the_lake.md)'' which follows a female detective who investigates the disappearance of a 12-year-old girl in the fictional town of Laketop.

##  Episode Three - "[Episode 3: Chaos Theory](chaos_theory.md)" 
###  Prescott Dormitory 
* Some people on the Missing Persons list on Max's laptop are references to famous authors:
** There is an entry for "Winston Smith" who went missing in 1984. This is a reference to George Orwell's *1984*, where Winston Smith is the main character. At the end of this novel, he also is presumed to go missing. The missing since date is the same as the date the novel was published, July 8.
** There is an entry for "Elton Kesey" who went missing on November 10, 2001. This is a reference to Kenneth Elton "Ken" Kesey, an American author, best known for his novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. The missing since date is the same as the date the author died.
* When turning on her flashlight, Max says "Let there be...", which is a reference to the creation story in the first book of the Bible.
*In the hall, Max can look to a Vortex Club "End of the World Party" poster she will remark; "I'll bet they will party like it's 1999. Assholes." This may be a reference to the famous song by {{Wiki|Prince (musician)|Prince}}, 1999 (Party like it's 1999).
* Max's Facebook header, "Time is Bunk", is a quote from {{Wiki|Douglas Adams}}'s novel, ''{{Wiki|The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy|The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy}}''.
* If Kate Marsh died, Max uses a quote from Jack Kerouac's, *The Dharma Bums*: "Are we fallen angels who didn't want to believe that nothing is nothing..." If Kate Marsh survived, Max uses the first stanza of {{Wiki|William Blake}}'s *The Tyger* from *Songs of Innocence and Experience: *"Tyger Tyger, burning bright / In the forests of the night; / What immortal hand or eye, / Could frame thy fearful symmetry?"
* If Kate Marsh died, Victoria will leave the quote, "Requiescat in pace" as a message on Kate's Facebook profile. "Requiesact in pace", literally meaning "May he or she rest in peace", is a phrase popularized by {{Wiki|Ezio Auditore da Firenze}} of Ubisoft Montreal's ''{{Wiki|Assassin's Creed}}'' series, specifically in Assassin's Creed II, Brotherhood and Revelations.
* If David Madsen was suspended, a Facebook page calling for David to be fired features a Doge meme dressed in a security uniform.
* Warren's quote on the "Fire David Madsen" page, "DAVID MADSEN: MALL COP", is a reference to the film *{{Wiki|Paul Blart: Mall Cop}}*.
* In the Arcadia Bay cleans receipt in Victoria's rooms, the name of the employee who serviced Victoria is named "{{Wiki|Amy_Pondhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)Amelia Pond}}", a reference to the Doctor's companion from the fifth, sixth and seventh seasons of *Dr. Who*.
* When referring to little known facts about Victoria, Max begins her sentences with "Victoria's secret?" Victoria's Secret is major American retail store that was established in 1977 by Roy Raymond.
* Victoria's room contains a glow in the dark [Media:Note3-vicroom-doll.png](figurine.md) that is also an optional photo. Its packaging is located in her trash can and contains a hidden reference that is only revealed through an understanding of English and Chinese. On the front, the only completely legibleThere is a completely illegible word in Japanese hiragana at the top of the packaging. The partially illegible Japanese katakana at the bottom of the packaging, ヌー(?)コス [nu-- (?)ko-su], could mean "new (?) costume", as コス is "costume". This would make sense on the packaging of a figurine. words are: *My*, *Bluberry*, and 之夜之 is an old Japanese kanji possessive particle that the hiragana particle の now replaces in this modern day. But 之 is still used as a possessive article in Chinese. It acts as both "apostrophe s" and "of" in English. 夜 is the Chinese character that means "night". This translates to ''My Bluberry('s) Night* and is believed to be a reference to the film *{{wiki|My Blueberry Nights}}'' - a product of France and China. Perhaps a member of Dontnod's team is a fan of this film.

###  Blackwell at Night 
* When talking to Chloe about Chaos Theory, Max says "I don't see any control over this chaos", another reference to the film *Get Smart*.
* During Chloe's attempt to break into Principal Wells's office, she refers to Max as "Lupin". The character {{Wiki|Ars%C3%A8ne_Lupin|Arsène Lupin III}} of the anime *Lupin III* is famous and notorious thief created by noted manga artist Kazuhiko Katō.
* During her phone call with Warren, Max advises him to "Bubble Hearth", a *{{Wiki|World of Warcraft}} *term that refers to the combination of Divine Shield and Hearthstone which allowed Paladins to transport to escape PVP or general combat. Max also texts him back with "kek" in Episode 1, meaning "Lol" in Orcish.
* The James Bond references return when Warren calls Max "007" in his instructions on how to make the pipe bomb.
* In the Principal's secretary office, Max spots a red cap which she comments with, "Only a total phony would wear a crappy hat like that." This is another reference to Haulden Caulfield from *Catcher in the Rye, *who wears the same kind of hat and calls others "phoney".
* If you rewind time after using the vending machine and use it again while searching through Blackwell at night, Max will make a comment about how she could get every can in the machine with just one coin, with a little {{Wiki|Star Wars}} pun shortly after; "But don't go to the darkside, young Max."
* In the science lab, there is an optional photo opportunity at the skeleton with a cigarette, which may be a tribute to the work *{{Wiki|Skull of a Skeleton with Burning Cigarette}}* by Vincent van Gogh.
* In the science lab, Max uses a variation of {{Wiki|Leonard McCoy}}'s "I'm a doctor, not a..." catchphrase in *{{Wiki|Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series|Star Trek}}* when searching for weed killer.
* When Max buys a drink at the vending machine at school, she says, "Release the kra-can!", in reference to the "[http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/release-the-kraken Release The Kraken!]" meme.
* In Principal Wells's office, when taking the fifth optional photograph for this episode, Max and Chloe quote {{Wiki|Tony Montana}} of *{{Wiki|Scarface_(1983_film)|Scarface}}*: "Say hello to my little friend!" - "Say goodnight to the bad guy!"
* If the player decides to take the money from the handicapped fund in Principal Wells's office, Max mentions making a trip to the {{Wiki|Powell's Books}} located in [Portland](portland.md), Oregon.
* After finding selfies of Victoria in her dressing room locker, Max says, "So Victoria's secret is... selfies", a joke again referencing to America's largest lingerie retailer, ''{{Wiki|Victoria's Secret}}*.
*One of the locker room graffiti tags reads "Rachel Abides", which might be a reference to 1998 film *The Big Lebowski*.
* In the boys bathroom the message "Dana needs a baby daddy" features a Me Gusta meme face.
* In the boys locker room a jacket can be found, which closely resembles the one the protagonist of the 2012 video game *Hotline Miami* wears.
*When Max dive-bombs into the swimming pool, she yells "Cowabunga!", a reference to the cartoon series *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles*.
* In the [Blackwell Swimming Pool](blackwell_pool.md), Chloe and Max make several references to the 1975 shark attack thriller *Jaws'', directed by {{Wiki|Steven Spielberg}}.
**If Max examines a toy shark on the side of the pool, she'll state "Just when I thought it was safe to go back in the water...", a reference to *Jaws 2*.
**When both Max and Chloe are in the pool, Chloe will tease Max by humming the shark's leitmotif. Max gets upset, claiming to still be terrified by the movie.

###  Chloe's House 
* In the Arcadia Bay Police Department's website for missing persons on Chloe's computer, there are two major novel references. One of the persons listed missing in Arcadia Bay is a man named Elton Kesey. {{Wiki|Ken Kesey}} is an American novelist best known for his 1962 novel ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest''. Another, Winston Smith, was listed missing since "6/08/1984". George Orwell's novel, *Nineteen Eighty-Four*, was published June 8, 1949.
*According to David's file on her, Max uses the online aliases Mad Max, Max Factor, and Noir Angel.
*On Chloe's desk, Max can see a book "Mystic weather — supernatural sciences" by Doctor J. Karswell. It is likely a reference to the character Dr. Julian Karswell in the 1957 British horror movie *Night of the Demon.* The movie sets up a familiar "man of reason forced to acknowledge existence of the supernatural" story. Furthermore, the movie was directed by Jacques Tourneur, a French director.

###  Two Whales Diner 
*Outside the dinner, near the fisherman [Media:Weeter.jpg](a_sign.md) can be seen on which "follow us on Weeter" is written. Weeter could be a reference to the social media platform {{Wiki|Twitter}}.
*If you look at the News Interview on the TV at the Two Whales Diner, the doctor's name is "Doctor Hedorah", a possible reference to the Smog Monster from the 11th *Godzilla* series movie, *Godzilla vs Hedorah*.
*The cool-looking 18 wheeler truck in front of the diner is called a Needham 1977. This is a reference to *Smokey and the Bandit*, a 1977 film that was directed by Hal Needham, an actor, writer, director, and stunt man. The film itself featured quite a bit of trucker/CB culture.
*After Max steals the RV keys from Frank and meets up with Chloe, she calls her "The Amazing SpiderMax". A reference to one of the comic book and film titles of {{Wiki|Spider-Man}}, *{{Wiki|The Amazing Spider-Man}}*.
*Chloe and Max call the bone they use to distract Frank's dog a "Scooby Snack", which is a reference to the dog from the *Scooby Doo* franchise.
* In the parking lot of the diner are again references to TV series on the license plates:

###  Garibaldi Picture 
When Max goes back in time to the year 2008, there is a picture on the refrigerator of a sailing boat with the word "Garibaldi" beneath it. It appears that this may be based on the title image of the [http://visitgaribaldi.com/ "Visit Garibaldi"] tourism website. (It is also present on the refrigerator in the 2013 alternative timeline.) Garibaldi, in turn, is one of the towns that inspired the town of Arcadia Bay.

###  Plane 
* The redhead man sitting in front of Max (who is probably a reference to [Michel Koch](michel_koch.md)) is seen playing a video game which looks a lot like {{Wiki|Candy Crush}}, the most famous match-3 game at the moment.

###  Zeitgeist Gallery 
* A series of sculptures in the San Francisco [Zeitgeist Gallery](zeitgeist_gallery.md) seem to depict {{Wiki|John Cleese}}'s signature *{{Wiki|Ministry of Silly Walks}}* walk. When Max looks at the one on the left she says, "That one looks kinda silly." These sculptures are also highly reminiscent of those of expressionist A. Giacometti. In the game files, the model of the sculpture is named "SillyGiaco" which is hinting at both of these references.

* The journalist Danny Lee states that he is currently editing the art section of the "Berkeley People's Herald". His phrase about the "Berkeley People's Herald" might be a reference to the film *{{Wiki|Big Trouble in Little China}}*. (See [http://www.subzin.com/quotes/M973191e3/Big+Trouble+in+Little+China/I%27m+Margo+Litzenberger.+I%27m+with+the+Berkeley+People%27s+Herald. here] for the quote).

*When trapped for too long in the maze, Max can make an inner comment about Freddy Krueger, a character of the "A Nightmare on Elm Street" film series.{{Headphones|file‎VO_E5_7B.STM_208~Act_E5_7B_ArtClass_NightmareLines_Scripted_Max_060.ogg}} Freddy is a demon attacking his victims in their dreams, causing their deaths in the real world as well — which is fitting Max's situation.
*A sequence in the finale involves walking down the same seemingly identical hallway time after time, making small interactions along the way, which closely resembles a sequence from the *Silent Hill* video game.
*The edges of walkways in the labyrinthine segments of Max's nightmare echo the edges of walkways in the Ego Rooms in *Remember Me*.
*One of the lines scribbled in Max's journal during the nightmare sequence reads, "The doe is a lie," which is repeated three times in capitals across the top of the left-hand page. This is a deliberate nod to the popularized line, "The Cake Is a Lie," from the video game {{wiki|Portal (video game)|Portal}},Confirmed by [Alysianne Bui](alysianne_bui.md) who was one of the two artists that worked on the journal. in which a cake is used as a fictitious motivator for the player to perform tasks.
