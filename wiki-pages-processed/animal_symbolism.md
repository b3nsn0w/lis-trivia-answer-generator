#  Animal Symbolism 

[File:Animal_Symbolism_compo.png](thumb.md)
**Animal symbolism** appears in the *[Life is Strange (franchise)](life_is_strange.md)* franchise, usually as a symbol of something important to the story or main characters and often in the form of "spirit animals." Some appear to be connected, guide, watch over or warn the protagonist.
The only developer-confirmed spirit animals so far are the [Blue Butterfly](blue_butterfly.md) ([Chloe Price](chloe.md)), squirrel ([Samuel Taylor](samuel.md)), and the [Doe](doe.md) ([Maxine Caulfield](max.md)).

##  Spirit Animals & Animal Symbolism 

###  *Life is Strange* 
* [Blue Butterfly](blue_butterfly.md) - The blue butterfly could represent a butterfly effect of the choices throughout the game. It could be the catalyst for Max's power as it seemed to glow, had a presence in the air around it and was unaffected by Max's first rewind. The color blue is associated with both the butterfly and [Chloe Price](chloe.md). There is also a poster of a blue butterfly in the [Chloe Price#Alternative Timeline](alternative_timeline_chloe.md)'s empty room as well as butterflies as part of a pattern on Chloe's boots. The only entry in [Max's Nightmare Journal](max_s_nightmare_journal.md) features a drawing of a butterfly with Chloe's head. For Christians butterflies are a symbol of rebirth. The texture file of that drawing is named *Spirit_animal_Chloe*, which reinforces the theory of the butterfly being Chloe's spirit animal. In the Sacrifice Chloe ending, a blue butterfly is landing on Chloe's coffin.In the [Director's Commentary](director_s_commentary.md), it has been said that there is a lot of symbolism behind the butterfly and the fact that Chloe has got some butterflies on her tattoo. Chloe's hair color was confirmed to be based on the blue butterfly.

* [Doe](doe.md) - There are many theories surrounding the true meaning of the [doe](doe.md) in the game. One is that the doe is the spirit of [Rachel Amber](rachel_amber.md). This could be likely considering that it appears over her burial site, and again when the body of Rachel is discovered. Another likely theory is that the doe is simply Max's spirit animal sent to guide her through her time-travel ordeal. It leads her to the burial site days before the discovery of the body, and bows its head in peaceful reverence for the dead when Max and Chloe find the body. Due to the doe T-shirt designs that Max wears (as well as doe necklace during one of the game endings), [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) has a connection to this animal and so the doe could be Max's spirit animal. Another fact that lends more support to this theory is that the doe seems immune to Max's rewind power, just like the blue butterfly Max sees in the girls' bathroom at the start of the game. After Max becomes aware of her power not even the blue butterfly is immune, only Max and the doe seem to share this immunity. The doe also guides Max in two occasions, during the lighthouse climb in the final of Episode 1 and during a short part of her nightmare in Episode 5. [Samuel Taylor](samuel_taylor.md) says that the doe is Max's spirit animal and that it could be a sign of her destiny when she tells him that a doe was looking right at her like it was trying to communicate. Max's personality traits fit far better with the doe spirit animal than that of Rachel, making it likely that it is her true spirit animal, or totem.
* Squirrel - The squirrels in spite the seemingly unimportant presence in the game, they are the only animal present in all five episodes, and they are featured in Max's optional photos for every single Episode. The groundskeeper of Blackwell seem to have a special affinity and connection to the cuddly creatures claiming that his Spirit Animal is in fact a squirrel.

However, it has a dramatic and sometimes frightening presence in [Chloe's Dreams](chloe_s_dreams.md) and is usually seen accompanied by [William Price (Before the Storm)](william_price.md). The raven seems to have taken a particular interest in Chloe herself as it can often be seen watching her and people closely associated with her throughout both episodes, and seemingly influencing her dreams of her father to some unknown end.

# ### Symbolism
*The Raven represents introspection, courage, self-knowledge, courage for self-reflection, transformation of difficulties into blessings, being able to find light within the darkness, divination, change in consciousness new occurrences, eloquence, also trickster, manipulative, mischievous in some cultures and the guardian of secrets in others.

###  *The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit*

In *Captain Spirit*, a raccoon can be found hiding in the [Eriksen Garage](eriksens__garage.md), which Chris can scare away and later finds near the lake.

This was confirmed [Media:LiS-2-Animal-Representation.jpg](here.md). Despite this, animal motifs are used to describe the cast in the form of Sean's story of the wolf brothers. Him, Daniel, and the Diaz-Reynolds family are depicted as wolves. [Brody Holloway](brody_holloway.md) and [Hank Stamper](hank_stamper.md) are depicted as bears, with the former being the friendly one.
