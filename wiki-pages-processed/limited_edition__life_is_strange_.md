##  Art Book 

###  Cover 
[File:Limited Edition - Cover.png](thumb.md)
The cover of the art book is a replica of [Max's Journal](max_s_journal.md). It has 32 pages and is 5.25 inches (13.34 centimeters) wide by 6.75 inches (17.14 centimeters) tall. It is matte black with red white and blue printing resembling tape on the top of the front cover which does not extend to the spine, back, or the inside. The cover of the book has "stickers" on it as well as tape and postal stamps which gives it a kitschy aesthetic. The red white and blue "tape" is also visible on the right side of the first page along with a sticky note with unintelligible text and some doodles. This page has three stamps; one of a barn owl, one of a sailboat, and one of a monarch butterfly. The monarch butterfly may be an allusion to the Butterfly Effect ever-present in the game, the owl may be an allusion to the one that crosses Max and Chloe's path in [Episode 4: Dark Room](episode_four.md), and the sailboat may be an allusion to the boat that destroys the [lighthouse](lighthouse.md) in Max's visions. All the concept art of locations, photos, and paintings are taped to the pages to resemble photographs.

###  Contents 
The pages are printed on thick semi-gloss paper.
# The box art of the game, but instead of saying "Limited Edition" it says "PICTURE BOOK".
# Concept art pictures of [Maxine Caulfield](max.md) and [Max's Room](max_s_dorm_room.md) as well as one of the stickers that appears on the cover of a camera.
# Concept art pictures of [Chloe Price](chloe.md), her tattoo sleeve, [Chloe's Room](her_bedroom.md), the skull symbol on her shirt, and a parental advisory sticker.
# Concept art pictures of [Daniel DaCosta](daniel.md), [Justin](justin.md), and [Blackwell Academy](blackwell_academy.md)'s athletic field and [Blackwell Academy Hallway](hallway.md). This page features art similar to the style Max uses in her journals of the front of the [Prescott Dormitory](prescott_dormitories.md). The page features a taped paper scrap saying "science is boring me to death", a sticker of a hand forming a rock-on symbol, and magazine clippings formed to say "ello W WORLD".
# Concept art of [Warren Graham](warren.md), [Nathan Prescott](nathan.md), [Trevor](trevor.md), [Logan Robertson](logan.md), and Blackwell Academy. A crude face with crosses for eyes is scribbled above the picture of Blackwell Academy and geometry notes are in the background.
# Concept art of [Kate's Room](kate_s_room.md) and Prescott Dormitory, above this are magazine clippings formed to spell "ShOOsh I'm dreaming" and below a sticker saying "My hair is being pulled by the stars again".

# Concept art of [Frank Bowers](frank.md) and [Pompidou](pompidou.md), [Joyce Price](joyce.md), the exterior of the [Two Whales Diner](two_whales.md), and [Frank's RV](frank_s_rv.md). On the photo of Frank's RV, the face Max draws in Episode 1 is drawn onto it and the photo looks dirty. Behind Joyce is a grocery list, which may be an allusion to her calling [William Price](william.md) and causing him to be in an automobile accident. There is a sticker over the picture of the Two Whales that says "BROOT FEST".
# Concept art of the interior of the Two Whales Diner and the fisherman that stands outside of it in [Episode 3: Chaos Theory](episode_3.md). His table is behind him as well as his board that reads "SAVE OUR CITY". A poster is pictured to his left that says the same thing.
# Concept art of the scene in [Episode 2: Out of Time](episode_2.md) in which Chloe and Max visit the [American Rust Junkyard](american_rust_junkyard.md) to shoot bottles, the [Dark Room (Location)](dark_room.md), and in the background there is a doodle of a map of [Arcadia Bay](arcadia_bay.md) with 8 numbered locations; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, and 13.

# Concept art of Chloe's living room, backyard, and a [Vortex Club](vortex_club.md) party poster. In the background there is a doodle of Chloe and Max splashing around in the Blackwell Academy swimming pool and the scribble on Chloe's bedroom wall saying "EVERYBODY LIES."
# Three [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometric_projection Isometric projections] of the Price home, one of the downstairs, one of the upstairs, and one of the exterior of the house. In the background is a sticker saying "BULL SHIT".
# A portrait of Max's profile, a painting of her visions, and in the background there is a doodle of the [lighthouse](lighthouse.md). Above the picture of the lighthouse there is a sticker of a rainbow that is pink, yellow, and blue, which resembles the pansexual flag. This may be a reference or hint to Max's sexuality and/or romantic orientation, or of those of other characters in the game.
# A painting of Max looking out off of a cliff to the water spout or tornado approaching Arcadia Bay. In the background the same image is doodled from another perspective. Above these there is a sticker saying "hello" in cursive and another below it with the words "enjoy the journey."
# Concept art of two beached whales, Arcadia Bay's coast, the lighthouse, and the scene in Episode 2 where Max sees the translucent deer in the junkyard and attempts to photograph it. In the background are two doodles of deer and a note paperclipped to the page saying, with each phrase as a separate bullet, "GET UP, SURVIVE, REPEAT."
# Concept art of a bird's-eye view of Arcadia Bay, the [beach](beach.md), and the path leading up to the lighthouse. In the background there is a doodle of a hill and below that is a note saying "THE HILL" with its text underlined.

In the background there is a recreation of the aforementioned drawing that Max does on Frank's window and a doodle of the train.
# Unused concept art of a scene where Max, bloodied in a hospital gown and bandages, holds her hand out to [rewind](rewind.md) in front of a flipping bus. This may take place during the time when the tornado strikes Arcadia Bay. There are pictures of two parking lots and the truck parked in front of the Two Whales in Episode 2. In the background there are doodles of other cars, and in front of all there is a sticker that says "MIGHT BITE" with the word might crossed out and "WILL" written underneath in red ink.
# A photo of Max and Chloe in a dark setting with Max using the flashlight of her phone. This may be the scene in the junkyard after Chloe and Max find out about Rachel. In the background there is a buck with a monocle and a mustache. Next to it is a crumpled paper saying "OH DEER."
# A painting or concept art of the scene where Max has to save Chloe from being stuck to a railroad track with an oncoming train, and art of Max by herself discovering the dark room. The background features a doodle of Arcadia Bay storefronts. At the very front there is a sticker of a deer laying down.
# Max's drawings from her journal, including Chloe dancing with her back facing the viewer, Max and Chloe holding hands and walking down the railroad tracks, Chloe at a 3/4 angle, Max at a 3/4 angle, Chloe helping Max up after she falls when she wakes from her [Max's Nightmare](nightmare.md), Max overlooking the tornado, and a deer surrounded by roses. The header "My drawings" is in the top left corner in blue ink. The page has stars between most of the drawings.
# Max's drawings from her journal including her holding out her hand to rewind, Chloe sleeping, an iPod playing music through earbuds, Max and Chloe in Chloe's truck, and both of them leaning over the side of the Arcadia Bay swimming pool. A sticker that says "Meanwhile" is in the upper right side of the page.
# A collection of stickers including two birds, a cool-looking cob of corn that says "POP CORN", a punk ghost with the words "punk ass ghost" next to it and "ass" crossed out, a telephone, a kraken and next to it is a speech bubble saying "RELEASE ME!", and a sticker saying "MEMORIES IN TIME." In the background there is a doodle of purple paint being sloshed from a bucket, binders and art supplies, and a set of craft knives with one knife missing. The one knife missing could be a reference to Chloe taking David's gun.
# A collection of stickers including a sticker saying "WARNING: SUBJECT TO SPONTANEOUS OUTBURSTS OF NERD TALK", "It's not the DESTINATION IT'S THE journey", "AIR MAIL", "STARRY NIGHTS, LIFETIME MEMORIES", "now & there", "Do otters get songs stuck in their head?" and a blue fish in a circle. The background has doodles of pill containers, bleeding birds, a sponge with a bowtie, a cassette tape with its tape ripped out saying "RADIO KILLED ITSELF. *video is innocent!", flowers including roses and peonies, a skull with a raccoon sitting on it, and a quote saying "Love is how you stay alive even after you are gone."
# A collection of stickers saying "WTF: What the Fluff", "I'M AN OTHER ONE", "REC.", and "HELLAU SUNSHINE", a maple leaf, max's journal, and crime scene tape. The background has drawings of a circle of trees, Kate Marsh, a lock and key, three goldfish swimming, Chloe's truck speeding away, and the words "TRUE LOVE WAITS". The words "Threemetersabove the sky" are torn at the edges and appear to be glued on.

# The last page, the art credits page, credits concept artists Eduard Caplain, [Gary Jamroz-Palma](gary_jamroz_palma.md), Frédéric Augis, [Alyzian](alysianne_buy.md), [Florent Auguy](florent_auguy.md), and art director [Michel Koch](michel_koch.md). The credits are on a notebook-style paper that has scribbles in each corner and behind this is a picture of [Maxine Caulfield](max.md) hugging [Chloe Price](chloe.md) from behind.

##  Trivia 
[File:Pirate Disk.png](thumb.md)
* The cover art for the Soundtrack CD is based on the cover of a mix tape Max made for Chloe when she was 12. You can find it in a drawer in Alternative Chloe's room in "[Episode 4: Dark Room](dark_room.md)". It is referenced again in [Life is Strange: Before the Storm](_life_is_strange__before_the_storm_.md) and can be found in [Chloe's Room (Before the Storm)](chloe_s_bedroom.md).
* There is an extremely rare Vinyl version.[http://na.square-enix.com/us/blog/life-strange-vinyl-soundtrack-sweepstakes Life Is Strange Vinyl Soundtrack Sweepstakes] Only a few of these vinyls were created as promotional materials for *Life is Strange*, though (like the licensed soundtrack) they aren't sold commercially. Originally it was part of an official give away, later you could win it during [:Category:Livestreams](livestreams.md) or it was available as a prize during *Life Is Strange Fans* community's contests[http://lifeisstrangefans.com/competitions/christmas-contest/ Life Is Strange Fans Christmas Contest] and other giveaways[http://lifeisstrange-blog.tumblr.com/post/154684797850/and-the-2016-life-is-strange-community-heroes Community Heroes] (December 19, 2016).

* The sticker of a cassette tape with its tape ripped out saying "RADIO KILLED ITSELF. *video is innocent!" might be a reference to the Buggles' 1978 song, "Video Killed the Radio Star".

##  Art Book 

###  Cover 
[File:Limited Edition - Cover.png](thumb.md)
The cover of the art book is a replica of [Max's Journal](max_s_journal.md). It has 32 pages and is 5.25 inches (13.34 centimeters) wide by 6.75 inches (17.14 centimeters) tall. It is matte black with red white and blue printing resembling tape on the top of the front cover which does not extend to the spine, back, or the inside. The cover of the book has "stickers" on it as well as tape and postal stamps which gives it a kitschy aesthetic. The red white and blue "tape" is also visible on the right side of the first page along with a sticky note with unintelligible text and some doodles. This page has three stamps; one of a barn owl, one of a sailboat, and one of a monarch butterfly. The monarch butterfly may be an allusion to the Butterfly Effect ever-present in the game, the owl may be an allusion to the one that crosses Max and Chloe's path in [Episode 4: Dark Room](episode_four.md), and the sailboat may be an allusion to the boat that destroys the [lighthouse](lighthouse.md) in Max's visions. All the concept art of locations, photos, and paintings are taped to the pages to resemble photographs.

On the photo of Frank's RV, the face Max draws in Episode 1 is drawn onto it and the photo looks dirty.

There is a sticker over the picture of the Two Whales that says "BROOT FEST".
# Concept art of the interior of the Two Whales Diner and the fisherman that stands outside of it in [Episode 3: Chaos Theory](episode_3.md). His table is behind him as well as his board that reads "SAVE OUR CITY". A poster is pictured to his left that says the same thing.

This may be a reference or hint to Max's sexuality and/or romantic orientation, or of those of other characters in the game.

In the background there are doodles of other cars, and in front of all there is a sticker that says "MIGHT BITE" with the word might crossed out and "WILL" written underneath in red ink.
# A photo of Max and Chloe in a dark setting with Max using the flashlight of her phone. This may be the scene in the junkyard after Chloe and Max find out about Rachel. In the background there is a buck with a monocle and a mustache. Next to it is a crumpled paper saying "OH DEER."

In the background there is a doodle of purple paint being sloshed from a bucket, binders and art supplies, and a set of craft knives with one knife missing. The one knife missing could be a reference to Chloe taking David's gun.
# A collection of stickers including a sticker saying "WARNING: SUBJECT TO SPONTANEOUS OUTBURSTS OF NERD TALK", "It's not the DESTINATION IT'S THE journey", "AIR MAIL", "STARRY NIGHTS, LIFETIME MEMORIES", "now & there", "Do otters get songs stuck in their head?" and a blue fish in a circle.
