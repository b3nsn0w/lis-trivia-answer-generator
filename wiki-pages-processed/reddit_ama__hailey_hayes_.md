###  Question 18 

**ashisnotspooky**

i'm asking questions as they pop in my head

how is it knowing all these technically famous people that you've worked with on LiS or even are just regular friends with? i mean, i know that i know you but i'm curious. do you ever get anxious about what they think of you or maybe even starstruck?

**haileyhayes**

Oh definitely, especially like my first times meeting Daye and Hannah, but they're just such kind warm inviting people that I'm comfortable around them now and I don't get nervous talking to them anymore.

----

###  Question 19 

**GO-ON-A-STEAM-TRAIN**

Hi! :) Thank you for stopping by and answering questions! :)

I was just wondering what recording with the other cast felt like? It must have been surreal getting to be a part of a series you'd played before getting casted! :)

The other thing I was curious about is if you're still in touch with anyone from the voice or game side of things? Would you like to work with anyone in particular again? :)

Thank you again for doing this, Samantha was one of my favourite characters in Before the Storm! :)

**haileyhayes**

Hello! Thank you for stopping by and asking some great questions!

So I actually recorded alone. However, getting to meet up and talk with other members of the original cast such as Daye and Hannah definitely felt surreal and mind blowing because here are two people who brought to life two amazing on screen presences I thought I'd never talk to in my life and now they're inviting me to stream with them and eat waffles together. It's really cool and I wish there was a more eloquent word I could use to sum it up, but I feel like "cool" says it all.
I am definitely still in touch with most of the VAs from both games and Phil, our voice director. Honestly, I'd love to work with any of the VAs on another project again and Phil is my favorite director I've worked with so I definitely would love to work on another project with him.
Ah thank you so much! I'm so glad you enjoyed her and the game!

**GO-ON-A-STEAM-TRAIN**

Thank you so much for your answer! I didn't realise it was a solo mission to perform dialogue! :) I can totally see why the developers would much prefer that, but from how the talking went back and forth I can't believe you weren't in the same room! :) That just made your scene outside Blackwell even more impressive! :)

That's so nice!! :) I'm really happy that you had a blast recording it, and it wasn't a one and done deal. :) I need to have a look into twitch a bit more, it sounds like a bunch of awesome people who worked on the series are on there! :D

Fingers crossed that next project with Phil is in this world, but I really can't wait to see what's next, best of luck, and thank you so much for answering, you've made my day! üòÅ

**haileyhayes**

Thank you so much for participating in the AMA! Have a beautiful day!

###  Question 20 
**PinkAbuuna** 

Hello!

# How are you today?
# If DONTNOD announced a Life is Strange Video Game Universe akin to the MCU, how would you react?
# Best moment when voicing Samantha?
# If you could tell yourself before getting the role of Sam anything, what would you say and why?
# Will you be playing The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit, what game are you currently playing, and what are you hoping to play?
# How many questions in an AMA from one person are too many?

**haileyhayes**

Hello!
#You're super sweet! I'm doing great, thanks, how are you? :)
#Omg I'd be so excited. That would be the coolest thing ever. I can't wait for Life is Strange: Infinity War
# Best moment when voicing Samantha was the "You shut the fuck up" line and also "You should be ashamed" because Phil had me flip him off in the booth while I delivered that line which was pretty cool
# Oh god, if I could tell myself anything before getting Samantha it would be 'Keep pushing forward, all your hard work's about to pay off.'
# I will definitely be playing The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit! I'm super excited for it! Currently, I'm playing South Park: The Fractured But Whole, Heavy Rain, and Inside. I have so many games I'm hoping to play, I think I'm most excited for the Batman: Arkham series, Detroit: Become Human, and the Tomb Raider series
# Oh there can never be enough. One million. That might be excessive, but even then I'd probably answer all one million of them tbh

**PinkAbuuna** 

With #2, would Hawt Dog Man be the "Thanos" of the universe? ü§î 

**haileyhayes**

UM PLEASE. I NEED THIS FAN ART NOW

----
###  Question 21 

**AkashicRecorder**

Hi Hailey!

Since Life is Strange 2 has been said to feature completely new characters, what kind of settings and characters would you personally like to see in it?

**haileyhayes**

Hello!

Awesome question! Well I honestly have no idea what the new season of Life is Strange holds, but I think it would be very cool to follow the adult protagonist of Captain Spirit, even though we still don't know much about him yet!

----

###  Question 22 
**alexmason32**

Hi Hailey! Your performance was fantastic. I seriously felt for Samantha!

My question is how much did you personally relate to Samantha? Was there anything you'd change about her character?

Also, where do you think she'd end up after the game? I'm assuming some kinda prestige college.

Also also, favorite band?

**haileyhayes**

Thank you so much!

When I was Samantha's age, I was really shy and kept to myself a lot. I feel like I try to stick up for people who are misunderstood or wrongfully misjudged. I try to see things from multiple perspectives and not just my own. I wouldn't change a thing about Samantha, I feel like the writers and devs created an exceptionally well rounded character.

Oh, I love the idea of her ending up at some kinda prestige college and I might just steal your idea as my answer, because....I love that. I feel like she'd go into some field where she could help people, maybe even become a therapist/psychologist.

I'm really bad at following bands, but my favorite artists right now are Hayley Kiyoko, Troye Sivan, and P!NK

'**alexmason32**

Thanks so much for answering! And glad you liked my answer, by all means take it!

And I can actually say I'm familiar with those bands/singers!

Oh!! I'm so sorry I almost forgot. What did you think about her relationship with Nathan? I was so concerned for her knowing what he was like. Also my friend Liz is a huge fan, if you could say "Hi Liz!" It would mean much!

**haileyhayes**

Everyone needs someone. I feel like Samantha could really be a positive influence in Nathan's life, but I guess whether or not that happens is up to the player. On the flip side, knowing what Nathan does regardless, I can see why some players prefer the choice of keeping Samantha away from Nathan.

Ah, Hi Liz!! I hope you're having a fantastic day!

'**alexmason32**

I agree! If only Samantha could have helped Nathan. I guess I just really liked the bookish type Samantha was. I mean, I can relate! So even knowing what Nathan was like I still tried to set them up!

Thank you so much for answering my questions! I really look forward to seeing you in more stuff. You're talented and I mean that with sincerity!

**haileyhayes**

Thank you so much!! I really appreciate that!

----

###  Question 23 
**Templarkommando** 

Assuming that there would be an eventual relationship between Samantha and Nathan, what do you think that the eventual relationship between Samantha and Sean Prescott would be like?

Would you be in favor of a direct sequel to LiS: Season 1? What about a direct sequel to BtS?

What is your favorite line in all of BtS?

**haileyhayes**

I feel like at first Samantha would be very shy and quiet when it came to Sean, but after a while, she would stick up for Nathan and even defend herself if it came to that.

I feel like a direct sequel to LiS might be a little difficult, but I trust that if the devs wanted to do one, they'd do a fantastic job! For BtS, it'd be cool to follow the lives of Samantha and Steph and the other new characters from the prequel!

My favorite line in all of BtS is "Life needs a little mystery."

----
###  Question 24 

**ShadowLelouch97**

Hello Hailey! I hope you're having a great day thus far.

#What was the first video game you ever played?
#Do you have a favorite book series? If so, what is it, and what's your favorite book from that series?
#What has inspired you the most by interacting with Life is Strange and its community?
#What fictional place would you like to visit?
#What are your initial thoughts on Captain Spirit.

Once more, have a great day!

**haileyhayes**

Hello! So far so good! How are you doing? :)
#First video game I ever played was honestly probably Crash Bandicoot
#My favorite book series is Harry Potter (I know I'm basic, but what can I say? It's a great series). My favorite book is Order of the Phoenix.
#The LiS community has inspired me so much just through their never ending support. I've never had a support network quite so vast and dedicated as the LiS fans
#These questions are golden. Hmmmm if I could visit one fictional place, I think I would like to visit Camelot with all the magical creatures and adventures that come with it.
#I am so excited for Captain Spirit! I can't wait to cry.

###  Question 25 

**PokemonFangameMaker**

Have you ever played D&D irl?

**haileyhayes**

Yes I have! A few times, but I recently completed my first campaign with my Tiefling sorceress!

----
###  Question 26 

**ManuallyModerated**

Hi Hailey!

Thanks for hanging out so long with us! You are awesome as Samantha and I‚Äôm so glad your a part of this expanding LiS cast!

My question revolves around your other pursuits. Besides gaming ;) what other hobbies do you have or causes that you are passionate about?

Thanks!

P.S. - I‚Äôm literally low-key typing this under my desk so my boss doesn‚Äôt see...I look totally natural right now!

**haileyhayes**

Hello!

Thank you so much! That's very sweet of you to say and ah I'm having a blast!
Hmmm well my other hobbies include cosplay, roleplay, ghost hunting, and acting. I'm a super nerd in all aspects and very proud of it. Causes I'm passionate about are really....just "be kind to others" causes like LGBT, minority, and women's rights. You know, the stuff that shouldn't have to be said in 2018, but still need to be.

P.S. I'm rooting for you! Act natural. Blend in with your surroundings. Become the desk.
