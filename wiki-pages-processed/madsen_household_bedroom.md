*'Joyce and David's Room''' is located upstairs above the kitchen in the [Madsen Household](madsen_household.md). It was the bedroom of [Joyce Price](joyce_price.md) and [William Price](william_price.md), before she started living with [David Madsen](david_madsen.md). The room is equipped with a double bed, a nightstand, a cabinet and a wall closet. The window is located at the opposite side of the door.

##  Episode One - "[Episode 1: Chrysalis](chrysalis.md)" 
When [Maxine Caulfield](max_caulfield.md) enters the room, she has the chance to save the [Blue Jay](blue_jay.md) from death by the window using her [rewind](rewind.md) ability. It will then end up on top of the closet and will make additional appearances at the path leading to the [lighthouse](lighthouse.md) and in later episodes.

##  Episode Three - "[Episode 3: Chaos Theory](chaos_theory.md)" 
Max may only look at the door into the room from outside as she is not sure if David is inside and she doesn't want to disturb David.

##  Episode Four - "[Episode 4: Dark Room](dark_room.md)" 
Max may only look at the door into the room from outside.

##  Alternative Timeline 
In the [Alternative Timeline](alternative_timeline.md), Max can talk to Joyce about Chloe, William and Joyce herself, who is sitting on the bed and reading a book.
