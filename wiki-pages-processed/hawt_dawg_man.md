##  Trivia 

*Hawt Dawg Man was created and designed by concept artist and illustrator [Edouard Caplain](edouard_caplain.md).
*His slogan is "Work hard, mustard big". It originally appeared on a Hawt Dawg Man calendar located in a convenience store in Episode 5 of the original *Life is Strange*. It's also featured on a [https://store.na.square-enix-games.com/en_US/product/462509/life-is-strange-hawt-dawg-man-mug-rewardpromotional Square Enix mug].
*The *Life is Strange Rewind and Play* compact cassette, that was advertised on the [http://eu.square-enix.com/en/blog?p# 411 Square Enix blog] on April Fool's in 2016, features a bonus, dubbed "the never before heard Hawt Dawg Man theme song".[http://eu.square-enix.com/en/blog/rewind-and-play-pre-order-life-strange-soundtrack Rewind and Play - Square Enix blog post] (April 1, 2016)
